{"title": "Giant Satellite Outshines Most Stars in the Sky", "date": "2023-10-02 19:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nAt times, the enormous BlueWalker 3 telecommunications satellite is brighter than some of the most iconic stars visible from Earth\nOn some nights, one of the brightest objects in the sky is neither a planet nor a star. It is a telecommunications satellite called BlueWalker 3, and at times it outshines 99% of the stars visible from a dark location on Earth, according to observations reported today in Nature.\nBlueWalker 3 is the most brilliant recent addition to a sky that is already swarming with satellites. The spaceflight company SpaceX alone has launched more than 5,000 satellites into orbit, and companies around the globe have collectively proposed launching more than half a million satellites in the coming years — a scenario that astronomers fear could hamper scientific observations of the Universe.\nThe study “shows us that there are no boundaries to satellite brightness,” says Patrick Seitzer, an emeritus astronomer at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who was not involved in the study. “I’m concerned that we’re going to see a very large number of large satellites launched in the next decade, and it will change the appearance of the night sky forever.”\nTelecommunications firm AST SpaceMobile in Midland, Texas, launched BlueWalker 3 on 10 September 2022 as a prototype for a satellite fleet designed to make mobile broadband available almost anywhere. The satellite’s huge array of antennas and white colour mean that it reflects a considerable amount of sunlight back towards Earth, making it shine even at twilight.\nTo quantify its effects, professional and amateur astronomers embarked on an international observation campaign, ultimately spotting the satellite from locations in Chile, the United States, Mexico, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Morocco. The researchers assessed the satellite’s shine using a standard astronomical index called the magnitude scale, on which the brightest objects have the smallest numbers. The brilliant Venus, for example, can reach a magnitude of –4.6, whereas the North Star is much dimmer, at magnitude +2. That is roughly the magnitude limit visible from a city with the naked eye.\nOn 10 November 2022, the satellite unfurled its array of antennas, causing it to brighten to magnitude +0.4. If it were a star, it would have been one of the ten brightest in the sky. But its apparent brightness changes as the satellite rotates, and by late December, it had dimmed to a magnitude of +6. It then brightened again, reaching magnitude +0.4 once more on 3 April 2023.\nThe International Astronomical Union, a group of professional astronomers, recommends that artificial satellites in low-Earth orbit have a maximum brightness of magnitude +7. BlueWalker 3 can be hundreds of times brighter, the authors found. And AST SpaceMobile says it plans to provide broadband coverage with a fleet of 90 similar satellites, including 5 that are scheduled to launch in early 2024.\nMoreover, the team observed a bright object separating from the main satellite during deployment, and later learnt that this was the container that protected the folded antennas during ascent, before being jettisoned into space. It, too, was relatively bright at magnitude +5.5.\nIn a statement to Nature, AST SpaceMobile said that it is currently working with NASA and astronomy groups to address these concerns.\nMany astronomers were caught by surprise in mid-2019, when SpaceX successfully launched 60 satellites, creating a ‘train of stars’ that glided through the night sky. Now, low-Earth orbit is littered with thousands of commercial satellites. If captured by a telescope during a long exposure, such objects can leave a bright streak that renders the data unreadable.\nAstronomers have long steered their telescopes to avoid the brightest of these objects. That workaround will still be possible if AST SpaceMobile launches a fleet of satellites similar to BlueWalker 3, says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics ‌| Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was not involved in the study.\nThe bigger concern, he says, is that other companies might also launch constellations of large satellites. If that happens, Seitzer says, “then the night sky will be irreversibly changed.”\nTo avoid such a scenario, astronomers are working to find mutual solutions. Some of the study’s authors, for example, are a part of a newly formed coalition called CPS that aims to tackle the issue and has been in contact with companies including SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. SpaceX is already trying methods to make its satellites less visible, and coalition members say that AST SpaceMobile also seems amenable to dimming its satellites. The company says it is planning to use anti-reflective materials on its next-generation satellites, as well as certain flight manoeuvres to reduce the crafts’ apparent magnitude.\n“They left us with a very good impression that they would work more with us,” says coalition member Constance Walker, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab in Tucson, Arizona, and also a study author.\nSuch discussions are the way forwards, she says. “No one is going to return to yesterday, when we had darker skies.”\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on October 2, 2023.\nShannon Hall is an award-winning freelance science journalist based in the Rocky Mountains.

In addition to the climate threat, residents in that part of the country often have reduced access to health care services and “more limited employment opportunities,” the report says.\nTaken together, “households in this region may struggle to manage expenses if flooding events result in reduced working hours, or damage or destruction of household property,” wrote Treasury officials.\nAppalachia isn’t the only region at risk. The report highlighted similar problems in the southwestern United States, which is exposed to wildfires, and the Mississippi Delta, which is vulnerable to spells of extreme heat.\nHigh temperatures can be especially dangerous for Americans with less wealth.\n“Lower-income households often lack access to air conditioning, which may make them more susceptible to heat-related illnesses,” the report said. “Additionally, households in the Mississippi Delta are more likely to include older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. These households may experience financial strain from added healthcare and utility costs.”\nThe dual threat of climate impacts and social vulnerability isn’t a new problem. But policymakers say it’s an issue that deserves a robust response.\n“We know managing financial risk is not a new challenge, especially for low income and underserved communities who are often extremely sophisticated budgeters,” Suzanna Fritzberg who serves as a deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department, said Friday during an event hosted by the Urban Institute.\n“But it is an emerging risk, it is complex,\" Fritzberg added. \"It has both near-term and long-term challenges.\"\nThe report comes more than two years after President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to consider the financial threats of climate change.\nThat has resulted in a range of actions from the Treasury Department, including working with a council of top financial regulators to examine how natural disasters and the transition away from fossil-based energy could affect the global financial system.\nThe agency also has called on property and casualty insurers to provide ZIP-code-level data about climate-fueled financial risk, and it more recently released principles meant to streamline financial firms’ climate commitments.\nEven so, more work needs to be done.\nThe report outlines several examples of how climate impacts or disasters can affect household finances. That includes an interruption of income, particularly for outdoor workers in industries such as agriculture, tourism and construction. Floods and wildfires can also be devastating for families who do not have the savings required to quickly repair their homes.\nThose scenarios are made worse, Treasury argues, by the fact that many households are both underinsured and face high insurance premiums — further cutting into their savings and leaving their homes unprotected.\nAlso notable is that in the wake of a disaster some households turn to loans or credit cards to cover costs — and struggle to make payments on existing debt. That can increase their likelihood of default, an outcome that can have a long-term impact on credit scores and access to money.\n“That was really our goal with this report, was to try to really put the granular household-level focus on some of these broader events where we see the macro-level impacts and the costs, but understand how it really reflects in people’s day to day lives,” Graham Steele, Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial institutions, said Friday.\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "An mRNA Pioneer Discusses How Her Work Led to the COVID Vaccines", "date": "2023-10-02 17:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nBiochemist Katalin Karikó and her colleague Drew Weissman were recently awarded a $3-million Breakthrough Prize for their work\nEditor’s Note (10/2/23): Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on mRNA, which led to COVID vaccines that have protected billions of people. Karikó discusses some of the key advances in this interview from 2021.\nResearchers often toil away for years in a lab without any promise that their research will result in anything meaningful for society. But sometimes this work results in a breakthrough with global ramifications. Such was the case for Katalin Karikó, who, along with her colleague Drew Weissman, helped develop the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology that was used to produce the highly effective COVID vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna.\nKarikó, who is now senior vice president and head of RNA protein replacement therapies at BioNTech (the company that co-developed a COVID vaccine with Pfizer), and Weissman, a professor of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, have just been awarded a $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for their work on modifying the genetic molecule RNA to avoid triggering a harmful immune response. The Breakthrough Prizes, founded by Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan, Mark Zuckerberg, Yuri and Julia Milner, and Anne Wojcicki, honor groundbreaking discoveries in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics. (Earlier this year Karikó received the Vilcek Prize for Excellence in Biotechnology, a $100,000 award that recognizes the extraordinary contributions immigrants make to society and culture.) Karikó spent years on this research despite skepticism and a lack of funding. Ultimately, however, her efforts paid off—laying the groundwork for the overwhelmingly effective vaccines that are likely the world’s surest way out of the COVID pandemic.*\nKarikó was born in Hungary to a family of modest means. She started her work on modifying RNA during her Ph.D. studies and—convinced of the promise of RNA-based therapies—came to the U.S. to pursue postdoctoral research. She later ended up as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Interest in mRNA therapies declined, and she was told to pursue other research directions or risk losing her position, but she persisted. Over a conversation at the Xerox machine she got to know Weissman, who was interested in developing vaccines at the time. They started collaborating.\nWhen foreign mRNA is injected into the body, it causes a strong immune response. But Karikó and Weissman figured out a way to how to modify the RNA to make it less inflammatory by substituting one DNA “letter” molecule for another. Next they worked on how to deliver it. After testing many different delivery vehicles, they settled on lipid nanoparticles as the delivery vehicle. These turned out to work incredibly well: the nanoparticles acted as an adjuvant, a substance that enhances the desired immune response to a vaccine.\nWeissman and his colleagues had been working on an mRNA vaccine for influenza when word spread of a mysterious pathogen causing pneumonia in people in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Weissman quickly realized this virus was a perfect candidate for an mRNA vaccine, and Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna soon pivoted to work on one. The rest is history.\nScientific American spoke with Karikó about how she came to work on mRNA, why it was well suited for COVID vaccines and what other exciting medical applications it could have.\n[An edited transcript of the interviews follows.]\nWhat was your initial reaction to winning the prize? Were you surprised, or did you expect this?\nKARIKÓ: No, I never expected any kind of prize. For many decades, I never got anything. I was very happy with doing the work. Getting a letter from a New York elderly home where they celebrated that, with the vaccine, nobody died when they got the infection—for me, those are the real prizes. I was aware of this Breakthrough Prize—it’s very famous. But, you know, I never thought about any kind of prize. So it was a very, very pleasant surprise.\nDid you ever expect this technology to have such a global impact, in terms of the COVID vaccines? Or was it just something you were working on at the right place and time for this pandemic?\nKARIKÓ: I never wanted to actually develop a vaccine. I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies. And when, in 2000, we learned that adding messenger RNA (which I made) to human immune cells, they made inflammatory molecules—cytokines—I thought that I had to do something. I tried to make sure that when we are using it for a therapy—you know, such as treating a patient who has had a stroke—we don’t add some extra inflammatory molecules. At the beginning, it was thought that the immune form of this RNA would be a good vaccine. In 2017 the first paper was published showing that the modification we discovered that makes the mRNA noninflammatory could lead to a good vaccine, and the Moderna and BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines both have this modification.\nHere at BioNTech, I am in charge of the protein replacement program. We use modified mRNA for cancer treatment. And this is not a vaccine. This is mRNA coding for cytokines and injecting them into tumors to make the tumor “hot” so that immune cells will learn what to see and can eliminate metastatic tumors. We did not know that there would be a pandemic, but I was aware that this is a very good way to make a vaccine because, with my colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, we had already used it not just for Zika virus but for influenza, HIV, herpes simplex—it was already demonstrated in animal studies that it is such an excellent vaccine.\nSo when the pandemic started, was it immediately clear to you that this could be a useful technology to develop COVID vaccines?\nKARIKÓ: From 2018 we had worked with Pfizer to develop a vaccine for influenza. And we were already ready to start a clinical trial for that. But switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing. And so it was already ready.\nIf the pandemic had happened 20 years ago, you would need to have, physically, in your hands, a piece of the virus. So that would be a big delay. But commercial gene synthesis started about 20 years ago. Now you can just order a gene. You order DNA, and then you insert it into a [typically circular molecule of DNA called a] plasmid, and then you make RNA. But making the nanoparticle to deliver the mRNA is kind of challenging.\nThe lipid nanoparticles were a key part of the technology to make it useful for vaccines, right?\nKARIKÓ: In my view, yes. The lipid nanoparticle protects the mRNA outside the cell because, in the blood and everywhere, there are a lot of human enzymes that can degrade the RNA. Second, it helps it to enter because the cell will pick up the particle. And then it is in the endosome [a membrane-bound compartment] in the immune cells, and then this lipid nanoparticle helps escape from the endosome to the cytoplasm [the solution inside cells] so the protein can be made. It is a very smart particle.\nDo you see this technology being useful for many other types of applications, such as the cancer treatment you mentioned earlier?\nKARIKÓ: It is already. When we started here at BioNTech, injecting messenger RNA coding for cytokines, by that time, the human trial using mRNA for cancer vaccines had already been going on for years. Other program with the nucleoside-modified mRNA was already ongoing at other companies. For example, Moderna is producing antibodies for chikungunya virus. [In a collaboration with AstraZeneca] they already have a phase II trial [led by the latter company] injecting mRNA into the heart [that] codes for [a protein that] generates new blood vessels. And they are also running a clinical trial for wound healing. So the data were out there—you already saw these ongoing trials for mRNA therapy—and it was just people who are not in the field who were not aware. They thought, “Oh, this is the first use.” No, there are many, many other applications.\nHas all this new interest in mRNA changed this field? Do you think it will accelerate the development of mRNA vaccines for other diseases, such as influenza?\nKARIKÓ: Yeah, if you read the Wall Street Journal article [interviewing] Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, you know, he said that Pfizer will pursue mRNA vaccines for other diseases. They will treat autoimmune disease. We published this year, at BioNTech, that we use tolerization [exposing someone to an antigen, or substance that provokes an immune response, until they can tolerate it]. We use an animal model for multiple sclerosis, and we showed that you can use tolerization to treat an autoimmune disease if the mRNA codes for the autoantigen. Before, it was like CureVac, Moderna, BioNTech—these were smaller companies working with RNA. And now, all of the sudden, you can see that Sanofi is buying into other companies, Pfizer is doing it, and so the large companies are realizing that they can get many products in their pipeline very quickly.\nDo you think that this mRNA technology could be a good candidate for a universal coronavirus vaccine?\nKARIKÓ: I think that it could work for all vaccines except those against bacterial infections. [It could work for vaccines against] viruses and parasites, such as [those that cause] malaria and, of course, for cancer—but we have to understand better what to target.\nWhat do you plan to do with the prize money?\nKARIKÓ: Probably, I will use it for research. I will make a company. When I got a smaller award, I gave it back to those who needed it more—for the education of underprivileged children. I am 66 years old and never had a new car, and I don’t think I would have one now.\nEditor’s Note (10/6/21): This article has been edited after posting to correct the description of Katalin Karikó’s work in 2000 involving mRNA in human immune cells and to clarify some of her comments.

{"title": "The State of Large Language Models", "date": "2023-10-02 16:00:00", "text": "We present the latest updates on ChatGPT, Bard and other competitors in the artificial intelligence arms race.\nLAUREN LEFFER: At the end of November, it’ll be one year since ChatGPT was first made public, rapidly accelerating the artificial intelligence arms race. And a lot has changed over the course of 10 months.\nSOPHIE BUSHWICK: In just the past few weeks, both OpenAI and Google have introduced big new features to their AI chatbots.\nLEFFER: And Meta, Facebook’s parent company, is jumping in the ring too, with its own public facing chatbots.\nBUSHWICK: I mean, we learned about one of these news updates just minutes before recording this episode of Tech, Quickly, the version of Scientific American’s Science, Quickly podcast that keeps you updated on the lightning-fast advances in AI. I’m Sophie Bushwick, tech editor at Scientific American.\nLEFFER: And I’m Lauren Leffer, tech reporting fellow.\n[Clip: Show theme music]\nBUSHWICK: So what are these new features these AI models are getting?\nLEFFER: Let’s start with multimodality. Public versions of both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard can now interpret and respond to image and audio prompts, not just text. You can speak to the chatbots, kind of like the Siri feature on an iPhone, and get an AI-generated audio reply back. You can also feed the bots pictures, drawings or diagrams, and ask for information about those visuals, and get a text response. \nBUSHWICK: That is awesome. How can people get access to this?\nLEFFER: Google’s version is free to use, while OpenAI is currently limiting its new feature to premium subscribers who pay $20 per month.\nBUSHWICK: And multimodality is a big change, right? When I say “Large language model,” that used to mean text and text only.\nLEFFER: Yeah, it’s a really good point. ChatGPT and Bard were initially built to parse and predict just text. We don’t know exactly what’s happened behind the scenes to get these multimodal models. But the basic idea is that these companies probably added together aspects of different AI models that they’ve built—say existing ones that auto-transcribe spoken language or generate descriptions of images—and then they used those tools to expand their text models into new frontiers. \nBUSHWICK: So it sounds like behind the scenes we’ve got these sort of Frankenstein’s monster of models?\nLEFFER: Sort of. It’s less Frankenstein, more kind of like Mr. Potato head, in that you have the same basic body just with new bits added on. Same potato, new nose.\nOnce you add in new capacities to a text-based AI, then you can train your expanded model on mixed-media data, like photos paired with captions, and boost its ability to interpret images and spoken words. And the resulting AIs have some really neat applications.  \nBUSHWICK: Yeah, I’ve played around with the updated ChatGPT, and this ability to analyze photos really impressed me.\nLEFFER: Yeah, I had both Bard and ChatGPT try to describe what type of person I am based on a photo of my bookshelf.\nBUSHWICK: Oh my god, it’s the new internet personality test! So what does your AI book horoscope tell you?\nLEFFER: So not to brag, but to be honest both bots were pretty complimentary (I have a lot of books). But beyond my own ego, the book test demonstrates how people could use these tools to produce written interpretations of images, including inferred context. You know, this might be helpful for people with limited vision or other disabilities, and OpenAI actually tested their visual GPT-4 with blind users first. \nBUSHWICK: That’s really cool. What are some other applications here?\nLEFFER: Yeah, I mean, this sort of thing could be helpful for anyone—sighted or not—trying to understand a photo of something they’re unfamiliar with. Think, like, bird identification or repairing a car. In a totally different example, I also got ChatGPT to correctly split up a complicated bar tab from a photo of a receipt. It was way faster than I could’ve done the math, even with a calculator.\nBUSHWICK: And when I was trying out ChatGPT, I took a photo of the view from my office window, asked ChatGPT what it was (which is the Statue of Liberty), and then asked it for directions. And it not only told me how to get the ferry, but gave me advice like “wear comfortable shoes.”\nLEFFER: The directions thing was pretty wild.\nBUSHWICK: It almost seemed like magic, but, of course…\nLEFFER: It’s definitely not. It’s still just the result of lots and lots of training data, fed into a very big and complicated network of computer code. But even though it’s not a magic wand, multimodality is a really significant enough upgrade that might help OpenAI attract and retain users better than it has been. You know, despite all the new stories going around, fewer people have actually been using ChatGPT over the past three months. Usership dropped by about 10% for the first time in June, another 10% in July, and about 3% in August. The prevailing theory is that this has to do with summer break from school—but still losing users is losing users.\nBUSHWICK: That makes sense. And this is also a problem for OpenAI, because it has all this competition. For instance, we have Google, which is keeping its own edge by taking its multimodal AI tool and putting it into a bunch of different products.\nLEFFER: You mean like Gmail? Is Bard going to write all my emails from now on?\nBUSHWICK: I mean, if you want it to. If you have a Gmail account, or even if you use YouTube or Google, if you have files stored in Google Drive, you can opt in and give Bard access to this individual account data. And then you can ask it to do things with that data, like find a specific video, summarize text from your emails, it can even offer specific location-based information. Basically, Google seems to be making Bard into an all-in-one digital assistant.\nLEFFER: Digital assistant? That sounds kind of familiar. Is that at all related to the virtual chatbot pals that Meta is rolling out? \nBUSHWICK: Sort of! Meta just announced it’s not introducing just one AI assistant, it’s introducing all these different AI personalities that you’re supposedly going to be able to interact with in Instagram or WhatsApp or its other products. The idea is it’s got one main AI assistant you can use, but you can also choose to interact with an AI that looks like Snoop Dogg and is supposedly modeled off specific personalities. You can also interact with an AI that has specialized function, like a travel agent.\nLEFFER: When you're listing all of these different versions of an AI avatar you can interact with, the only thing my mind goes to is Clippy from the old school Microsoft Word. Is that basically what this is?\nBUSHWICK: Sort of. You can have, like, a Mr. Beast Clippy, where when you're talking with it, it does – you know how Clippy kind of bounced and changed shape – these images of the avatars will sort of move as if they're actually participating in the conversation with you. I haven't gotten to try this out myself yet, but it does sound pretty freaky.\nLEFFER: Okay, so we've got Mr. Beat, we've got Snoop Dogg. Anyone else?\nBUSHWICK: Let's see, Paris Hilton comes to mind. And there's a whole slew of these. And I'm kind of interested to see whether people actually choose to interact with their favorite celebrity version or whether they choose the less anthropomorphized versions.\nLEFFER: So these celebrity avatars, or whichever form you're going to be interacting with Meta’s AI in, is it also going to be able to access my Meta account data? I mean, there's like so much concern out there already about privacy and large language models. If there's a risk that these tools could regurgitate sensitive information from their training data or user interactions, why would I let Bard go through my emails or Meta read my Instagram DMs.\nBUSHWICK: Privacy policies depend on the company. According to Google, it’s taken steps to ensure privacy for users who opt into the new integration feature. These steps include not training future versions of Bard on content from user emails or Google Docs, not allowing human reviewers to access users’ personal content, not selling the information to advertisers, and not storing all this data for long periods of time. \nLEFFER: Ok, but what about Meta and its celebrity AI avatars?\nBUSHWICK: Meta has said that, for now, it won’t use user content to train future versions of its AI…but that might be coming soon. So, privacy is still definitely a concern, and it goes beyond these companies. I mean, literal minutes before we started recording, we read the news that Amazon has announced it’s training a large language model on data that’s is going to include conversations recorded by Alexa.\nLEFFER: So conversations that people have in their homes with their Alexa assistant.\nBUSHWICK: Exactly. \nLEFFER: That sounds so scary to me. I mean, in my mind, that's exactly what people have been afraid of with these home assistants for a long time, that they'd be listening, recording, and transmitting that data to somewhere that the person using it no longer has control over.\n\n\nBUSHWICK: Yeah, anytime you let another service access information about you, you are opening up a new potential portal for leaks, and also for hacks.\nLEFFER: It's completely unsettling. I mean, do you think that the benefits of any of these AIs outweigh the risks?\nBUSHWICK: So, it's really hard to say right now. Google's AI integration, multimodal chat bots, and, I mean, just these large language models in general, they are all still in such early experimental stages of development. I mean, they still make a lot of mistakes, and they don't quite measure up to more specialized tools that have been around for longer. But they can do a whole lot all in one place, which is super convenient, and that can be a big draw.\nLEFFER: Right, so they’re definitely still not perfect, and one of those imperfections: they’re still prone to hallucinating incorrect information, correct?\nBUSHWICK: Yes, and that brings me to one last question about AI before we wrap up: Do eggs melt?\nLEFFER: Well, according to an AI-generated search result gone viral last week, they do. \nBUSHWICK: Oh, no.\nLEFFER: Yeah, a screenshot posted on social media showed Google displaying a top search snippet that claimed, “an egg can be melted,” and then it went on to give instructions on how you might melt an egg. Turns out, that snippet came from a Quora answer generated by ChatGPT and boosted by Google’s search algorithm. It’s more of that AI inaccuracy in action, exacerbated by search engine optimization—though at least this time around it was pretty funny, and not outright harmful.\nBUSHWICK: But Google and Microsoft – they’re both working to incorporate AI-generated content into their search engines. But this melted egg misinformation struck me because it’s such a perfect example of why people are worried about that happening.\nLEFFER: Mmm…I think you mean eggs-ample.\nBUSHWICK: Egg-zactly.\n[Clip: Show theme music]\nScience Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose, Kelso Harper and Carin Leong.

{"title": "The Assumptions You Bring into Conversation with an AI Bot Influence What It Says", "date": "2023-10-02 15:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA new study reveals an “AI placebo effect”: the same chatbot will respond differently depending on its users’ assumptions about artificial intelligence\nDo you think artificial intelligence will change our lives for the better or threaten the existence of humanity? Consider carefully—your position on this may influence how generative AI programs such as ChatGPT respond to you, prompting them to deliver results that align with your expectations.\n“AI is a mirror,” says Pat Pataranutaporn, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab and co-author of a new study that exposes how user bias drives AI interactions. In it, researchers found that the way a user is “primed” for an AI experience consistently impacts the results. Experiment subjects who expected a “caring” AI reported having a more positive interaction, while those who presumed the bot to have bad intentions recounted experiencing negativity—even though all participants were using the same program.\n“We wanted to quantify the effect of AI placebo, basically,” Pataranutaporn says. “We wanted to see what happened if you have a certain imagination of AI: How would that manifest in your interaction?” He and his colleagues hypothesized that AI reacts with a feedback loop: if you believe an AI will act a certain way, it will.\nTo test this idea, the researchers divided 300 participants into three groups and asked each person to interact with an AI program and assess its ability to deliver mental health support. Before starting, those in the first group were told the AI they would be using had no motives—it was just a run-of-the-mill text completion program. The second set of participants were told their AI was trained to have empathy. The third group was warned that the AI in question was manipulative and that it would act nice merely to sell a service. But in reality, all three groups encountered an identical program. After chatting with the bot for one 10- to 30-minute session, the participants were asked to evaluate whether it was an effective mental health companion.\nThe results suggest that the participants’ preconceived ideas affected the chatbot’s output. In all three groups, the majority of users reported a neutral, positive or negative experience in line with the expectations the researchers had planted. “When people think that the AI is caring, they become more positive toward it,” Pataranutaporn explains. “This creates a positive reinforcement feedback loop where, at the end, the AI becomes much more positive, compared to the control condition. And when people believe that the AI was manipulative, they become more negative toward the AI—and it makes the AI become more negative toward the person as well.”\nThis impact was absent, however, in a simple rule-based chatbot, as opposed to a more complex one that used generative AI. While half the study participants interacted with a chatbot that used GPT-3, the other half used the more primitive chatbot ELIZA, which does not rely on machine learning to generate its responses. The expectation effect was seen with the former bot but not the latter one. This suggests that the more complex the AI, the more reflective the mirror that it holds up to humans.\nThe study intimates that AI aims to give people what they want—whatever that happens to be. As Pataranutaporn puts it, “A lot of this actually happens in our head.” His team’s work was published in Nature on Monday.\nAccording to Nina Beguš, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the upcoming book Artificial Humanities: A Fictional Perspective on Language in AI, who was not involved in the M.I.T. Media Lab paper, it is “a good first step. Having these kinds of studies, and further studies about how people will interact under certain priming, is crucial.”\nBoth Beguš and Pataranutaporn worry about how human presuppositions about AI—derived largely from popular media such as the films Her and Ex Machina, as well as classic stories such as the myth of Pygmalion—will shape our future interactions with it. Beguš’s book examines how literature across history has primed our expectations regarding AI.\n“The way we build them right now is: they are mirroring you,” she says. “They adjust to you.” In order to shift attitudes toward AI, Beguš suggests that art containing more accurate depictions of the technology is necessary. “We should create a culture around it,” she says.\n“What we think about AI came from what we see in Star Wars or Blade Runner or Ex Machina,” Pataranutaporn says. “This ‘collective imagination’ of what AI could be, or should be, has been around. Right now, when we create a new AI system, we’re still drawing from that same source of inspiration.”\nThat collective imagination can change over time, and it can also vary depending on where people grew up. “AI will have different flavors in different cultures,” Beguš says. Pataranutaporn has firsthand experience with that. “I grew up with a cartoon, Doraemon, about a cool robot cat who helped a boy who was a loser in ... school,” he says. Because Pataranutaporn was familiar with a positive example of a robot, as opposed to a portrayal of a killing machine, “my mental model of AI was more positive,” he says. “I think in ... Asia people have more of a positive narrative about AI and robots—you see them as this companion or friend.” Knowing how AI “culture” influences AI users can help ensure that the technology delivers desirable outcomes, Pataranutaporn adds. For instance, developers might design a system to seem more positive in order to bolster positive results. Or they could program it to use more straightforward delivery, providing answers like a search engine does and avoiding talking about itself as “I” or “me” in order to limit people from becoming emotionally attached to or overly reliant on the AI.\nThis same knowledge, however, can also make it easier to manipulate AI users. “Different people will try to put out different narratives for different purposes,” Pataranutaporn says. “People in marketing or people who make the product want to shape it a certain way. They want to make it seem more empathetic or trustworthy, even though the inside engine might be super biased or flawed.” He calls for something analogous to a “nutrition label” for AI, which would allow users to see a variety of information—the data on which a particular model was trained, its coding architecture, the biases that have been tested, its potential misuses and its mitigation options—in order to better understand the AI before deciding to trust its output.\n“It’s very hard to eliminate biases,” Beguš says. “Being very careful in what you put out and thinking about potential challenges as you develop your product is the only way.”\n“A lot of conversation on AI bias is on the responses: Does it give biased answers?” Pataranutaporn says. “But when you think of human-AI interaction, it’s not just a one-way street. You need to think about what kind of biases people bring into the system.”\nNick Hilden writes for the likes of the Washington Post, Esquire, Popular Science, National Geographic, the Daily Beast, and more.

{"title": "It's Time to Hear from Social Scientists about UFOs", "date": "2023-10-02 11:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nWhether or not UFOs exist, we need to pay attention to how they are influencing our politics and culture\nUFOs, recently renamed unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), are attracting public attention in the U.S. in a way we haven’t seen for decades. Ex-government officials, prominent politicians, intelligence agencies, major news outlets and civilian scientists are all looking into the prospect of extraterrestrial visitors, making them no longer seem quite so far-fetched.\nEven NASA, once disinclined to take the subject seriously, convened an independent study team to create a road map for future study of sightings.  The team’s final report, which includes this road map, notes there is no evidence pointing to extraterrestrials. However, the questions asked of NASA officials at their recent press conference showed that aliens and cover-ups remain firmly on the minds of many observers.\nNot everyone has welcomed the UFOs’ newfound measure of legitimacy in the meantime, and critics have questioned both the science and the money behind the resurgence.\nBut for all their wrangling, advocates for and against the serious investigation of UAP share something in common: they all focus on the question of whether the phenomenon is something that exists in nature, whether worldly or other-worldly.\nWe don’t conclusively know if UAP physically exist beyond the mundane, but we do know this: UFOs are social facts. Debate about them is transforming our politics and culture—with effects that are largely overlooked.\nSocial scientists should weigh in on UAP, now. It is a task for which they are well equipped. They not only offer effective techniques for assessing social change, but for decades, social scientists have been conducting research on such relevant topics as human-technological systems, behavioral factors in manned space travel, public attitudes toward UFOs, and the psychophysical and cognitive aspects of sightings.\nTo start, there are three pressing issues surrounding UAP that bear serious study and discussion: intelligence, trust and research ethics.\nThe topic of intelligence turns up in multiple contexts in UAP discussions. For instance, regarding classified military knowledge, much of the current debate and legislation revolves around the reliability of UAP information and how it is handled by government agencies. Given national security needs, what appears to be part of a UFO cover-up may also be explained by mundane organizational failures at the Defense Department, administrations hesitant to poke into those failures, an institutional penchant for secrecy, and finally, plain, old, ignorance. Whatever the case, unidentified flying objects represent a challenge to governmental and military authority. This is because the state is expected to have answers to all possible threats. UAP undermine that guarantee since they are, by definition, unknown.\nIn addition, the subject of UFOs often evokes talk of a separate, mysterious intelligence that must somehow be behind the sightings. This has led philosophers, anthropologists and psychologists to speculate about alien minds, and there is much to be learned from that. We need scholars to figure out how to talk to a being with a nonhuman mind. But we should also examine our assumptions in thinking about and doing research on such intelligence.\nSearch for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) projects, for example, often work with culturally limited notions of civilizational evolution rooted in 19th-century ideals of persistent technological and moral progress. As a result, astronomers unknowingly tend to rely on language borrowed from the era of colonial conquest (e.g., space as “frontier”), while also appropriating land formerly belonging to Indigenous populations to set up their installations. Scholars have warned about how easily reason falls into anthropocentrism and cultural bias when dealing with the nonhuman.\nThe UAP debate also has much in common with conversations about the threats of artificial intelligence (AI). Both involve scenarios in which humans may interact with a superior intellect. Aside from the fear of being dominated by an unknown power, the prospect of an alien encounter raises concerns about uncontrollable consequences and crises in our social and political orders.\nIn reality, AI-based methods will allow us to explore such scenarios in detail. In the near future, large language models promise to help generate intellectual positions and communication that are indistinguishable from human ideas. AI could help to simulate how societies and communities might respond to threatening developments such as first contact. And computational methods already offer social scientists ways to explore large language model–based qualitative data; for example, (social) media data and UAP-related government interaction can reveal sentiments and any related patterns that may have eluded us.\nSuch rigor is especially needed because the history of UFOs has been defined by disputes over the trustworthiness of witness testimony and limited forensic data of these unidentified objects. Since the first reports of UFO sightings in 1947, people have continued to debate over the quality of the data, a fact that has been underscored by the most recent report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nIf in earlier times spiritual authorities have judged the credibility of witnesses reporting anomalous events, today the sciences have increasingly assumed this role—one that is being contested. When it comes to truth and trust, contemporary public communication, especially in the U.S., is characterized by a growing suspicion about established experts. Researchers observe a crisis in confidence in traditional scientific and political institutions.\nThat’s troubling.  Yes, questioning authority is admittedly a vital part of a pluralist society. But the spread of unverified “fake news” and conspiracy theories is shown to have corrosive effects on democracy. The circulation of misinformation and disinformation leads people to rely solely on sources confirming their existing beliefs. In the current environment of uncertainty, polarization and suspicion, tangible evidence often gets replaced by symbolic acts of performance to attest to the credibility of claims. This was apparent at the July 26 congressional hearing on UAP, where elected officials suggested an enormous cover-up.\nHow can we move beyond this? To enhance social trust, experts should lay out responsible standards of research. Deciding how UAP are investigated and by whom raises a variety of research ethics questions warranting reflection.\nSETI researchers have already begun weighing the benefits and harms in probing the universe for signs of intelligent life. They have mapped ways to responsibly search for, communicate with and reveal the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. But they warn that our cultural biases likely make us ill-equipped to respond to such revelations. Caution about built-in bias and failure to account for complexity also apply to computational methods working with large amounts of text and language data. Here again, social science has a role to play.\nBarriers to learning are often our own doing. Take the defense and intelligence communities. Both have historically concerned themselves solely with whether UFOs pose a threat to safety. Their default is to frame the UAP matter in terms of security—a view the media often reinforces— thus militarizing the issue. In doing so, they literally classify the matter out of the eye of other policy makers and civilian scientists, as well as the skeptical public.\nPutting UAP in the hands of the private sector, however, hardly guarantees greater transparency or conscientiousness. The UFO phenomenon long ago turned into a commercial enterprise, now hyped by streaming services, podcasts, social media and cable television. Its entertainment value has provided the hook for Enigma Labs to promote an app for mobile phone users to report sightings. This raises serious privacy concerns about what this enigmatic company plans to do with the vast amount of users’ personal data it collects. A February RAND report, for example, called for a nationwide way to report sightings. But balancing privacy of both observers and the observed, while making the data transparent to researchers, poses obvious challenges.\nTalk about UFOs has never been just about UFOs. The social sciences likely won’t tell us whether UAP are from another world. They will, however, help us explore the “what ifs” and reveal what our actions today tell us about ourselves.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nGreg Eghigian is professor of history and bioethics at Penn State University.

{"title": "Scientists behind mRNA COVID Vaccines Win 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine", "date": "2023-10-02 10:52:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nKatalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for mRNA vaccine discoveries that made highly effective COVID vaccines possible\nThis year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine goes to a transformative medical technology that significantly altered the path of the pandemic and saved millions: the mRNA vaccines against COVID. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were jointly awarded the prize for advancements that have changed the field of vaccine development and researchers’ understanding of how messenger RNA (mRNA) interacts with the body’s immune system. \nSpeaking to Scientific American, Weissman describes the rollercoaster of emotions he went through after learning of the news this morning. “I’m going through a series of steps, it started off just incredible enjoyment and surprise,” he says. “And right now I’m pretty much numb.”\nKarikó and Weissman began studying in vitro synthetic mRNA technology in the 1990s, when they worked together at the University of Pennsylvania. The pair’s seminal paper in 2005 described how they were able to successfully deliver modified mRNA into the body and trigger an immune response—the kind that trains the immune system for future viral infections. Over the years, their research with mRNA vaccines solved some of the major issues confronting the technique, such as the inflammatory response by the body that involves the production of harmful cytokines. During the pandemic, this mRNA technology led to the production of highly effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-causing virus, and particularly ones that were adaptable for large-scale rollout. \n“What’s important here I think is that vaccines could be developed so fast,” said Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam, a member of the 2023 Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, at this morning’s announcement. This was “largely due to ... improvements in the technology and this basic discovery.” \nKarikó was born in 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary. In 1989 she became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained until 2013. She was a senior vice president at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals—a major manufacturer of an mRNA COVID vaccine—and is now an external consultant for BioNTech. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and an adjunct professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\nWeissman was born in 1959 in Lexington, Mass. In 1997 he established his research group at the Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation.\n“The award, to me, is really a victory for vaccines and the potential for vaccines to advance health and improve equity,” says Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccinology professor and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \nMany vaccines had been created with weakened or deactivated whole viruses, but in recent decades many researchers have been investigating smaller viral parts, such as viral genetic material: DNA or RNA. When Karikó and Weissman injected the foreign in vitro mRNA into human cells, they found that it created a strong immune reaction that elevated protective antibodies. Subsequent inflammation, as well as enzymes in human blood and cells, would degrade the mRNA, however. Despite these scientific roadblocks, skepticism and difficulties with funding, Karikó and Weissman continued to search for solutions. \n“It was nonstop technical hurdles for 25 years,” Weissman reflects. “We couldn’t get funding, Kati [Karikó] kept getting demoted and pushed out. It was very difficult to do this research, but we saw early on the potential and how important RNA was likely to be. And that kept us going. We never gave up.”\nThe team found a way to modify mRNA to be less inflammatory—replacing uridine, one of its building block molecules, with a similar molecule called pseudouridine. They also developed a more efficient delivery system that used lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA and help it to enter cells for protein production.\n“In the early days of vaccinology, we would take a bacteria, we would take a virus, and we would weaken it, or we would combine it with another antigen. But here this was really a targeted immune system approach, both from the use of the mRNA and the use of the lipid nanoparticle,” Neuzil says. “So, to me, that was quite impressive—that they took an entirely different approach to vaccine delivery.”\nStarting in the early 2000s, Karikó and Weissman conducted several animal trials with mRNA vaccines for a variety of different pathogens such as Zika, influenza and HIV. “In every animal model we looked at, HIV was the only one that didn’t work well,” Weissman says. “Just about every single one of them gave us 100 percent protection.” \nThe research unlocked a new path for possible therapy and vaccine development—one that would prove critical during the COVID pandemic. \nAdapting for a Global Public Health Emergency \nWhen SARS-CoV-2 began to spread worldwide, Weissman and Karikó’s mRNA research quickly became a candidate and basis for vaccines against the virus. The mRNA vaccine approach had several advantages, Weissman explains. Only a sequence of the original pathogen was needed rather than an actual piece or full virus. “There’s no growing a virus and inactivating it. It’s a very simple procedure, and that’s because it’s a simple enzymatic reaction,” Weissman says. “It was two months from the sequence being released to the first patients getting the vaccine.” \nClinical trials, production and rollout of the vaccines greatly expanded, with companies creating hundreds of millions of doses within a year. “Switching over to COVID, it was just a technical thing,” Karikó told Scientific American in a 2021 interview. “It was already ready.” \nThe mRNA COVID vaccines work by injecting the genetic material specifically for SARS-CoV-2’s spike proteins—surface proteins on the virus that allow it to bind to healthy cells. Modified mRNA in the vaccine is taken by cells, which then decode it and produce those spike proteins so that the immune system can better identify and neutralize the real virus in the event of a future infection. \n“We’re coming off the worst pandemic in more than a century, and certainly these vaccines contributed to lives saved and to less morbidity,” says Neuzil, who has also been working on mRNA vaccines for malaria. “I think an adaptation of this technology and mRNA vaccines could really be transformative, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, because of the adaptability and flexibility of the platform.”\nFuture Therapies  \nFor future vaccines, the application can be quite broad, Weissman says. When Karikó first became interested in mRNA research, she wasn’t initially seeking to develop vaccines. “I was making this modification in the RNA because I always wanted to develop it for therapies,” she told Scientific American in 2021. \nWhile the mRNA technology has helped to tackle the COVID pandemic, a tremendous number of people will benefit from the technology, says Niek Sanders, a principal investigator at Ghent University’s Laboratory of Gene Therapy in Belgium. “It can also be used to treat any disease that is due to a malfunctioning protein as it allows patients produce their own therapeutic proteins,” Sanders says. “Nobel Prizes with such a high impact on society are rare and occur only once in 25 or 50 years.”\nWeissman, Karikó and other research groups are already trying to apply the technology to autoimmune diseases, cancers, food and environmental allergies, bacterial diseases and insect-borne diseases. In July Weissman and his colleagues published a paper in Science that showed they could deliver RNA gene-editing machinery directly to bone marrow stem cells. This could be key for treating diseases such as sickle cell anemia, in which stem cells are typically taken from an individual, cultured and treated, and then put back into the body. “Now we can give them an off-the-shelf injection of RNA and cure their disease, and that has applicability to thousands of other bone marrow diseases. And then you can expand that to liver, to lung, to brain, to every other organ therapeutics,” Weissman says. “The potential is just enormous.”\nWeissman hopes that the mRNA treatment will be available to sickle cell anemia patients in a year and a half. He also has many mRNA clinical trials underway, including a phase 1 trial for the disease amyloidosis and vaccine trials for HIV, norovirus and malaria. Wiessman’s team is also planning to start clinical trials soon on a pan-coronavirus mRNA vaccine, which could help prevent future coronavirus epidemics. \n“The future is now,” Weissman says. “These therapeutics are in people right now.”\nLauren J.

{"title": "'AI Anxiety' Is on the Rise--Here's How to Manage It", "date": "2023-10-02 10:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nRapid advances in generative artificial intelligence have prompted big questions about the future of work and even human creativity. Experts have suggestions for how to manage all these unknowns\nIt’s logical for humans to feel anxious about artificial intelligence. After all, the news is constantly reeling off job after job at which the technology seems to outperform us. But humans aren’t yet headed for all-out replacement. And if you do suffer from so-called AI anxiety, there are ways to alleviate your fears and even reframe them into a motivating force for good.\nIn one recent example of generative AI’s achievements, AI programs outscored the average human in tasks requiring originality, as judged by human reviewers. For a study published this month in Scientific Reports, researchers gave 256 online participants 30 seconds to come up with imaginative uses for four commonplace objects: a box, a rope, a pencil and a candle. For example, a box might serve as a cat playhouse, a miniature theater or a time capsule. The researchers then gave the same task to three different large language models. To assess the creativity of these responses, the team used two methods: an automated program that assessed “semantic distance,” or relatedness between words and concepts, and six human reviewers that were trained to rank responses on their originality.\nIn both assessments, the highest-rated human ideas edged out the best of the AI responses—but the middle ground told a different story. The mean AI scores were significantly higher than the mean human scores. For instance, both the automated and human assessments ranked the response “cat playhouse” as less creative than a similar AI-generated response from GPT-4, “cat amusement park.” And people graded the lowest-scoring human answers as far less creative than the worst of the AI generations.\nHeadlines ensued, proclaiming that “AI chatbots already surpass average human in creativity” and “AI is already more creative than YOU.” The new study is the latest in a growing body of research that seems to portend generative AI outpacing the average human in many artistic and analytical realms—from photography competitions to scientific hypotheses.\nIt’s news such as this that has fed Kat Lyons’s fears about AI. Lyons is a Los Angeles–based background artist who works in animation and creates immersive settings for TV shows including Futurama and Disenchantment. In many ways, it’s their dream job—a paid outlet for their passion and skill in visual art, which they’ve been cultivating since age four. But some aspects of the dream have begun to sour: the rise of visual generative AI tools such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (and the entertainment industry’s eagerness to use them) has left Lyons discouraged, frustrated and anxious about their future in animation—and about artistic work in general. For instance, they were disheartened when Marvel and Disney decided to use an AI-generated, animated intro sequence made by the visual effects company Method Studios for the show Secret Invasion, which premiered in June. “It feels really scary,” Lyons says. “I honestly hate it.” Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, and Method Studios did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLike many professional creatives, Lyons now worries about AI models—which need to train themselves on vast swaths of Internet content—stealing and rehashing their artistic work for others’ profit. And then there’s the corresponding loss of employment opportunities. More broadly, Lyons fears for the future of art itself in an era when honing a craft and a personal voice are no longer prerequisites for producing seemingly original and appealing projects. “I worked so hard for my artistic dreams. I’ve been drawing since I was in preschool,” they say. “This is always what I’ve wanted to do, but we might be entering a world where I have to give that up as my full-time job—where I have to go back to waiting tables or serving coffee.”\nLyons isn’t alone. Many people have found themselves newly anxious about the rapid rise of generative AI, says Mary Alvord, a practicing psychologist in the Washington, D.C., area. Alvord says her clients of all ages express concerns about artificial intelligence. Specific worries include a lack of protection for online data privacy, the prospect of job loss, the opportunity for students to cheat and even the possibility of overall human obsolescence. AI’s advance has triggered a vague but pervasive sense of general public unease, and for some individuals, it has become a significant source of stress.\nAs with any anxiety, it’s important to manage the emotion and avoid becoming overwhelmed. “A certain amount of anxiety helps motivate, but then too much anxiety paralyzes,” Alvord says. “There’s a balance to strike.” Here’s how some psychologists and other experts suggest tackling our AI fears.\nFirst off, context is key, says Sanae Okamoto, a psychologist and behavioral scientist at the United Nations University–Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology in the Netherlands. She suggests keeping in mind that the present moment is far from the first time people have feared the rise of an unfamiliar technology. “Computer anxiety” and “technostress” date back decades, Okamoto notes. Before that, there was rampant worry over industrial automation. Past technological advances have led to big societal and economic shifts. Some fears materialized, and some jobs did disappear, but many of the worst sci-fi predictions did not come true.\n“It’s natural and historical that we are afraid of any new technology,” says Jerri Lynn Hogg, a media psychologist and former president of the American Psychological Association’s Society for Media Psychology and Technology. But understanding the benefits of a new tech, learning how it works and getting training in how to use it productively can help—and that means going beyond the headlines.\nSimone Grassini, one of the researchers of the new study and a psychologist at Norway’s University of Bergen, is quick to point out that “performing one specific task that is related to creative behavior doesn’t automatically translate to ‘AI can do creative jobs.’” The current technology is not truly producing new things but rather imitating or simulating what people can do, Grassini says. AI’s “cognitive architecture and our cognitive architecture are substantially different.” In the study, it’s possible the AI won high creativity ratings because its answers simply copied verbatim parts of a human creation contained somewhere in its training set, he explains. The AI was also competing against human volunteers who had no particular motivation to excel at their creative task and had never necessarily completed such an assignment before. Participants were recruited online and paid only about $2.50 for an estimated 13 minutes of work.\nConfronting fears of generative AI by actually trying out the tools, seeing where and how they can be useful, reading up on how they work and understanding their limitations can turn the tech from a boogeyman into a potential asset, Hogg says. A deeper understanding can empower someone to advocate for meaningful job protections or policies that rein in potential downsides.\nAlvord also emphasizes the importance of addressing the problem directly. “We talk about what actions you can take instead of sticking your head in the sand,” she says. Maybe that means gaining new skills to prepare for a career change or learning about ongoing efforts to regulate AI. Or maybe it means building a coalition with colleagues at work. Lyons says being involved with their union, the Animation Guild, has been crucial to helping them feel more secure and hopeful about the future. In this way, remedies for AI anxiety may be akin to ones for another major, burgeoning societal fear: climate anxiety.\n\r\nThough there are obvious differences between the two phenomena (AI clearly offers some significant possible benefits), there are also apparent similarities. In tackling the biggest concerns about AI and in confronting the climate crisis, “we’re all in this challenge together,” Okamoto says. Just as with climate activism, she explains, meaningfully confronting fears over AI might begin with building solidarity, finding community and coming up with collective solutions.\nAnother way to feel better about AI is to avoid overly fixating on it, Okamoto adds. There is more to life than algorithms and screens. Taking breaks from technology to reconnect with nature or loved ones in the physical world is critical for mental health, she notes. Stepping away from tech can also provide a reminder of all the ways that humans are distinct from the chatbots or image generators that might threaten a person’s career or self-image. Humans, unlike AI, can experience the world directly and connect with one another about it.\nWhen people create something, it’s often in response to their environment. Each word or brushstroke can carry meaning. For Lyons, human creativity is a “feral, primitive drive to make something because you can’t not make it.” So far, all AI can do is mimic that ability and creative motivation, says Sean Kelly, a Harvard University philosophy professor who has been examining the relationship between human creativity and AI for years. When an AI model generates something, Kelly says, “it’s not doing what the original artist did, which was trying to say something that they felt needed to be said.”\nTo Kelly, the real societal fear shouldn’t be that AI will get better or produce ever more interesting content. Instead he’s afraid “that we’ll give up on ourselves” and “just become satisfied” with what AI generators can provide.\nPerhaps the better, and more characteristically human, response is to use our AI anxiety to propel us forward. Mastering a craft—be it drawing, writing, programming, translating, playing an instrument or composing mathematical proofs—and using that skill to create something new is “the most rewarding thing that we can possibly do,” Kelly says. So why not let AI motivate more creation instead of replace it? If the technology spits out something compelling, we can build on it. And if it doesn’t, then why worry about it at all?\nLauren Leffer is a tech reporting fellow at Scientific American. Previously, she has covered environmental issues, science and health.

As clinical trials for these and other psychedelics gain momentum worldwide, Australia could be a model for governments considering regulation of these substances as medications.\nA 125-million-year-old fossil of a badgerlike animal biting a beaked dinosaur was unearthed in northeastern China. Most paleontologists thought mammals only scavenged dinosaur remains, but the find suggests early mammals hunted live dinosaurs several times their size.\nA mile-thick ice sheet in Greenland melted during a period of moderate warming 416,000 years ago, sediments show. This overturns long-held beliefs that the island remained an icy fortress for the past 2.5 million years, revealing its vulnerability to today's human-induced climate change.\nConstruction has begun on a 35-megawatt geothermal power project in Menengai, Kenya, the top geothermal-energy-producing country in Africa.

{"title": "Readers Respond to the May 2023 Issue", "date": "2023-10-01 13:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nLetters to the editors for the May 2023 issue of Scientific American\nI teared up after reading “Designing Life,” in which Philip Ball exquisitely describes how the undifferentiated cells of the early embryo create differentiated tissues, organs and a body, using a genome that does not contain design-plan instructions. The interplay of chemical, physical and electrical signals in the cells and their cooperative response are astounding.\r\nWENDY ROSENBLUM STAMFORD, CONN.\nAs I read of the multiplicity of projects experimenting with living tissues in Ball's article, I realized that this is the complementary situation to that of engineers “playing around” with artificial intelligence. Both groups have little idea of what will emerge from their activities and how it will affect the rest of us.\r\nARNOLD BANNER VIA E-MAIL\n“Witch Hunts,” by Silvia Federici and Alice Markham-Cantor, is a brilliant history of this horrifying and continuing assault against mostly women that often accompanies economic upheaval. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn the national right to an abortion has released what amounts to another contemporary “witch hunt” that targets women who seek this procedure and the medical practitioners who perform it. In many states, these women and professionals are subject to arrest and, for the latter, disbarment from their medical profession. Women travel to other states for an abortion, and those who help them are also subject to arrest.\nI wish the authors had included this present outrage in their article. Considering the current amount of gun violence, I suspect this country will soon see more murders of women who want to or do have an abortion and of professionals who perform the procedure.\r\nJIM BOTTA DELMAR, N.Y.\nSome of the causative factors at play in centuries of accusations of female witchcraft include economic hardship and dislocation, the need for an alien scapegoat, or “other,” and a strongly patriarchal social structure. While I was reading Federici and Markham-Cantor's analysis, it occurred to me that these factors may have further contemporary analogues in such accusations as “pizzagate,” the conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democrats operated a secret child-sex-trafficking ring.\nMost of the triggers for this kind of charge appear to be present in pizzagate: There is widespread conspiratorial rumormongering. There are threatened white males, who are often economically marginalized and facing alleged “replacement” by nonwhite people, as well as demotion from favored patriarchal hegemony by feminism and increased influence of women in politics and business. And there is even a quasireligious element with the false claim that Clinton and her acolytes performed “Satanism.”\nI think that many similar modern indictments of what amounts to female witchcraft could easily be found.\r\nGERALD A. DONALDSON SOUTHPORT, N.C.\n“Social Security and Science,” by Naomi Oreskes [Observatory], asserts that “Social Security isn't a drain on the federal budget; it pays for itself through a dedicated payroll tax.” The article is in error. Social Security tax receipts are already less than payments. The last Social Security Trustees report shows that demographics will cause growing problems. Lower birthrates mean there are fewer and fewer taxpayers for each recipient. There were 4.1 taxpayers per recipient in 1963, but there are only 2.7 now and expectations of just 2.3 by 2035.\r\nROBERT RAY IRVINE, CALIF.\nPoliticians can lie by speaking the truth in a way that misleads. They've told us Social Security (SS) benefits will need to be cut by 2034 because the SS trust funds will reach a dangerous low. They claim it's a difficult problem.\nIf nothing changes in the SS program, its reserves will be depleted by 2034. But raising the annual wage-base increase by a small amount would fix that. Who benefits by not solving this problem? People earning much more than the SS wage cap.\r\nEMANUEL V. POLIZZI MACUNGIE, PA.\nORESKES REPLIES: In my column, I did not say that all was well with the U.S. Social Security system. As several letter writers noted, demographic changes demand adjustments to the system. My point was that the required changes are not dramatic, but some people are exaggerating them because their antigovernment ideology leads them to look for an excuse to dismantle an extremely effective program.\nRay is right that the numbers look large, and when taken out of context, they are frightening. But as any modeler or manager can tell you, in large systems, small changes can have large effects, especially over time. As Polizzi notes, the looming shortfall could be fixed with a small change in the wage base—the level at which workers stop paying Social Security tax on their income.\nThis last point highlights an odd feature of the system. Most of our taxes keep increasing as our income increases. But with Social Security, payments top out at a certain amount. Right now that level is $160,200. According to a 2016 Wall Street Journal analysis, if you earned $161,413 in 2014, that would put you in the top 3 percent that year. Raising the wage base would not only close the shortfall but also make the system more equitable: currently anyone making more than $160,200 a year pays less of their income, as a percentage, in payroll taxes than someone making less than that. Another option would be to raise the retirement age, something that has been done once and could be done again.\nI was delighted to read “Let's Take the Bus,” Kendra Pierre-Louis's article supporting public transport as a way to help solve the climate crisis. I vacation every summer in a remote region of Italy called Val Pusteria. Moving around there used to be a nightmare until I substituted my rental car for the increasingly efficient local transport system that seamlessly coordinates the arrivals and departures of trains and buses down to the smallest of towns. It even connects to skiing venues accessible only through gondolas. Whether the U.S. can similarly deliver the punctuality, efficiency, cleanliness and safety of this region's transport system remains to be seen.\r\nIRA SOHN NEW YORK CITY\n“Parrot Invasions,” by Ryan F. Mandelbaum [July/August], introduced the Carolina Parakeet by saying that “North America once had its own parrot.” This extinct species was specifically native to the eastern U.S.\n“Urine Luck,” by Elise Cutts [Advances; April], misspelled the family name of archaeologist Justin Pargeter.\n“Science in Images,” by Jordan Kinard [Advances; July/August], should have described the FlyLight initiative researchers as at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's (HHMI's) Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va., not HHMI in New York.\nThis article was originally published with the title \"Letters\" in Scientific American  329, 3, 6-7 (October 2023)\ndoi:10.1038/scientificamerican1023-6\nTyler Carroll\nDaniel Garisto\nShannon Hall and Nature magazine\nAvery Ellfeldt and E&E News\nTanya Lewis\nSophie Bushwick and Lauren Leffer\nDiscover world-changing science.

This fact emerges from studies in which short radio waves were reflected from the solid surface and were analyzed by computer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It shows an area 910 miles across near the equator, where there are a dozen large craters ranging from 21 miles in diameter to 100 miles. Smaller craters may well be present but were not resolved. All the craters are shallow—a clue to Venus' history. They could be the result of meteorite impacts before the planet had an atmosphere. Possibly they were subsequently filled with lava from the interior or erosion on the surface.”\nEarth: Alien Zoo or Petri Dish?\n“The probability is high that humans are not one of the most advanced organisms in the universe. There might be civilizations millions of years ahead of our own. If ‘they’ are out there, why have we not heard from them? John A. Ball, in Icarus: International Journal of Solar System Studies, suggests that extraterrestrial civilizations could communicate with us, but they choose not to. ‘Occasionally,’ he observes, ‘we set aside wilderness areas, wildlife sanctuaries, or zoos in which other species are allowed to develop naturally.’ An extraterrestrial species, he speculates, might consider humans an organism to be preserved in isolation and purity, a part of nature to be observed. ‘They have set aside the area in which we live as a zoo.’ F.H.C. Crick and L. E. Orgel, also writing in Icarus, offer an alternative theory: that life on the earth began as a deliberate ‘infection’ of microorganisms placed here by another civilization. Such a civilization would have regarded the earth not as a zoo but as a Petri dish.”\nSunburned Eyes\n“The huge arc lamps used in the moving-picture studio, just like the sun, give out ultra-violet as well as visible light. Hands and face get quickly accustomed to this, and immune to further burning. But the eyeball is very sensitive to burning, and it does not acquire immunity. The burning is a form of conjunctivitis. It is curable, but during the cure the patient must not be further exposed, and the eye is weakened by having been afflicted. This malady appears so freely among motion-picture actors that a name, ‘Kleig eyes,’ has been coined for it [after the Kleig light, a carbon arc-lamp]. It appears that the solution lies in a film that would work as effectively and as fast in a subdued light as the present films work in the glare.”\nCoast to Coast in 27 Hours\n“Lieutenants John A. Macready and Oakley G. Kelly of the Army Air Service, leaving Roosevelt Field on Long Island, reached Rockwell Field in San Diego after a nonstop flight of 26 hours 50 minutes. According to the pilots the average speed was 93.5 miles per hour. In the initial stages the plane was greatly overloaded [with fuel], and an altitude of only 1,500 feet could be maintained. From Indianapolis to Tucumcari in New Mexico they flew [in the dark] by compass alone. One hundred thousand people welcomed the pilots at San Diego. The pilots came down in perfect condition, although neither had slept the entire trip. They state they would have welcomed signs marking towns and other landmarks, particularly by night.”\nOil by Pipeline\n“Transporting oil by pipes has been in practice in the oil districts of Pennsylvania for several years. It remains to be determined whether the project can be carried out on a gigantic scale. With the discoveries in Butler County, Pa., the idea of transporting oil through iron pipes, from Titusville over the Alleghenies to Philadelphia, a distance of 260 miles, is now exciting considerable attention. It is proposed to lay a cast iron six-inch pipe, in a bee line, which at one locality will be 3,000 feet above the sea level. Some 23,000 barrels may be delivered every twenty-four hours, at ten cents per barrel.”\nPerpetual Motion For Sale\n“J.W.S. writes to say that he has a perpetual motion [machine] in running order, and he will dispose of it for $2,000,000, but if he has to carry it to Washington, he will ask $5,000,000. The existing financial crisis will, we fear, prevent our correspondent from receiving either of the sums he mentions.”\n\nThis article was originally published with the title \"50, 100 & 150 Years\" in Scientific American  329, 3, 68 (October 2023)\ndoi:10.1038/scientificamerican1023-68\nMark Fischetti is a senior editor at Scientific American.

{"title": "For Health Equity, Location Matters", "date": "2023-10-01 13:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA special package explores problems and solutions to the geography of injustice\nThe air we breathe, the water we drink, the temperature outside—all are influenced by where we live, and each has a distinct effect on our health. Over the past few decades an abundance of research has shown that the environment can have dramatic impacts on health and that those who have the healthiest environments tend to have the most privilege. Conversely, those who bear the brunt of environmental health threats tend to have limited power to bring about real change.\nRobert D. Bullard, known as the father of environmental justice, was one of the first people to systematically document the connection between race and exposure to pollution. His work showed clearly how U.S. policies such as redlining had burdened majority-Black communities with far more contaminated air and water than their white neighbors were exposed to. Because of those same historical policies, people of color on average live in neighborhoods with higher surface heat than do non-Hispanic white people. One result of these urban heat islands is that people who already have a higher risk of respiratory and heart disease end up living in environments that exacerbate those illnesses.\nAround the world, people breathing the most toxic air are consistently the poorest and most disadvantaged. This pattern is apparent at every level, from the smallest towns to the largest countries. Wealthy nations have shown that reducing air pollution saves lives, and some poorer countries are proving that clean energy can fuel economic development.\nSnakebite envenomation is one of the deadliest tropical diseases. Like so many other conditions, it is most dangerous to the people with the fewest resources because they are least able to protect themselves from being bitten or to access the best care. New treatments could save lives and limbs.\nThe climate crisis is changing the range and prevalence of many diseases. Valley fever has expanded into new locations, and those working outdoors in construction sites and dusty agricultural fields are the most at risk. The illness also disproportionately affects Latino, Asian and Indigenous American people, who are more likely to contract it than white people and who often experience more severe symptoms.\nSolutions exist, and they require better understanding and a fresh approach. Innovative researchers are devising healthier buildings, designing clinical trials with community involvement, and monitoring the air and water to empower people to protect themselves. They are creating a movement toward a more livable and more just world.\nThis article is part of “Innovations In: Environmental Health Equity,” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from Takeda Pharmaceuticals. \nLauren Gravitz is a science journalist in San Diego, Calif., who has contributed to Nature, NPR, the Washington Post, MIT Technology Review and the Economist, among other publications.

{"title": "Pipelines Touted as Carbon Capture Solution Spark Uncertainty and Opposition", "date": "2023-10-01 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nFederal investment in carbon capture could help fight climate change, but this technology is facing fierce opposition\nOne hot summer day two years ago, Kathy Stockdale checked her mailbox and found a slip of paper that would change her life. The humble notice revealed that two carbon capture companies wanted to seize part of her family’s farmland in Hardin County, Iowa, for a pair of pipelines slated to pass through it. But Stockdale wasn’t going to give up her property without a fight.\nPipelines are hardly new to the Midwest; thousands of miles of natural gas conduits already crisscross the region. But fresh tension surrounds the construction of a relatively new kind of conduit called a carbon capture pipeline, and the Stockdales’ land lies in the potential pathway of two of them. These pipelines are part of an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ethanol production plants by capturing and storing carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. But despite the green intentions behind the technology, environmentalists are actually joining landowners in pushing back against it. Many experts worry the pipelines could spring deadly leaks or contaminate water—and they question how effective such projects will actually be at fighting climate change.\nStockdale and her husband, Raymond, who have lived on their farm for 47 years, were stunned when representatives from a carbon capture company suddenly showed up just three months after the couple received the notice. Without asking permission, the reps began planting stakes where the pipe would go, Stockdale says. “I have never felt more disrespect in my life,” she adds. She decided to fight back against the use of eminent domain—a legal concept that allows companies to seize private property for public use through the local, state or federal government (although the landowner must be fairly compensated). Stockdale has been fervently attending public hearings on permits, researching pipeline safety and talking with legislators. She has had a lot of sleepless nights. And even though she says she isn’t interested in environmental protection, she has partnered with the local Sierra Club chapter for support.\nEnvironmentalists might not seem like a natural ally in a battle against green technology, but they have concerns about the growing U.S. web of carbon capture pipelines—which currently includes more than 5,300 miles of conduit. And carbon capture technology continues to gain traction nationwide; the Biden administration recently announced that it would spend up to $1.2 billion on carbon capture and storage projects, signaling a commitment to this technology as a means to achieve net zero emissions.\nHere’s how the carbon capture process works: It begins at an industrial site, such as an ethanol or power plant, that produces a lot of carbon dioxide emissions. As the plant burns fossil fuels, a liquid solvent absorbs the exhaust and separates its gases. A storage chamber collects separated carbon dioxide (which would otherwise enter the atmosphere and trap heat), and harmless nitrogen and oxygen are released. Next, the system liquifies the CO2, which flows through steel pipelines to a designated storage site. Once it arrives, another pipe injects it deep underground, where it is isolated from the atmosphere and will no longer actively contribute to climate change.\nBut the process comes with risks.\nCO2 remains a liquid in the high-pressure, high-temperature environment inside a pipeline. But if the pipeline ruptures, that liquid escapes as a colorless, odorless gas that is difficult for people to detect without specialized instruments. This CO2 can displace oxygen and potentially cause suffocation, drowsiness and sometimes death; in fact, the gas is sometimes pumped into specialized chambers to euthanize livestock on farms. In 2020 heavy rains triggered a landslide that damaged a carbon capture pipeline in Satartia, Miss. The pipe burst and released CO2, suffocating 45 people so severely that they needed to be hospitalized.\nFortunately, these pipelines have a low probability of failure. Leaks are few and far between. But Bill Caram, executive director of Pipeline Safety Trust, says that any one rupture can have unacceptable consequences. “We have a goal of zero incidents. And I think that’s a shared goal among regulators and the industry,” Caram says. “We’re a long way away from that happening.”\nA study released in May found that carbon capture pipelines are more likely to experience small punctures than large ruptures such as the one in Satartia. Smaller holes release the gas at a slower rate, which makes them harder to locate. And a delayed response to smaller punctures could cause them to be deadly.\nWhen CO2 vaporizes and escapes, it causes the temperature in the pipeline to drop immediately—a process Caram describes as “violent.” The escaped gas doesn’t ignite or dissipate. It moves quickly along the ground and can collect in low-lying areas, including small valleys and basements near the pipeline route. If a person in one of these pockets breathes air with a 10 percent concentration of CO2, they can fall unconscious within one minute.\nAdditionally, impurities in the liquified gas can erode a pipeline and increase the chance of a leak. Potentially dangerous contaminants include water, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides—all of which are sometimes found in CO2 captured from power plants. There is only limited research on how these contaminants will affect the gas’s stability in storage. Experts note that relatively large concentrations of oxygen could potentially dissolve caprock, a natural geological formation that traps oil and coal—and injected CO2—and keeps them from escaping to the surface. One of the main problems, Caram says, is that there are no federal regulations from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration about limiting impurities, even after the 2020 Satartia incident. “Operators can clean it up somewhat. They can dry it out and get the water out of there to a certain extent,” Caram says. “But there’s no regulation saying that the pipeline can’t have these impurities in it. It’s just kind of up to operators to do it.”\nBeyond their safety concerns, experts question whether carbon capture and storage is even an effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gases. Noah Planavsky, an isotope geochemist at Yale University’s Center for Natural Carbon Capture, says the practice would certainly reduce the CO2 in the air—but the overall situation is not that simple. “It’s not whether or not it’ll remove carbon. It will remove carbon,” Planavsky says. “But are we doing things that are actually propagating further use of fossil fuels?”\nInvesting massive amounts of money in carbon capture and storage, and the pipelines that come with it, will lower carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. But with limited federal money allocated for long-term climate change mitigation, Planavsky is not sure this technology is the best use of those funds. He says it’s important to consider whether carbon capture will be used as an excuse for not phasing out fossil fuels.\nCarbon dioxide removal, Planavsky explains, is not meant to replace emissions reduction. Instead meeting the goal of producing net-zero CO2 emissions will require a range of solutions, including both industrial and natural carbon capture. The latter could mean preserving natural spaces such as forests, oceans, grasslands and wetlands, which naturally pull carbon dioxide from the air. Natural forms of carbon capture provide cleaner water and air, as well as increased biodiversity—things that might serve the land, rather than put holes in it.\nBut as more federal money goes into carbon capture pipelines and other projects, public permit hearings such as those happening in the Midwest will continue. The situation is keeping landowners, experts and locals on their toes. And until the carbon capture companies are denied building permits in Iowa, Stockdale says she will continue fighting to keep the pipelines off her land.\n“It’s not what I planned on doing at 72 years old. I have five grandkids who I can spend more time with,” Stockdale says. “But I’m fighting for their futures.”\nAnna Mattson is a freelance science journalist based in South Dakota.

{"title": "Why Do We Forget So Many of Our Dreams?", "date": "2023-09-30 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nWe only remember a fraction of our dreams, and even those slip away if we don’t try to remember them—here’s why\nIf you’ve ever awoken from a vivid dream only to find that you can’t remember the details by the end of breakfast, you’re not alone. People forget most of the dreams they have—though it is possible to train yourself to remember more of them.\nDreaming happens mostly (though not always exclusively) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During this sleep stage, brain activity looks similar to that in a waking brain, with some very important differences. Key among them: during REM sleep, the areas of the brain that transfer memories into long-term storage—as well as the long-term storage areas themselves—are relatively deactivated, says Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of the book The Committee of Sleep (Oneiroi Press, 2001). This may be a side effect of REM’s role in memory consolidation, according to a 2019 study on mice in the journal Science.\nShort-term memory areas are active during REM sleep, but those only hang on to memories for about 30 seconds.\n“You have to wake up from REM sleep, generally, to recall a dream,” Barrett says. If, instead, you pass into the next stage of sleep without rousing, that dream will never enter long-term memory.\nREM sleep occurs about every 90 minutes, and it lengthens as the night drags on. The first REM cycle of the night is typically just a few minutes long, but by the end of an eight-hour night of sleep, a person has typically been in the REM stage for a good 20 minutes, Barrett says. That’s why the strongest correlation between any life circumstance and your memory of dreams is the number of hours you’ve slept. If you sleep only six hours, you’re getting less than half of the dream time of an eight-hour night, she says. Those final hours of sleep are the most important for dreaming. And people tend to remember the last dream of the night—the one just before waking.\nOther factors also contribute to whether you’ll remember your fantastic nighttime adventures, Barrett says. Women tend to remember a few more dreams than men, on average, according to a 2008 meta-analysis of multiple dream studies. Young people remember more dreams than older people, multiple studies have shown. Memory of dreams increases in kids from the age at which they can communicate about those dreams, , plateaus from the early teens to the early 20s and then very gradually declines in adults over the rest of their life span, Barrett says.\nThere is a lot of individual difference in dream memory, though. Some people almost never remember a dream, and others regularly recall several each night. People who are more introverted and inward-focused tend to remember more dreams, Barrett says, while those who are more extroverted and action-oriented tend to remember fewer. Imaginativeness and susceptibility to hypnosis are also linked to dream recall, as are some measures of creativity, she says, though creativity is tricky because not all measures of creativity even line up with one another, much less with dream tendencies. Overall, according to one 2017 study, recall of and interest in dreams seems tied to openness to experience, a personality trait characterized by a desire to try new things and explore unusual ideas.\nA few studies that have investigated lucid dreaming –vivid dreams the dreamer remembers very well and feels in control of --  suggest that some areas of the brain linked to attention are more active in people who recall more dreams, indicating that basic neurological differences may play a role.\n“Some people don’t pay as much attention to their dreams while they’re happening as others, just in terms of brain action going on,” Barrett says.\nIt is possible to train your brain to remember more of your dreams, though, says Leslie Ellis, a clinical counselor in British Columbia and author of A Clinician’s Guide to Dream Therapy: Implementing Simple and Effective Dreamwork (Routledge, 2019). She advises clients who want to remember their dreams to take a moment when they wake up, before they even move their body, to think about what they were just dreaming and remember as much as possible. This moves the dream from short-term memory to long-term memory.\n“Write it down right away, and then you’ll have it there,” Ellis says, “because they do slip away unless they’re deliberately recorded, for most people.”\nDreams are often considered nonsensical in Western culture, Ellis says. Though the narratives may not make much sense, they often hint at emotions that people are processing in their waking lives. “We do dream about the things we kind of don’t want to look at,” she says. “During the day, we can repress a lot of that, but the dreams will bring those things to the surface.”\nEven just thinking about dreams more often can bring them more fully into your waking life. Taking a class on dreaming, reading a book about dreaming or even just thinking more about dreaming has a short-term impact on people’s dream recall, Barrett says.\n“Trying to remember your dreams or even just having a lot of context with references to dreams will temporarily increase your dream recall,” she says. “You can do it on purpose.... But it [also] indirectly works if somebody’s been talking to you a ton about dreams or you read an article in a magazine today on dreams.”\nIn other words, if you’ve made it to the end of this article, you may have sweet dreams tonight.\nStephanie Pappas is a freelance science journalist.

{"title": "In War-Torn Ukraine, a Doctor Evacuates Children with Cancer", "date": "2023-09-30 01:00:00", "text": "A pediatric oncologist is racing against time to send scores of sick children out of Ukraine for medical aid.\nRoman Kizyma The first months of war, we didn't have the weekdays, so we just worked seven days, 24 hours.\nThere are moments when I can work for three days without sleep. There are moments like when I, I cannot do anything for this day.\nI had a very long period without my very small kids. And so when I met in a couple of months, my younger son, so he didn't recognize me. So compared to the people that suffered the atrocities in Bucha or European or Eastern Ukraine, this is nothing. But this wasn't a good experience. \nThe main factor for myself is this feeling of responsibility.\n[Roman Kizyma, to camera] So when you see a bald guy or girl in the hospital, that’s my patient. \nIf I just stop, I compromise the treatment of hundreds of children. And I think I'm not in the position to to end this.\n[Roman Kizyma, in Ukrainian to patient] Where is the problem? Where does it hurt? Show me. \n[Patient] Here. \nRoman Kizyma Here? Ok. \n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian, to patient] Do you want to show me your tongue? Ok.\nMy name is Roman Kizyma. I am pediatric oncologist, a medical doctor treating children with cancer. Now I’m the Acting Director of Western Ukrainian Specialized Children's Medical Center, a huge, specialized hospital for severely ill children with cancer with other catastrophic diseases.\nThe war made the things for children with cancer and other catastrophic disease very difficult. You have to fight two wars, one against cancer, the other against the crazy Russian army shooting at you. It's not only the physical unsafety, it's also the complete disruption at some point of medical logistics. So no drugs coming to the hospital. No doctors or nurses available in the direct hospital. The physical unsafety, the shelling of Ukrainian electricity infrastructure.\nSo sometimes we were black. All the hospital was black. No electricity. \n[Hospital staff, in Ukrainain] And our doctor’s don’t know this but \n[Staff] — Oh everyone’s with flashlights. \n[Hospital Staff singing Ukrainian National Anthem] \nRoman Kizyma This is a vulnerable group of patients. And when there is a kind of crisis, vulnerable group of people suffers the most because no one cares. Everyone trying to save themselves. So that's why a lot of families like asked or decided or went by themselves to Europe with this project that we call Safer Ukraine. \nBefore the war, I was just treating cancer. I transformed into someone coordinating the big groups of very sick children going here and there. So it means like one and a half thousand children out of Ukraine with cancer treated somewhere else. The team is ready to help these children and we have the capacity. So that's why this is a special hospital.\nDuring two years before the start of the war, we were creating the new department, the Clinic of Pediatric oncology and stem cell transplant here in this hospital.We opened this seven days before the start of the war, so we had a huge amount of patients going to be treated there. And we have to transform ourselves from oncologists to emergency doctors and relocate all our patients to to to the other countries.\nSo it was a huge blow for our level of work. And we have to abandon all these new structures that we created because you cannot perform transplants when you are getting shellings and shootings and all these children.\n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian] If not urgent then tomorrow, ok? Ok. If urgent I can look now. Ok. \nI feel so stressed. I feel like in a race against time. The relocation of a child with cancer from Ukraine to Western Europe is not something new. We did that even before the war, but was like a couple of children per year. But how do you do that if you have 100 children with cancer coming to your hospital per night.\nThese are severely ill children. And for each of them you should have a lot of medical staff to support each patient.\n[Nurse, in Ukrainian] Alright. \nThere is no hospital that can treat 1,500 children at one time from some country. So this is not possible, \n[Child, in Ukrainian] It’s cold.\nRoman Kizyma That's why we tried to use different criteria. First of all, we organized multistep approach with different hubs.\nWe got the requests from the families or the doctors from different cities of the east of Ukraine or Kyiv, the capital. The first hub is in Lviv. This hospital that can host any child of any severity. And if they cannot go further, we can treat them here for a long time or for a short time and then allocate them.\nWe created with our partners, with charities or the support for housing and the capacity for transportation. So we had a lot of volunteers meeting children in the railway station, carrying them out of there, carrying 20 patients out of a train in a railway station that is packed with people trying to go somewhere. We went only [as] five doctors to meet a huge convoy at the railway station, so we have to carry kids across the railways.\nThe next step was the hub in Poland. The thing was to cross the border was a lot of queues of people trying desperately to move out of Ukraine. So we used the diplomatic power of Polish consulates situated in Lviv. This was saving time for the severely ill kids because if they stayed for ten or 20 hours in the queue, they would not leave it. So it was possible. \nIn the next hub there was a triage of the international team that came here to Poland and they formed a logistics. A huge hotel was transformed into a medical center in the middle of Poland. Children were arriving there and they were triaged to different rooms and taken care by this group of international doctors.\nThen they contacted their dedicated hospital throughout Europe and U.SA and these hospitals and their government, they were transferring these kids to a specific hospital admitted by their team. In the worst phase, we had more than 150 children per week sent by this pathway. This was very hard. \n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian, to patient] You can pull it up a bit. Good. \nRoman Kizyma My job was not to step into one into one case.\nSo this was I was oncologist myself. So I tried just to not to step in each case more than like 10 minutes. So I used my previous experience to triage them. \n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian, to patient.] Good. Can you smile? Can you smile and show your teeth? Good, well done. \nDuring all these relocations, we lost two children. It's Russians who were attacking them, kids were from Kharkiv.\nSo it's very close to the Russian border. That's why during their very severe treatment phase, they had to be evacuated from their hospital, put into ordinary trains and they came to L’viv. Like we literally had no choice. So we had to explain to the families, you decide what you do. You don't go and we stay and try to do something here in L'viv during these air strikes, or you risk.\nBut at least, you know you did everything to a child. So they risked and we failed. So this both children died. Some of their doctors who helped us here, they came from the regions that were under attack. There is a sad story of our colleagues in Kyiv. One of their doctors, she was driving to her shift for the children with cancer.\nShe was hit directly by a Russian rocket in her car and she was burned alive. Her name is Oksana Leontieva. And I think this event, it was very influential. So we realized how dangerous, dangerous the work is. \n[In Ukrainian, singing] Hands made some porridge and gave to Darynka. Running to get some porridge, Yes. \nBut there were a lot of happy situations. And I visited a lot of these hospitals afterwards, like in fall in the winter, that here. And the people were happy. The children were happy. Who are you treating? Sometimes I felt like I was going through a hospital in Europe and like the first room, my patient, the second room, my patient. The third room, my patient.\nSo I was feeling like I'm the part of the staff of that hospital. You were asking me like, What should we do with your patients? So mostly these are the good stories and the feedbacks where like people are very grateful to all these countries because they felt like they were in home. During last year even as a pediatric oncologist, I helped to build the facilities.\nSo I'll try to do that as a director, but not only for pediatric oncology, for example, this will be the intensive care unit, the huge project within this year. So some people like outside of Ukraine, how can you build during the wartime? You can. Why not? The life still goes on and we have to have these places for this severely ill children that will look better.\nSo that's what I am focused now to to do that. This is a network that try to balance itself. So this is a never ending process. I hope this will work.\n[The above is a transcript of this podcast]\nCarin Leong and Kelso Harper\nJonathan Schienberg and Retro Report\nAaron Martin\nDaniel Garisto, Jason Drakeford, Lee Billings and Jeffery DelViscio\nDuy Linh Tu and Sebastian Tuinder\nKit R.

{"title": "New York City's Floods and Torrential Rainfall Explained", "date": "2023-09-29 21:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nRecord-breaking rains caused major flash flooding in New York City, reminiscent of Hurricane Ida and a sign of what climate change will increasingly bring\nPhotographs and videos of New York City have shown rainwater spurting from between subway station tiles, cars bobbing in floodwaters that turned Brooklyn intersections into lakes and parts of LaGuardia Airport inundated as the city and surrounding areas have been deluged by heavy downpours on Friday.\nBetween midnight and the afternoon, rainfall rates up to two inches per hour dropped more than five inches of water on Central Park and more than eight inches on John F. Kennedy International Airport—a record for any calendar day in the latter. That precipitation overwhelmed ground that was already well saturated from the previous weekend’s rains (courtesy of the remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia) and the storm drains and subway pumps used to funnel rainwater away.\nThe rain has been reminiscent of what might happen in a tropical system—and has reminded many New Yorkers of Hurricane Ida’s deadly flooding two years ago—though the exact mechanics were a bit different in this case. Here Scientific American answers some questions readers may have about this and similar events—particularly how climate change comes into play.\nHow does this compare with other major rain events in New York City’s history?\nWe can’t say exactly where this event will rank because the rain is still falling, but comparing it to Ida is not off base. Ida’s peak rainfall rates were higher—about three inches per hour—and it dropped 7.13 inches on September 1, 2021, the worst day of rain during that storm. And though the current storm has caused major flash flooding, “we haven’t seen the catastrophic flash flooding” that happened during Ida and killed 11 people in basement apartments in Queens, says Dominic Ramunni, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Upton, N.Y.\nThis event has dropped more rain than Ida did on JFK Airport, though—it is the most rain the airport has recorded since records began in 1948. Every storm is a little different, and where the heaviest bands of rain form can vary, which means some areas experience higher totals in some storms than in others. “That's why we see this variability from event to event,” Ramunni says.\nHow do you get such a deluge without the involvement of a tropical storm?\nThough tropical cyclones (the broad term for tropical storms, hurricanes and typhoons) are notorious for the torrents of rain they can bring, nontropical systems are capable of causing heavy downpours if they have enough moisture available.\nTropical systems are driven by convection that is fueled by warm ocean waters. They often develop a clear “eye” at their center that is completely surrounded by swirling thunderstorms. That setup has not been present with the system over New York City on Friday.\nRather that system has been driven in part by an area of low pressure to the south of the city that is an offshoot of another, more unusual area of low pressure called an “inverted trough.” In meteorological speak, that means it has caused a northward bulge in the atmosphere instead of a more typical southward one. The whole setup has made moisture-laden air converge and rise upward. As it has risen, the air has cooled and formed clouds and rain. That moisture has been funneled onshore like a hose aimed at the city.\nHow does climate change factor into the situation?\nIt would take a specific study—called an attribution study—to give any hard numbers on how much more likely this event would be with climate change than without it. But broadly speaking, scientists know that rising global temperatures are making heavy downpours more likely.\nThe 2018 National Climate Assessment (a new version of which is due sometime this year) found that the amount of rain that fell during the heaviest 1 percent of rain events had increased by 55 percent across the Northeast since 1958, with most of the increase happening since 1996. That trend will only get worse as global temperature rise, causing more evaporation from oceans and lakes and giving storms more water to fuel deluges.\nHow can I stay more aware of pending storms and flooding threats?\nRamunni says that having more than one source for receiving extreme weather alerts is ideal. These resources can include alerts that government agencies send out to your phone, local news and a weather radio.\nWhen forecasters issue a watch for a flood (or other type of weather event such as a tornado), it indicates that people should be prepared for those conditions in their area. If a warning is issued, that means they should take immediate action.\nIn the case of floods, one of the biggest warnings meteorologists give is to never, ever drive into floodwaters, even if they don't seem very deep. Just six inches of water can reach the bottom of the average passenger car and cause loss of control, and only a foot of water can float many vehicles.\nCould this event have been even worse?\nAmazingly, yes. Meteorologist Mark Bove noted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the highest rains from the storm occurred just offshore and totaled more than 8.5 inches. If that had fallen over the city, it would have been “the worst #flooding disaster the city has ever experienced,” he wrote.\nAndrea Thompson, an associate editor at Scientific American, covers sustainability. Follow Andrea Thompson on Twitter Credit: Nick Higgins\nMeghan Bartels\nThomas Frank and E&E News\nJaney Camp and The Conversation US\nOliver Wing, Carolyn Kousky, Jeremy Porter, Paul Bates and The Conversation US\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Government Shutdown Looms over Scientists", "date": "2023-09-29 21:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA government shutdown would disrupt biomedical research and clinical trials as federal experimental facilities shuttered\nFuelled by infighting among Republicans in the House of Representatives over spending cuts, the United States is barreling towards a government shutdown. Lawmakers in the US Congress have until 30 September (the end of the fiscal year) to reach an agreement over how to keep money flowing to federal agencies, or the government will have to close many of its doors and furlough staff — including tens of thousands of scientists — without pay. Depending on how long the shutdown lasts, work at science agencies will stop, interrupting experiments, delaying the approval of research grants and halting travel to scientific conferences.\nThe shutdown drama is unfolding in the House, where the Republican party holds a narrow majority. A handful of extreme right-wing Republicans are refusing to support a ‘continuing resolution’ to fund the government temporarily while negotiations over a 2024 budget continue — that is, unless Congress agrees to drastically cut government spending, among other demands. Democrats are united in opposition to their requests, and most Republicans in both the House and the Democrat-controlled Senate are looking for compromise that would keep the government open. But time is running out.\nHere Nature takes a look at what’s driving this latest budgetary crisis, and what’s in store for scientists if the US government shuts down next week.\nThis is basically a continuation of the US debt-ceiling crisis, which occurred less than four months ago. At that time, some Republicans threatened to block legislation that would make sure the government had enough money to pay its bills, unless Democrats, including President Joe Biden, agreed to future spending cuts. Congress avoided disaster by reaching a bipartisan agreement to limit federal ‘discretionary’ spending — money that goes to US science and other programmes. The legislation, which broadly outlined reductions in spending over the next two years, was signed by Biden on 3 June.\nSince then, lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have gone about their business with unusual efficiency, making progress on a series of annual bills that outline detailed spending levels for federal agencies. The irony is that lawmakers haven’t made this much progress by the fiscal-year deadline in a long time, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), based in Rockville, Maryland. “And yet here we are, staring down the barrel of another shutdown.”\nNormally, Congress would pass a resolution to continue funding agencies for a couple of months while lawmakers finish up budget negotiations, but the situation is different this year. Republicans hold only a narrow majority in the House, occupying 222 seats, compared with the Democrats’ 213. That means that to pass legislation, the Republican party needs to maintain a united front and vote nearly in unison, to overcome Democratic opposition. Several hardline Republicans are holding out, however, using their leverage to force further concessions on spending.\nThe answer differs from agency to agency. Some agencies have residual funds that they can tap to continue operating in the short term. And to varying degrees, all agencies maintain a skeleton staff of ‘essential’ workers to complete duties related to national security and the protection of public property, for instance.\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF), expects to halt work for 1,487 out of its 1,946 employees, once short-term funding runs out, for example. Scientists can continue to submit applications for funding to the agency, which pays for about one-quarter of the taxpayer-supported basic research in the United States, but no new projects will be approved. The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the US National Institutes of Health, a significant funder of biomedical research, plans to furlough some 37,325 people — 42% of its staff — by the second day of a shutdown. ‘Essential’ staff working at its clinical centre or on public-safety missions such as monitoring for viral outbreaks will continue to report to work.\nGovernment scientists will have access to laboratories for the maintenance of equipment, cell cultures and animals, but research will mostly grind to a halt, says Joanne Carney, chief government-relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC.\nIf the shutdown drags on, she says, it could have knock-on effects for scientists outside of government, who might lose access to federally funded experimental facilities or be forced to delay hiring for projects while awaiting grant decisions. Scientists witnessed such impacts in late 2018 and early 2019, when the US government partially shut down for 35 days.\n“It does create a ripple effect into the research community outside the federal government,” Carney says.\nMichael Moloney, chief executive officer of the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland, says US shutdowns can also impact international collaborations and the country’s reputation abroad. He is attending the International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijan, next week, and fears that scientists from NASA will now have to cancel their attendance. “That may not have any immediate short-term impact, but it does chip away at our reputation as a global player,” he says.\nTo end a shutdown, Congress would need to pass a continuing resolution that enables the government to fund activities for weeks or months while lawmakers finish passing bills locking in the 2024 budget. According to Zeitzer, one natural landing place in terms of budget negotiations is where everything started: with the broad spending limits laid out in the debt-ceiling agreement cemented back in June.\nThe impacts of such a move would vary by agency, but Zeitzer says many agency leaders are probably already preparing for some tough budgetary decisions next year. This is one of those years where no increase — but also no decrease — in funding will be “the good scenario,” she says.\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on September 28, 2023.\nJeff Tollefson works for Nature magazine.\n\nJean Chemnick and E&E News\nThomas Frank and E&E News\nThomas Frank and E&E News\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Government Shutdown Could Delay Climate Action", "date": "2023-09-29 16:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nEPA rules on clean cars, power plants and methane could face delays if there is a federal government shutdown because of budget turmoil in Congress\nCLIMATEWIRE | EPA was already facing a mad dash to complete climate rules in the next six months. A government shutdown could make that harder.\nThe agency has run behind schedule to propose and finalize regulations throughout the Biden administration, and the government's looming closure threatens to make it harder for the agency to complete work on key pieces of the president’s climate agenda before they may become vulnerable to Republican-led reversals.\nThe administration’s regulatory agenda in June projected that the Office of Air and Radiation would clear a slate of methane-related actions over the summer, including a final oil and gas rule and a proposed fee on excess emissions envisioned in last year’s climate law. Neither has begun White House review.\nEPA also expected to finish work on rules for passenger vehicle and heavy-duty truck emissions before the end of this year. While the truck rule is expected to hit that mark, EPA has said the clean car rule won't be ready until the spring. And the agency's marquee rule for power plant carbon emissions is projected to be final in April.\nIf EPA sticks to its current schedule, that should prevent Republicans from using the Congressional Review Act to undo those rules in one fell blow if they win control of both congressional chambers and the White House in next year's elections. But experts say a government shutdown could delay the rulemaking process. The CRA sets a strict window based on the congressional calendar allowing lawmakers to pass — and the president to sign — a resolution to veto a newly minted rule. It's not clear when that window will close next year, but the later the rule is final the more it is at risk.\nIf Congress fails to pass a funding bill by Saturday at midnight, EPA has said it has cash on hand to stay open through Oct. 7. Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said in an email to staff first reported by POLITICO that if Congress still hadn’t passed government funding legislation by next Friday, “most EPA employees” will be furloughed.\nAnd that could cost the agency more productivity than the length of the shutdown would suggest, say former EPA officials.\n“If the shutdown is one week, it's more than one week that they're going to lose on the rulemaking process,” said Bob Perciasepe, a former EPA deputy administrator who has experienced three government shutdowns. “It's already eroding their effectiveness, I'm guessing, right now.\"\nThe looming shutdown also raises the prospects of other interruptions that could grind agency work to a halt. Online portals that are used to submit grant applications and to comment on EPA actions might close, requiring extensions. And outside contractors that EPA relies on for some of its economic modeling and analysis related to rulemakings could take other work.\nExisting laws do allow EPA to carry on with some activities if appropriations lapse. The agency's 2-year-old contingency plan outlines those exceptions — including allowing work to continue if it's related to court-ordered deadlines, securing EPA facilities or protecting “life and property.” The plan points to the example of responding to the release of hazardous substances when it endangers public health.\nCongress enacted climate and infrastructure legislation over the last two years that provides funding outside of the regular appropriations process — and that work can continue during a government shutdown. But money from the Inflation Reduction Act probably can’t be used to continue EPA regulatory work, experts say.\nStan Meiburg, who served at EPA for nearly 40 years including a stint as acting deputy administrator, said rules that are already under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget likely face the thorniest shutdown-related delays.\n“With major rules in particular there'd have been a lot of discussion going on between OMB and EPA before they send the rule over there, and they have it pretty well laid out as to what their schedule is and what they were expecting to do,” he said. “If you can't get it out of OMB, though, you start to get day-to-day extensions of where and when the actual release is going to be.”\nThe EPA air office has a handful of rules currently under White House review, including one that would guide state plans to implement the power plant carbon rule and the oil and gas methane rule. The methane rule is expected to go to OMB any day, observers say.\nEPA released draft methane rules during the last two global climate summits, and the final version might be unveiled at the talks that start in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in November. But interagency review typically takes at least two months, so a government shutdown of any length would make that timing unlikely.\nMeiburg said a shutdown that causes short-term delays for some rules would be unlikely to create a long-term backup that could affect the clean car and power plant rules expected in the spring.\n\"Usually the agency can do a certain amount of scrambling around to just kind of make up some time,” he said. OMB might also work to complete reviews more quickly.\nReporter Kevin Bogardus contributed.\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC. Copyright 2023.

{"title": "Controversy Surrounds Blockbuster Superconductivity Claim", "date": "2023-09-29 15:20:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nWill a possible breakthrough for room-temperature superconducting materials hold up to scrutiny?\nEditor’s Note (9/29/23): This article from March 10 reported on a study claiming the discovery of room-temperature superconducting material that was published in Nature. Earlier this week the Wall Street Journal reported that nearly three quarters of that paper’s co-authors had contacted the publisher to ask that the study be retracted because it had flaws. Nature confirmed that it is in contact with this group and plans to take action.\nThis week researchers claimed to have discovered a superconducting material that can shuttle electricity with no loss of energy under near-real-world conditions. But drama and controversy behind the scenes have many worried that the breakthrough may not hold up to scientific scrutiny.\n“If you were to find a room-temperature, room-pressure superconductor, you’d have a completely new host of technologies that would occur—that we haven’t even begun to dream about,” says Eva Zurek, a computational chemist at the University at Buffalo, who was not involved in the new study. “This could be a real game changer if it turns out to be correct.”\nScientists have been studying superconductors for more than a century. By carrying electricity without shedding energy in the form of heat, these materials could make it possible to create incredibly efficient power lines and electronics that never overheat. Superconductors also repel magnetic fields. This property lets researchers levitate magnets over a superconducting material as a fun experiment—and it could also lead to more efficient high-speed maglev trains. Additionally, these materials could produce super strong magnets for use in wind turbines, portable magnetic resonance imaging machines or even nuclear fusion power plants.\nThe only superconducting materials previously discovered require extreme conditions to function, which makes them impractical for many real-world applications. The first known superconductors had to be cooled with liquid helium to temperatures only a few degrees above absolute zero. In the 1980s researchers found superconductivity in a category of materials called cuprates, which work at higher temperatures yet still require cooling with liquid nitrogen. Since 2015 scientists have measured room-temperature superconductive behavior in hydrogen-rich materials called hydrides. but they have to be pressed in a sophisticated viselike instrument called a diamond anvil cell until they reach a pressure of about a quarter to half of that found near the center of Earth.\nThe new material, called nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride, is a blend of hydrogen, the rare-earth metal lutetium and nitrogen. Although this material also relies on a diamond anvil cell, the study found that it begins exhibiting superconductive behavior at a pressure of about 10,000 atmospheres—roughly 100 times lower than the pressures that other hydrides require. The new material is “much closer to ambient pressure than previous materials,” says David Ceperley, a condensed matter physicist at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not involved in the new study. He also notes that the material remains stable when stored at a room pressure of one atmosphere. “Previous stuff was only stable at a million atmospheres, so you couldn’t really take it out of the diamond anvil” cell, he says. “The fact that it’s stable at one atmosphere of pressure, that also means that it’d be easier to manufacture.”\nHydrogen is key to the new material’s superconducting ability and to that of any hydride. In the 1960s researchers first calculated that the metallic form of this element might be a superconductor. The idea is that superconductivity occurs when electrons pair up and form a new state of matter and that this could happen in the soup of electrons that surrounds a metal’s nuclei—particularly when those nuclei belong to ultralight hydrogen atoms. Unfortunately, making those atoms shift their phase from gas to metal would require extreme pressure—about one and a half times greater than pressures at the center of this planet. But if a hydrogen atom is combined with one or two other elements in the form of a hydride, researchers think the other atoms would compress the hydrogen, allowing it to attain a metallic state at lower, much more easily obtainable pressures. “We wanted to find the right rare-earth material to mimic these same metallic hydrogen properties as much lower pressures. So that’s where the lutetium metal came into the picture,” says study co-author Ranga Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester. “And then the use of nitrogen is to stabilize these structures.”\nThe material, described in a Nature paper published this week, could raise hopes for other hydrides that lower the pressure requirements still further. Unfortunately, the work is dogged by controversy over previous papers by Dias and study co-author Ashkan Salamat, a physicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “There are two approaches possible. One is just ignore the past and look at this paper and just see what it is,” says Dirk van der Marel, a professor emeritus at the University of Geneva, who was not involved in the new study. “And if I do that, then it is a great paper.” The authors, he notes, used multiple tests of superconductivity, which provided an “extraordinary richness of data.” But van der Marel does not automatically trust these data, in part because of his experience analyzing previous work from the same authors.\nIn 2020 Dias, Salamat and their colleagues published a Nature paper describing room-temperature superconductivity in a different material, called carbonaceous sulfur hydride. Jorge Hirsch, a physicist at University of California, San Diego, questioned the appearance of data demonstrating the extent to which the material could become magnetized, referred to as its “magnetic susceptibility,” and called on the authors to release their raw data. This measurement is important because it indicates one sign of a superconductor: the ability to expel a magnetic field, a phenomenon called the Meissner effect. Because this measurement must be made while the superconducting hydride is in a diamond anvil cell, results contain background noise. To remove that noise, researchers take a separate measurement of the background and subtract it from the raw data to give the final magnetic susceptibility value. Dias and Salamat pushed back against Hirsch’s claims and eventually released the requested data. Hirsch and van der Marel worked together to analyze those data and concluded they had been processed in an unconventional way at best or had been manipulated at worst. Dias and Salamat contend that their processing method had been misunderstood.\nThe controversy drove Nature to retract the 2020 paper in 2022, a decision to which all its authors objected. Dias and Salamat say they stand by their results, and two investigations by the University of Rochester, where Dias works, found no wrongdoing. The authors also say they have rerun the original experiments at two different Department of Energy labs with outside observers present and that this effort verified the original results. “Time is a great peer-review process,” Salamat says. Dias says the researchers have updated their original paper as a preprint and resubmitted it to Nature. Other labs, however, have not been able to replicate the original results independently. But it can take a long time for a lab to reproduce and then test a specific material. The drawn out conflict has involved the release of multiple preprints, with neither side accepting the other’s arguments. And it eventually became so acrimonious that administrators of the preprint server arXiv.org removed papers from both parties and put Hirsch under a temporary publishing ban, which he objected to. “My papers analyzed the data and pointed out inconsistencies,” he says.\nHirsch previously earned a reputation as an outspoken critic of superconductivity research, but he and van der Marel were not the only researchers to investigate these authors. In addition to looking at magnetic susceptibility, James Hamlin, a physicist at the University of Florida, examined the electrical resistance data from the 2020 Nature paper. When a material reaches a superconducting state, its electrical resistance drops to zero. The measurement of this phenomenon does not require any processing to remove background noise like the magnetic susceptibility data do. Yet Hamlin notes that even the resistance data appeared to have undergone this processing, which was not disclosed in the paper. He finds Dias’s and Salamat’s responses to be insufficient explanations of these discrepancies. “They’ve kind of muddied the waters by publishing these things that have the appearance of a scientific argument,” Hamlin says. “But if you actually examine their response..., it just holds no water. And it does not address the concerns” raised by other researchers.\nHamlin went on to analyze a paper that Dias and Salamat published in Physical Review Letters (PRL) in 2021 in which they and their colleagues measured another hydride called manganese sulfide. Hamlin noted similarities between the electrical resistance data in the 2021 paper and those in Dias’s 2013 Ph.D. thesis, which had involved a completely different superconducting material. He shared these concerns with the journal and the paper’s authors. Salamat has since responded, suggesting that even though the two data sets may appear similar, the resemblance is not indicative of copied data. “We’ve shown that if you just overlay other people’s data qualitatively, a lot of things look the same,” he says. “This is a very unfair approach.”\nThis did not satisfy at least one of Salamat’s co-authors on the PRL paper: Simon A. J. Kimber, a former researcher, was disturbed to hear about the potential problem with the data and agrees with Hamlin’s conclusions. “I’ve been at this game for a long time, and I couldn’t think of a single reasonable explanation as to why those data sets should overlap like that,” he says. “I replied to everybody, to PRL’s editors, and said, ‘I think this should be retracted. I can’t think of any logical reason why this should be—retract, retract, retract.’” According to Jessica Thomas, executive editor at the journal’s publisher, the American Physical Society, editors are currently investigating these claims. “We take allegations of data fabrication very seriously,” she says. “At the same time, professional reputations are at stake, and we have to gather information thoughtfully and accurately. We also strive to ensure that the exchanges remain professional and respectful.”\nGiven the past controversies, Dias and Salamat took pains to test the new material thoroughly for their new paper, performing three different categories of experiments that suggest superconductivity had occurred. “The key fields that you wanted to provide, in order to prove superconductivity, is electrical resistance goes to zero, magnetic susceptibility—which is a demonstration of this expelling the magnetic fields—and heat capacity measurements. These are three different directions,” Dias says. “In this paper, our group has done all three measurements, including submeasurements,” such as two different measurements of magnetic susceptibility for both continuous and fluctuating fields.\nThe new paper also provides a “recipe” for other researchers who want to synthesize the new hydride and test it themselves, but the authors have not shared existing samples of the material. They are co-founding a start-up called Unearthly Materials to commercialize room-temperature superconductors and say they do not wish to reveal their intellectual property. “We have incredibly clear, detailed instructions on how to make these materials, like all of our studies. We just ask that the groups that are in denial ... go through the protocols themselves,” Salamat says. “We’re excited to see other groups replicate and push forward the field of high-temperature superconductivity.” Some researchers, such as Kimber, have stated they would not devote time and resources to replicating the results because they do not trust the new paper. But other superconducting labs may make the attempt.\nIf they do succeed at replicating these results, they could open up fascinating new lines of research. For instance, the exact structure of the new material is not yet fully understood. Salamat has used imaging methods that reveal where the heavy lutetium atoms are within the compound, but the team isn’t yet certain about the configuration of the lighter hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. The material also contains relatively little hydrogen, even though this is the substance that theoretically gives hydrides their superconducting ability. Multiple researchers, including Zurek and Ceperley, were intrigued by this contradiction. It could point to alternate theories for how superconductivity arises in hydride materials.\nThe big claims made in this paper, as well as past controversies, have raised the bar for proof, says Michael Norman, group leader of the condensed matter theory group at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, who was not involved in the new study. But a reluctance to trust results until they are replicated is not unusual in the field of superconductivity. He points to the 1986 discovery of cuprates, which were found to be superconducting at much higher temperatures than previous materials. After it was published, “over the first six months, people pretty much didn’t pay the paper much attention. But then when the result was reproduced by a Japanese group, that’s sort of when everybody jumped into the field,” Norman says. As for the new study, “I’m pretty sure that people will be cautiously optimistic until they see another group reproduce it.”\nSophie Bushwick is an associate editor covering technology at Scientific American.

{"title": "Eaten, Crushed or Starved; Male Tarantulas Trade Their Life to Impregnate a Mate", "date": "2023-09-29 15:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nAfter eight years maturing in a burrow, male tarantulas venture out to mate, then die a cruel death\nOn an early evening in September, 16 dark, hairy legs were kicking up dust on the prairie floor in La Junta, Colo. A male Oklahoma brown tarantula was locked in a heated mating match with a female twice his age. Although weary, he plunged a set of hooks that had recently grown on his front legs into his mate’s mouth, just below her glossy fangs, to prevent her from chewing him up.\nThe intense ritual was taking place across the arid grasslands of southeastern Colorado, where the tarantula mating season spans September. Female tarantulas can live multiple decades and never travel more than a few inches from their burrows. Males mature in seven to 10 years, and when they finally venture beyond their burrows, they have only one goal—mate—and then their life’s job is done.\n“They weren’t evolved to survive,” says entomologist Maia Holmes, education and outreach coordinator at the department of agricultural biology at Colorado State University. “They are at the end of their life cycles, and this is their last hurrah.” Similar fates await male tarantulas in other western U.S. states, in Central and South America, and around the world.\nUsing a specialized appendage near his mouth called a pedipalp, the male spider reached forward and carefully slid a packet of sperm into the female’s abdominal cavity. The package contained enough sperm to fertilize upward of 1,500 eggs. Typically only a few spiders from a clutch of hundreds survive into adulthood; offspring only need to replace their parents to sustain a population.\nOnce our male—let’s call him Spiderman—carefully extracted his hooks from his mate’s fangs, he dropped to the ground and scurried backward while the female was still reared up like a horse on her hind legs. All tarantulas are nearly blind their whole life, so he was fleeing by feel.\nSpiderman might have tried to mate again, if he could summon the energy. But in the following weeks only one thing was certain: he would perish. Spiderman didn’t die like his father may have: eaten head-first by his female mate. Both ravenous and bold, the mother would strike the father’s head with her venom as soon as he finished gifting his sperm and immediately take a bite from his left “temple.” Spiderman had picked a mate who, luckily for him, had recently eaten.\nOur protagonist didn’t die like his brother may have either. The sibling, let’s call him Brother, was taken captive by a tarantula hawk, a massive spider wasp that grows to two inches long. Tarantula hawks are pollinators, sampling nectar from flowering plants, but when it’s time to raise their young, the females of the species take on a different demeanor.\nBrother had just stopped to rest on a quiet patch of dirt when he was attacked. For several minutes the wasp circled him, flitting in and out with the agile prodding of a fencer. Brother did what most tarantulas do when they feel threatened: he froze. The wasp turned upside down and maneuvered under Brother’s abdomen to search for a soft spot, like a mechanic sliding under the chassis of a car, and injected his paralyzing venom there.\nThe tarantula hawk dragged his paralyzed but living prey into Brother’s own den and laid a single egg on his abdomen. Over the next couple of weeks, the egg hatched, and the developing insect that emerged ate its way through Brother’s tissues, saving vital organs for last so that he stayed alive and fresh, though starved, for as long as possible.\nFortunately, Spiderman also didn’t die like any number of his cousins—crushed by a semitruck while scrambling across a street in search of a mate. Moments before they die this way, the poor-sighted tarantulas can sense a vehicle’s vibrations through their highly sensitive paws on the pavement, but by then it’s too late. And as habitat fragmentation continues, and humans’ footprint on the landscape widens, this fate will become increasingly common.\nOur Spiderman died a slower death. After mating, he lost interest in food. He became weak because the majority of his energy reserves went to sperm production. He managed to avoid tarantula hawks and roads. But as he continued to lose energy, his body became slower, more rigid. The blood pressure generated from his heartbeat slowed, causing his legs to curl inward—what’s known in the spider world as the “death curl.” It was also time for him to molt his exoskeleton, an impossible feat that sealed his fate. “Molting is like pulling yourself from a suit of armor without using your hands,” Holmes says. “And for a male spider who has mated, his hooks and reproductive parts prevent his molt from sliding off. They get stuck.”\nAs the hours went on, Spiderman twitched less. He stopped fighting. And as he lay there, curled up beside a halo of small yellow flowers—perhaps the very flowers pollinated by the wasp that killed his brother—he had no idea of the impact he had on the world. He had no idea that his position as a key predator in his ecosystem helped manage its insect population, no idea that his eight-legged form inspired robotic technology and innovations in artificial webbing and no idea of the future that a changing planet might have in store for his descendants.\nResearchers are trying to understand what climate change might do to tarantula populations. As temperatures warm, and flowers’ growing season extends later into the year, the pollinating tarantula hawks might be out later. Male tarantulas might be mating at a time when more wasps—more threats—are around, explains Richard Reading, vice president of science and conservation at an invertebrate zoo called the Butterfly Pavilion in Denver and an adjunct professor at the University of Denver. “Tarantulas also have a mechanical system to their movement; heat impacts that, too,” Reading says.\nBack in La Junta, Spiderman’s own mechanics were failing. In these final moments, his partially shed exoskeleton blocked his book lungs—delicate, platelike structures that allowed air to enter his body passively. He was running out of energy and now oxygen. But just moments before he faded away, a bushy-tailed Swift Fox no bigger than a house cat swiped him up and gobbled him.\nIn these grasslands, tarantulas are both prey for numerous species and top predators, crucial to keeping the insect populations at bay and the ecology in balance. “All creatures serve a purpose in the web of life. Every species contributes to the stability of an ecosystem,” Reading says.\nThe fox wandered into the night as the sun set over the dusty hills of La Junta, perhaps trotting over the very burrow that housed the female who now held the future of Spiderman’s bloodline. As humans, we often anthropomorphize the animal kingdom, and some of us may feel pity for our central character. But “there are no good guys or bad guys in nature–it’s all interconnected,” Holmes says. “Everything needs to exist for everything else to exist.”\nKatie Weeman is a science writer based in Denver, Colo., and communications director at the Colorado Water Conservation Board.

{"title": "Stop Trying to 'Find' Your Passion--There's a Better Way to Love What You Do", "date": "2023-09-29 13:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nRecognizing that interests are malleable and can be developed can make us more resilient, open and creative\n“Find your passion!” Whether we hear it from our parents, teachers, bosses or college commencement speakers, this injunction is woven into the fabric of American culture. It is well-intended and meant to inspire. But is it good advice?\n“Finding” a passion implies that it already exists fully formed and is simply waiting to be discovered. Unfortunately, this idea doesn’t square with what science tells us. Instead passions, like interests, are developed. They often begin with a spark of curiosity caused by something in one’s environment, such as a fascinating physics lecture or a moving piece of art. Through a process involving repeated engagement, positive experiences and accrued knowledge, people can come to personally value that content or activity and internalize it. What was at first interesting becomes an interest. If these qualities continue to intensify, a passion can emerge.\nIn several studies, we and our colleagues have found that misunderstanding this idea can hold people back. Assuming passions are immutable and essential—rather than something to cultivate and build—can cause people to be less open to different topics, less resilient to challenges in pursuit of new interests and less creative when problem-solving. Fortunately, our latest research reveals that there are ways to correct course and cultivate a more open, accurate perspective about interest.\nTo study these ideas, we use a framework of “fixed” and “growth” mindsets, which may be familiar from educational research. In school, conceiving of one’s intellectual abilities as fixed can be detrimental, whereas believing one can develop and grow skills supports greater learning. We argue that encouraging people to “find” their passion may cause them to eventually believe that interests and passions are inherent and relatively unchangeable. People who think this have a fixed mindset of interest. By contrast, some people, whom we refer to as having a growth mindset of interest, view their interests and passions as developed.\nOur work has revealed that fixed and growth mindsets about interest are distinct from fixed and growth mindsets surrounding intellectual abilities. We have also repeatedly found that a growth mindset of interest comes with many advantages. People with a fixed mindset of interest, for example, may fall into the trap of thinking, “If I have already found my passion, why keep exploring?” In our studies, after engaging in a new science task, arts students with a fixed mindset expressed less interest in that scientific topic than arts students with a growth mindset. Meanwhile science students with a fixed mindset responded similarly to an art-related task. For those with a growth mindset, having a strong pre-existing interest in the arts or sciences did not preclude them from viewing a new area as interesting.\nIn addition, people with a fixed mindset of interest tend to expect their passions to provide limitless motivation, such that their favorite topics should never feel too difficult or demanding. In one study we tested this idea by sparking people’s interest in a topic that was new for them—the science of black holes—with a fun, easy-to-understand animated video about Stephen Hawking’s theories. But when we next asked our participants to read a dense and complex article on black holes from a scientific journal, people with a fixed mindset were frustrated by the technical reading and came to dislike the topic. Meanwhile those with a growth mindset maintained their newfound interest despite the difficulty.\nA fixed mindset of interest can also inhibit creativity and innovation. If people believe they are limited to only a few inherent interests and, in consequence, do not explore other areas, they may miss seeing important connections across different domains. When we recruited undergraduates who identified as either an “arts person” or a “sciences person,” we found that those with a fixed mindset were less likely than those with a growth mindset to generate novel solutions—for example, ideas for new university programs—that integrated the arts and sciences. In other words, seeing interests as fixed stymied their creative potential. That loss is especially unfortunate when we consider how leaders at innovative companies have long prized problem-solving that melds ideas from diverse disciplines and brings together science, technology, art and the humanities.\nSo can a growth mindset of interest be taught? In June we published findings from an intervention that succeeded in that aim. In two studies involving more than 700 first-year liberal arts undergraduates in total, we began by assessing how our participants saw themselves. The majority held strong interests in the arts, humanities and social sciences. Moreover, most reported that they were not a “math-and-science person.” We then randomly assigned students to either our intervention or a study skills module. Both programs were online and took most students less than half an hour to complete during their university orientation week.\nOur intervention included reading and reflective writing activities that helped students think about interests and passions as cultivated rather than as simply found and fixed. For example, the students read a short article that presented research on the benefits of viewing interests as developable. They also wrote a paragraph about an occasion when they developed interest in a new activity. We were careful to present this material in a neutral way—not as a corrective of their current behavior but rather as part of an exercise by their college to better support students’ transition to college. The study skills module had a similar set of exercises but with an emphasis on building classic skills, such as time management and active learning.\nImportantly, these students were required to take at least one math and science course during their first year. That meant we could check how the intervention may have influenced their perspectives on math and science. By the end of the year, students who had received the intervention were more interested in their required math and science courses than those who received the study skills module—and this boost was particularly apparent among students who initially reported that they were not a “math-and-science person.” They also earned better grades in those courses than their counterparts who had received the study skills module. These students, who might have otherwise eschewed these disciplines, became more skilled in math and science and grew into interdisciplinary scholars.\nAlthough our intervention offers a way for schools to support students in cultivating a growth mindset, we believe people can do a lot independently to embrace this way of thinking. First, realize that your interests and passions aren’t pre-existing and waiting to be “found.” Take an active role in developing your passions. Indulge your curiosities, get involved, and don’t expect that pursuing new interests will always be easy or exciting. If you’re a parent, teacher or boss, consider how you might foster a growth mindset of interest in others. Create opportunities for them to pursue their curiosities and interests and engender a culture that rewards exploration; the seeds of passion cannot grow in infertile soil. Of course, exploration can at times lead to failure or disappointment, so communicating that such negative experiences are normal will help others stay motivated through challenges. Finally, consider how you phrase feedback. When someone expresses waning interest in a novel task, signal that interests can develop with time and engagement.\nOf course, not every activity will become a burning passion. But a growth mindset of interest will help you remain open and curious. The old saying “find something you love to do, and you’ll never have to work a day in your life” needs to be updated. The science tells us we should instead work toward loving what we do. We might expand our horizons and become more creative and resilient as a result.\nAre you a scientist who specializes in neuroscience, cognitive science or psychology?

{"title": "What Humans Lose When AI Writes for Us", "date": "2023-09-29 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nIn Who Wrote This? linguist Naomi S. Baron discusses how artificial intelligence threatens our ability to express ourselves\nArtificial intelligence has pervaded much of our daily life, whether it’s in the form of scarily believable deepfakes, online news containing “written by AI” taglines or novel tools that could diagnose health conditions. It can feel like everything we do is run through some sort of software, interpreted by some mysterious program and kept on a server who knows where. When will the robots take over already? Have they already taken over?\nThe recent developments in AI offer existential questions we’ve been wrestling with since we put pen to proverbial paper: Who wrote this, and can I trust it? Fake news is old news, but some still argue over whether Shakespeare existed or represented multiple authors. Large language models (LLMs) are combinations of authors, each with their own style, voice and expertise. If the generative AI program ChatGPT keeps trying—and we keep feeding it Shakespeare—will it write our next great tragedy?\nLinguist Naomi S. Baron of American University has been wading in the AI waters for years. In her latest book, Who Wrote This? How AI and the Lure of Efficiency Threaten Human Writing, she dives into the crux of the matter: If we hand over the written word to AI, what will we lose? Scientific American spoke with Baron on the issue of the ownership and trustworthiness of written communication now that AI is on the scene.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nDid you use ChatGPT to write any of this book?\nSort of but just a smidge. I completed Who Wrote This? in mid-November 2022, two weeks before ChatGPT burst on the scene. It was a no-brainer that I needed to incorporate something about the new wonder bot.\nMy solution was to query ChatGPT about the intersection of this cutting-edge form of AI with issues such as creativity, education and copyright. In the book, I quote some of ChatGPT’s responses.\nWhen I asked ChatGPT if it could hold copyright on short stories that it authored, the answer was “no” the first time I asked and “yes” the second. The discrepancy reflected the particular part of the dataset that the program dipped into. For the “no” answer, ChatGPT informed me that as an LLM, it was “not capable of holding copyrights or owning any form of intellectual property.”\nBy U.S. copyright law, that’s true. But for the “yes” response, the bot invoked other aspects of U.S. copyright: “In order for a work to be protected by copyright, it must be original and fixed in a tangible form, such as being written down or recorded. If a short story written by GPT meets these criteria, [ChatGPT said], then it would be eligible for copyright protection.\nConsistency is the hobgoblin of large language models.\nWhen thinking about AI-written news, is it all just a snake eating its own tail? Is AI writing just fodder to train other AIs on?\nYou’re right. The only thing relevant to a large language dataset is having text to consume. AI isn’t sentient, and it’s incapable of caring about the source.\nBut what happens to human communication when it’s my bot talking to your bot? Microsoft, Google and others are building out AI-infused e-mail functions that increasingly “read” what’s in our inbox and then draft replies for us. Today’s AI tools can learn your writing style and produce a reasonable facsimile of what you might have written yourself.\nMy concern is that it’s all too tempting to yield to such wiles in the name of saving time and minimizing effort. Whatever else makes us human, the ability to use words and grammar for expressing our thoughts and feelings is a critical chunk of that essence.\nIn your book, you write, “We domesticate technology.” But what does that “domestication” look like for AI?\nThink about our canine companions. They descended from wolves, and it took many years, plus evolution, for some of their species to evolve into dogs, to be domesticated.\nSocial scientists talk about “domestication” of technology. Forty years ago personal computers were novelties. Now they’re ubiquitous, as are software programs running on them. Even Wikipedia—once seen as a dubious information source—has become domesticated.\nWe take editing tools such as spell-check and autocomplete and predictive texting for granted. The same goes for translation programs. What remains to be seen is how domesticated we will make text-generation programs, such as ChatGPT, that create documents out of whole virtual cloth.\nHow has your understanding of AI and LLMs changed how you read and approach writing?\nWhat a difference three years makes! For my own writing, I remain old-fashioned. I sometimes still draft by hand. By contrast, in my role as a university professor, I’ve changed how I approach students’ written work. In years past I assumed the text was their own—not so today. With AI-infused editing and style programs such as Microsoft Editor or Grammarly, not to mention full-blown text-generation tools, at students’ beck and call, I no longer know who wrote what.\nWhat are the AI programs that you feel are the least threatening, or that you think should be embraced?\nAI’s writing ability is an incredible tour de force. But like the discovery of fire, we must figure out how best to harness it. Given the novelty of current programs, it will take at least several years to feel our way.\nToday’s translation programs, while not perfect, are remarkably good, and the benefit is that everyday users who don’t know a language can get immediate access to documents they would have no other way of reading. Of course, a potential drawback is losing motivation for learning foreign languages.\nAnother promising use of generative AI is for editing human-generated text. I’m enthusiastic when AI becomes a pedagogical tool but less so when it simply mops up after the writer, with no lessons learned. It’s on users to be active participants in the composition process.\nAs you say in your book, there is a risk of valuing the speed and potential efficiency of ChatGPT over the development of human skills. With the benefit of spell-check, we can lose our own spelling proficiency. What do you think we’ll similarly lose first from ChatGPT’s ability to write legal documents, e-mails or even news articles?\nAs I argue in my book, the journalism business will likely feel the effects on employment numbers, though I’m not so much worried about the writing skills of the journalists who remain.\nE-mails are a more nuanced story. On the one hand, if you use Microsoft Outlook or Gmail, you’ve already been seeing a lot of autocomplete when you write e-mails. On the other hand, the new versions of AI (think of GPT-4) are writing entire e-mails on their own. It can now literally be my bot writing to your bot. I worry that the likes of ChatGPT will lull us into not caring about crafting our own messages, in our own voice, with our own sentiments, when writing to people who are personally important to us.\nWhat do you think of the recent and potential copyright infringement cases involving authors or publishers and ChatGPT?\nThe copyright infringement cases are interesting because we really are in uncharted territory. You’ll remember the case of the The Authors Guild v. Google, where the guild claimed Google Books enabled copyright infringement when it digitized books without permission and then displayed snippets. After many years of litigation, Google won ... under the ruling of fair use.\nFrom what I’ve been reading from lawyers who are copyright experts, I suspect that OpenAI [the company that developed ChatGPT] will end up winning as well. But here’s the difference from the Authors Guild case: With Google Books, authors stood to lose royalties because users of Google Books were presumably less likely to purchase copies of the books themselves. With ChatGPT, however, if a user invokes the bot to generate a text, and then said user looks to sell that text for a profit, it could be a different ball game. This is the basis of cases in the world of generative art.

{"title": "EPA's Critics Recycle Nonsense about Cost to Cut Pollution", "date": "2023-09-29 11:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nFor decades industry has claimed that curbing pollution costs too much, but the reality has proven otherwise. Here we go again, this time on power plant carbon emissions\nAs young lawyers, working out of the dusty attic in an aging townhouse, a few of us were given a simple but monumental task: figure out how to make a new law—the Clean Air Act—work.\nThe struggle for clean air we engaged in five decades ago is, sadly, relevant once again as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to create the first carbon standards for power plants.\nIn 1971 the EPA was less than a year old, and Congress had given it just a few months to set limits to pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, that harm our lungs and can cause asthma. The EPA moved quickly, issuing rules that year mandating that new coal-fired power plants either install scrubbers or burn low-sulfur coal.\nScrubbers act like chemical cleaners of smokestack exhaust. While ubiquitous now, only a few were then in operation. Still, the EPA determined the equipment would perform well once the standards were in place. What happened next would not surprise anyone who has followed the Clean Air Act for the past five decades: the electric companies howled.\nIn a full-page New York Times advertisement, American Electric Power claimed that scrubbers have been “time and time again proven too unreliable, too impractical for electric utility use.” It concluded: “If the system doesn’t clog and shut down, it creates massive amounts of sludge.”\nUnder pressure from coal-heavy utilities and their congressional allies, the EPA undertook nationwide listening sessions where the agency’s new bureaucrats were bombarded with criticism: the new rules relied on unproven technology; the compliance deadline was too tight; jobs would be lost; the electricity grid would falter; prices would skyrocket, and the American economy would suffer a monumental toll.\nI watched all this blowback with alarm, wondering if the EPA and Congress would back down. In the end, the utilities and coal companies managed to secure a few short delays and technical tweaks, but the EPA—with support and legal pressure from the Natural Resources Defense Council (where I still work today)—stuck by its crucial pollution control requirements for those new plants.\nWhen the companies’ lawyers failed to block the rules, the companies’ engineers took over. And they delivered.\nSulfur dioxide pollution has fallen by more than 90 percent in the U.S., thanks to EPA rules—one of the great environmental protection achievements in the history of the U.S. The EPA found that without the clean air standards put in place after 1970, 205,000 more Americans would have died prematurely over the subsequent two decades, and millions more would have suffered illnesses ranging from asthma to high blood pressure. The economic benefits in just those two decades are stunning, with estimates ranging from $6 trillion to $50 trillion.\nOver the past five decades, however, the electricity industry has kept crying wolf whenever the EPA proposes new pollution limits.\nWhether it was the acid rain programs in the 1990s or the EPA rules to cut mercury and other toxic air pollutants in 2012, the industry’s playbook remains the same: Sure, we want to protect public health and the environment, they will say, but your rules—now the power plant carbon standards— are too much, too fast, too expensive. We won’t be able to keep delivering reliable electricity.\nAnd, just as with sulfur dioxide, once the rules are in place and the company engineers get to work, deadlines are met, pollution is cut—and the American economy keeps humming along. In fact, in nearly every case the power sector has cut pollution faster and for less money than the EPA forecast.\nAnd so, here we are today.\nIn May, the EPA proposed critical standards to cut carbon pollution from power plants. Long overdue, they come 14 years after EPA determined that carbon dioxide endangers our health and well-being by driving destructive climate change. The standards, which would phase in requirements on coal and gas plants over a decade or more, are an important piece of the puzzle to address the climate crisis.\nGiven market trends toward cheaper wind and solar energy and the billions of dollars of clean energy incentives in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, the electricity sector is changing. Clean energy is on the rise. These rules will ensure those economic and carbon reduction benefits are fully delivered.\nMany utilities have publicly committed to cut their carbon emissions, some laying out plans to get to net zero by 2050, and mostly there by the mid-2030s. But now that the EPA is actually setting rules to make sure they follow that path, the familiar arguments are back: This is too much and too fast. The EPA rules will endanger grid reliability. And the costs—oh my!\nNonsense. Fifty years of experience tell us that when companies stop relying on their lawyers, their engineers and grid experts know how to keep the lights on. And the EPA’s proposed rules allow for exceptions, extensions and waivers if real reliability problems should crop up, so that power companies can keep their plants operating when needed.   \nAnd, in fact, we’ve been here before.\nBack in 2015, the Obama administration adopted the first carbon pollution standards for power plants with rules aimed at delivering a 32-percent reduction in power plant emissions by 2030. Big industry dusted off the old playbook. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued: “It will drive up electricity costs for businesses, consumers and families, [and] impose tens of billions in annual compliance costs.” The North American Electric Reliability Corporation, NERC, a nonprofit that oversees the system, said the “proposed timeline does not provide enough time to develop sufficient resources to ensure continued reliable operation of the electric grid.” And coal industry interests went to court to block the rule. In a rare move, the Supreme Court stepped in to stay the EPA standards.\nThe Clean Power Plan never went into effect.\nBut then something remarkable happened: While the rules were on hold, the U.S. hit the Clean Power Plan targets of a 32-percent reduction in carbon emissions—11 years early! Again, even with no rules in place, the power sector achieved what industry claimed would lead to steep costs and reliability problems.\nCheaper, cleaner options have replaced many old fossil-fuel plants. With the historic support from tax incentives passed by Congress, new technologies are coming online quickly. And the grid continues to deliver cleaner, affordable, reliable electricity. But, given the climate crisis, we need new standards now to cut carbon pollution faster.\nIt’s time for industry to throw away its old playbook and put its engineers to work.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nDavid Hawkins is a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

{"title": "Song of the Stars, Part 3: The Universe in all Senses", "date": "2023-09-29 11:00:00", "text": "An astronomy festival in Italy opted to make all of its events and workshops multisensory. They wanted to see whether sound, touch and smell can, like sight, transmit the wonders of the cosmos.\n[CLIP: Music]\nTimmy Broderick: So I’m sitting inside this stone clock tower in the small town of Castellaro Lagusello in Italy. It’s pretty old, like 800 years old. I had found a nook in this tower where I could sit and record this ethereal music coming from the speaker in front of me. And through the slit of a window behind me, I could watch Italians mill about below.\nJason Drakeford: So Timmy, why are you being a recluse in this tower instead of talking with people on the ground?\nBroderick: [Laughs.] Well, it’s a fair question. I was gathering tape to be played on this podcast, but it was also my last day at the Universe in All Senses, it’s an astronomy festival. And I was pooped. For three days, I ran around this tiny, picturesque town capturing what was likely the first multisensory astronomy festival ever.\n[CLIP: Music]\nBroderick: Oh, does this sound familiar?\nDrakeford: Yes! That’s Matt Russo’s TRAPPIST-1 sonification that we listened to in the first episode!\nBroderick: Yeah! The festival organizers rigged up the clock tower to play a bunch of sonifications on a loop, and then at night, they’d project visualizations of these compositions onto the face of the clock tower.\n[CLIP: Show theme music]\nDrakeford: You are listening to Scientific American’s Science, Quickly. I’m Jason Drakeford.\nBroderick: And I’m Timmy Broderick. In the prior episode of this three-part Fascination, we dove into the origins of turning space data into sound. In this final episode, we’re traveling to Italy to see whether astronomical sonifications can help people with disabilities better understand the awe and wonder of the cosmos.\nBroderick [on tape]: Okay, so I’m walking around. Four thousand people at once is a lot…\nDrakeford: Okay so how did you even hear about this festival?\nBroderick: In January I wrote a story about this burgeoning movement in astronomy. One of my sources for that story was Anita Zanella. She’s an Italian astronomer who grew up playing with her relatives on the stone streets of Castellaro Lagusello. She told me about the festival.\nAnita Zanella: Castellaro has a lot of historical buildings. The villa and the lake are typical ones. The other important point for this little village is the tower, which is really the key part, the heart, of the village.\nBroderick: Castellaro has been holding an astronomy festival for a couple years now. But this is the first time it has really been multisensory. Every workshop, every talk, every event—all of them were available in at least two senses.\nZanella: Inclusion is the main focus this year. So being able to share the knowledge and the beauty of astronomy and the beauty of the universe with whoever, irrespective of disability and sensory limitations.\nBroderick: They also had these giant QR code-like signs set up around the festival to help blind people navigate and understand a workshop or exhibit.\nDrakeford: Uhuh.\nBroderick: It was pretty wild. My phone picked up the code from like 10 feet away!\nDrakeford: Woah, this is so cool!\n[CLIP: Festival sound]\nBroderick: Yeah. The highlight of the first evening was the keynote panel with Anita and two visually impaired astronomers, Nic Bonne and Enrique Pérez-Montero. You might remember Enrique from our last episode. The three of them discussed how to build a “multi-sensory discovery of the sky above us.”\n[CLIP: Festival sound]\nBroderick: After the discussion, I talked with Claudia Beschi. She’s 25, hails from nearby Mantova, wants to be a translator and just completed graduate school. She found the discussion fascinating. She’s also been blind since birth.\n[CLIP: “The Bullet Cluster” by Matt Russo] \nClaudia Beschi: I didn’t think it was possible to translate galaxies into sounds.... I felt like nature was talking to me.\nI believe that nature has its own sounds. And listening to that sound, it was as if that galaxy was telling something to me. Like this galaxy was describing itself to me.\nDrakeford: Woah. The galaxy was speaking to her. This is wild!\nBroderick: Yeah, I was actually really moved by that conversation. It stuck with me throughout the festival.\nAnd so the next day was the first, like, full day. There was a lot going on. We had a bunch of workshops happening. We had a radio wave scavenger hunt, we had comet smelling, there was crafting galaxies out of felt and other fabrics, and also last but definitely not least, banging pots and pans to represent stellar energies.\n[CLIP: Pots and pans banging]\nAll of the workshops were staffed by local kids who could teach the attendees and especially the young kids. Elisa Zaltieri goes to high school in Mantova, and she ran the pots and pans station.\nZaltieri: It's an activity about how stars are actually different. We make child play pots actually.\nBroderick (tape): So what are you gonna have these kids do?\nZaltieri: We have to make them recognize how stars are different and then we have to make them play, like, if they were stars.\nWe were trying to explain to them that [for] the biggest star, play the hardest. And the smallest, play lower, actually, because they have less energy.\nBroderick (tape): So if you play really loudly, you'll have more energy; if you play really softly, you’ll have less energy?\nZaltieri: Yep!\n[CLIP: Pots and pans banging]\nBroderick: While the festival was ostensibly for kids, there were many workshops and events for adults.\nMattia Grella: I’m Mattia, 33, and I’m from Verona, quite close by.\nBroderick: Mattia came to the festival for a couple of reasons. He knows one of the organizers, but he is also passionate about astronomy. He’s a hardcore Trekkie, as well. I met him at one of the workshops. He was creating a kind of patch made from different fabric textures. It was supposed to represent the different parts of a galaxy.\nGrella: It’s smooth and kind of wavy, soft but not really smooth, kind of like the music we listened to before. It was a piece played on the piano. It was a soft piece, but played with the piano, it also had kind of a certain rhythm to it. So these little waves, at least to me, they represent this softness but also this movement.\nBroderick: Mattia has been visually impaired since birth. His version of space is definitely not the inky, black expanse that you or I perceive it as.\nGrella: I know the stars are classified like yellow dwarfs, red giants. And in my head, I imagined them quite with vivid colors, but I have no idea if they’re like basically white with a slight shade of yellow, red, or if they’re as vivid as I imagine them.\n[CLIP: “SgrA Chandra” by Matt Russo] \nDrakeford: So what did you think? Was the festival successful?\nBroderick: To be honest, I’m not sure. It was definitely fun! Like, everyone I saw was having a great time and really engaged with astronomy. But I didn’t really see many people using those giant QR codes. I know that there was bus trouble that kept many local blind and partially sighted people from coming to Castellaro.\nDrakeford: Were there a lot of visually impaired people there?\n[CLIP: “The Galactic Center” by Matt Russo] \nBroderick: I don’t know how many of the 4,000 attendees were blind or visually impaired. Neither do the festival organizers. That’s just unknowable. What I do know is that for the blind people I talked with — for Claudia, for Mattia — the festival and sonifications were really helpful. Claudia was there for one night, but she was thrilled by what she heard.\nBeschi: I don’t know if I will see the world in a different way in the future, but I’m sure that this experience, in a way, taught something positive to me. Because I love nature. I think that nature speaks to us in every way possible. And these translations into sound and into tactile modes is a really good way to get in touch with nature, especially for us because we can’t, we can’t see how nature is really made of.\n[CLIP: Outro music]\nBroderick: Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose, Kelso Harper and Carin Leong. Our theme music was composed by Dominic Smith. Matt Russo provided the sonifications you heard in this episode.\nDrakeford: Don’t forget to subscribe to Science, Quickly wherever you get your podcasts.

{"title": "How to See the 'Ring of Fire' Annular Solar Eclipse of October 14", "date": "2023-09-29 10:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThis annular solar eclipse will only reveal its full glory to a select few, but onlookers across much of the Western Hemisphere can catch a partial glimpse of the dazzling phenomenon\nPeople in parts of the U.S., Mexico, and Central and South America are in for a rare celestial treat in October: an annular eclipse of the sun.\nAn annular eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, in which the moon completely covers the sun’s face, except at the former’s peak, the moon is too small in the sky to fully blot out our home star. This creates a bright ring of sunlight around a dark lunar silhouette—thus the name “annular,” which means “ring-shaped.” (Some people prefer to simply call an annular eclipse a “ring of fire” instead.)\nSolar eclipses happen when the moon passes directly in front of the sun—essentially, our natural satellite’s shadow sweeps across the surface of Earth. If the moon orbited in the same plane as Earth orbits the sun, we’d get a solar eclipse every 29 days—the length of time it takes the moon to move around our planet, relative to the sun. But the moon’s orbit is actually tipped, inclined by about five degrees to that of Earth.\nLike two Hula-Hoops, one inside the other and tipped, the path the sun appears to take around the sky once per year and the moon’s monthly orbit intersect at two points, called nodes. We only get a solar eclipse when both the sun and moon are at a node at the same time; otherwise the moon “misses” the sun in the sky, passing it above or below. Most of the time the two don’t line up perfectly, resulting in a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon blocks only a fraction of the sun’s face.\nIf they line up just right, the entirety of the sun’s Earth-facing hemisphere is blocked, and we get the glory of a total solar eclipse. The sky gets dark, and the sun’s ethereal outer atmosphere, called its corona, pops into prominence. I was in Wyoming for the 2017 total solar eclipse, and it was, without exaggeration, one of the most beautiful and moving events I have ever witnessed. The U.S. will be treated to another one of these incredible phenomena on April 8, 2024.\nBut sooner than that—on October 14, to be specific—yet another factor will come into play: the moon’s distance from Earth.\nBy an amazing coincidence, on average, the sun is 400 times farther away from Earth and 400 times physically bigger than the moon. These two effects cancel out, so the sun and moon are the same apparent size in the sky: about half a degree, or half the width of your extended pinky seen at arm’s length.\nThe moon doesn’t orbit Earth in a circle, however, but in an ellipse. At its closest, the point in its orbit called perigee, the moon is roughly 355,000 kilometers from the surface of Earth. At its farthest—apogee—it’s about 397,000 km. That change of about 10 percent in distance means that the moon’s apparent size in the sky changes by 10 percent over the course of half an orbit. So at its apogee, the moon can appear to be smaller than the sun.\nThe moon reaches apogee on October 9, just five days before this upcoming eclipse. It will be about 391,000 km from Earth—more or less. The exact figure depends on other factors, such as the latitude and longitude of the observer, the time of day, and so on. At that distance, it will appear to be 0.51 degree across. At the same time, Earth and the sun will be at almost exactly their average separation, 149 million km, so the sun will appear as a disk about 0.54 degree in size.\nAnd that makes all the difference in the worlds. The moon will be too small to completely cover the sun. Instead it will leave a ring—an annulus—around it as it passes, creating this annular eclipse. At most, 91 percent of the sun’s surface will be covered by the moon, so technically this will be a partial eclipse—but a very special, perfectly centered one.\nThe eclipse will have three main stages: first contact, annularity and last contact. First contact will be when the moon’s edge first appear to touch the edge of the sun. Over time, as the moon moves, it will appear to eat more and more of our star’s disk. About 70 to 90 minutes after first contact, depending on your location, the annularity will occur. It will last from one to five minutes, also depending on location. Then the moon will start to leave the sun’s face. Our natural satellite will take another 70 to 90 minutes to completely move off the star (last contact).\nThat’s how the eclipse will work. So how can you see it?\nFirst, there is no safe time to watch this with your naked eye! Throughout the eclipse’s duration, the sun will be visible, so you will need adequate eye protection. (Do not just use sunglasses, exposed film or welder’s glasses.) A lot of companies sell “eclipse glasses”—usually a paper frame with heavily filtered plastic film to look through—but not all of these are safe. The American Astronomical Society has a list of trusted vendors that have glasses that are compliant with the ISO 12312-2, the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO’s) safety standard for directly viewing the sun. I’ll add that Astronomy for Equity sells them in bulk, and the money they organization makes from those sales goes toward excellent causes.\nA fun way to observe this event is with a pinhole projector. A small hole poked into a piece of cardboard will allow sunlight through as parallel rays—that is, as focused light suitable for imaging. You can then hold it up and project the resulting rays onto a sheet of white paper, a sidewalk or even the bare ground. You’ll see a lovely perfect little image of the sun as the moon eats away at it. Foliage can produce a similar effect as well (overlapping leaves make lots of little holes), so you can see dozens or even hundreds of images of the sun on the ground below most trees.\nOn the morning of October 14, the path of the moon’s shadow will start over the Pacific Ocean. The exact time it will reach any given spot will depend on the location and the time zone. For example, Eugene, Ore., the first big city to see annularity, will get the first contact at 8:06 A.M. PDT, the annularity for four minutes starting at 9:16 A.M. and then the last contact at 10:39 A.M. The moon’s shadow will move southeast, passing over extremely northeastern California, Nevada, Utah, extremely northeastern Arizona, New Mexico and then Texas. After that it will pass over the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico, followed by southern Central America and then northern South America before moving off onto the Atlantic Ocean.\nAstronomer and long-time umbraphile (literally, “shadow lover”) Fred Espenak has created an interactive map for the eclipse path. Just zoom in and click anywhere to get detailed information on timing.\nI’ll add that the entire continental U.S. will see at least a partial eclipse, but only those along the narrow shadow path will be able to view the ring of fire. NASA has an excellent website with loads of information about the eclipse. SciStarter, a terrific program that promotes “citizen science” projects, has a list of scientific projects you can participate in as well—excellent prep for next year’s total solar eclipse. The American Astronomical Society also has an app (available for iOS and Android devices) called Totality 3.0, which has a ton of information about this eclipse and next year’s total one, too.\nI’ve never seen an annular eclipse, and from my location in Virginia, only be about one third of the sun will be covered. But if you’re in the path of annularity, and you’re able to do so, go out and take a look (safely, please)! Although it’s perhaps not as grand as a total solar eclipse, it’s still a fascinating and rare astronomical phenomenon and one well worth your time to observe.\nPhil Plait is a professional astronomer and science communicator in Colorado.
