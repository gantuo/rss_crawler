{"title": "In War-Torn Ukraine, a Doctor Evacuates Children with Cancer", "date": "", "text": "A pediatric oncologist is racing against time to send scores of sick children out of Ukraine for medical aid.\nRoman Kizyma The first months of war, we didn't have the weekdays, so we just worked seven days, 24 hours.\nThere are moments when I can work for three days without sleep. There are moments like when I, I cannot do anything for this day.\nI had a very long period without my very small kids. And so when I met in a couple of months, my younger son, so he didn't recognize me. So compared to the people that suffered the atrocities in Bucha or European or Eastern Ukraine, this is nothing. But this wasn't a good experience. \nThe main factor for myself is this feeling of responsibility.\n[Roman Kizyma, to camera] So when you see a bald guy or girl in the hospital, that’s my patient. \nIf I just stop, I compromise the treatment of hundreds of children. And I think I'm not in the position to to end this.\n[Roman Kizyma, in Ukrainian to patient] Where is the problem? Where does it hurt? Show me. \n[Patient] Here. \nRoman Kizyma Here? Ok. \n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian, to patient] Do you want to show me your tongue? Ok.\nMy name is Roman Kizyma. I am pediatric oncologist, a medical doctor treating children with cancer. Now I’m the Acting Director of Western Ukrainian Specialized Children's Medical Center, a huge, specialized hospital for severely ill children with cancer with other catastrophic diseases.\nThe war made the things for children with cancer and other catastrophic disease very difficult. You have to fight two wars, one against cancer, the other against the crazy Russian army shooting at you. It's not only the physical unsafety, it's also the complete disruption at some point of medical logistics. So no drugs coming to the hospital. No doctors or nurses available in the direct hospital. The physical unsafety, the shelling of Ukrainian electricity infrastructure.\nSo sometimes we were black. All the hospital was black. No electricity. \n[Hospital staff, in Ukrainain] And our doctor’s don’t know this but \n[Staff] — Oh everyone’s with flashlights. \n[Hospital Staff singing Ukrainian National Anthem] \nRoman Kizyma This is a vulnerable group of patients. And when there is a kind of crisis, vulnerable group of people suffers the most because no one cares. Everyone trying to save themselves. So that's why a lot of families like asked or decided or went by themselves to Europe with this project that we call Safer Ukraine. \nBefore the war, I was just treating cancer. I transformed into someone coordinating the big groups of very sick children going here and there. So it means like one and a half thousand children out of Ukraine with cancer treated somewhere else. The team is ready to help these children and we have the capacity. So that's why this is a special hospital.\nDuring two years before the start of the war, we were creating the new department, the Clinic of Pediatric oncology and stem cell transplant here in this hospital.We opened this seven days before the start of the war, so we had a huge amount of patients going to be treated there. And we have to transform ourselves from oncologists to emergency doctors and relocate all our patients to to to the other countries.\nSo it was a huge blow for our level of work. And we have to abandon all these new structures that we created because you cannot perform transplants when you are getting shellings and shootings and all these children.\n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian] If not urgent then tomorrow, ok? Ok. If urgent I can look now. Ok. \nI feel so stressed. I feel like in a race against time. The relocation of a child with cancer from Ukraine to Western Europe is not something new. We did that even before the war, but was like a couple of children per year. But how do you do that if you have 100 children with cancer coming to your hospital per night.\nThese are severely ill children. And for each of them you should have a lot of medical staff to support each patient.\n[Nurse, in Ukrainian] Alright. \nThere is no hospital that can treat 1,500 children at one time from some country. So this is not possible, \n[Child, in Ukrainian] It’s cold.\nRoman Kizyma That's why we tried to use different criteria. First of all, we organized multistep approach with different hubs.\nWe got the requests from the families or the doctors from different cities of the east of Ukraine or Kyiv, the capital. The first hub is in Lviv. This hospital that can host any child of any severity. And if they cannot go further, we can treat them here for a long time or for a short time and then allocate them.\nWe created with our partners, with charities or the support for housing and the capacity for transportation. So we had a lot of volunteers meeting children in the railway station, carrying them out of there, carrying 20 patients out of a train in a railway station that is packed with people trying to go somewhere. We went only [as] five doctors to meet a huge convoy at the railway station, so we have to carry kids across the railways.\nThe next step was the hub in Poland. The thing was to cross the border was a lot of queues of people trying desperately to move out of Ukraine. So we used the diplomatic power of Polish consulates situated in Lviv. This was saving time for the severely ill kids because if they stayed for ten or 20 hours in the queue, they would not leave it. So it was possible. \nIn the next hub there was a triage of the international team that came here to Poland and they formed a logistics. A huge hotel was transformed into a medical center in the middle of Poland. Children were arriving there and they were triaged to different rooms and taken care by this group of international doctors.\nThen they contacted their dedicated hospital throughout Europe and U.SA and these hospitals and their government, they were transferring these kids to a specific hospital admitted by their team. In the worst phase, we had more than 150 children per week sent by this pathway. This was very hard. \n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian, to patient] You can pull it up a bit. Good. \nRoman Kizyma My job was not to step into one into one case.\nSo this was I was oncologist myself. So I tried just to not to step in each case more than like 10 minutes. So I used my previous experience to triage them. \n[Roman Kizyma in Ukrainian, to patient.] Good. Can you smile? Can you smile and show your teeth? Good, well done. \nDuring all these relocations, we lost two children. It's Russians who were attacking them, kids were from Kharkiv.\nSo it's very close to the Russian border. That's why during their very severe treatment phase, they had to be evacuated from their hospital, put into ordinary trains and they came to L’viv. Like we literally had no choice. So we had to explain to the families, you decide what you do. You don't go and we stay and try to do something here in L'viv during these air strikes, or you risk.\nBut at least, you know you did everything to a child. So they risked and we failed. So this both children died. Some of their doctors who helped us here, they came from the regions that were under attack. There is a sad story of our colleagues in Kyiv. One of their doctors, she was driving to her shift for the children with cancer.\nShe was hit directly by a Russian rocket in her car and she was burned alive. Her name is Oksana Leontieva. And I think this event, it was very influential. So we realized how dangerous, dangerous the work is. \n[In Ukrainian, singing] Hands made some porridge and gave to Darynka. Running to get some porridge, Yes. \nBut there were a lot of happy situations. And I visited a lot of these hospitals afterwards, like in fall in the winter, that here. And the people were happy. The children were happy. Who are you treating? Sometimes I felt like I was going through a hospital in Europe and like the first room, my patient, the second room, my patient. The third room, my patient.\nSo I was feeling like I'm the part of the staff of that hospital. You were asking me like, What should we do with your patients? So mostly these are the good stories and the feedbacks where like people are very grateful to all these countries because they felt like they were in home. During last year even as a pediatric oncologist, I helped to build the facilities.\nSo I'll try to do that as a director, but not only for pediatric oncology, for example, this will be the intensive care unit, the huge project within this year. So some people like outside of Ukraine, how can you build during the wartime? You can. Why not? The life still goes on and we have to have these places for this severely ill children that will look better.\nSo that's what I am focused now to to do that. This is a network that try to balance itself. So this is a never ending process. I hope this will work.\n[The above is a transcript of this podcast]\nCarin Leong and Kelso Harper\nJonathan Schienberg and Retro Report\nAaron Martin\nDaniel Garisto, Jason Drakeford, Lee Billings and Jeffery DelViscio\nDuy Linh Tu and Sebastian Tuinder\nKit R.

{"title": "New York City's Floods and Torrential Rainfall Explained", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nRecord-breaking rains caused major flash flooding in New York City, reminiscent of Hurricane Ida and a sign of what climate change will increasingly bring\nPhotographs and videos of New York City have shown rainwater spurting from between subway station tiles, cars bobbing in floodwaters that turned Brooklyn intersections into lakes and parts of LaGuardia Airport inundated as the city and surrounding areas have been deluged by heavy downpours on Friday.\nBetween midnight and the afternoon, rainfall rates up to two inches per hour dropped more than five inches of water on Central Park and more than eight inches on John F. Kennedy International Airport—a record for any calendar day in the latter. That precipitation overwhelmed ground that was already well saturated from the previous weekend’s rains (courtesy of the remnants of Tropical Storm Ophelia) and the storm drains and subway pumps used to funnel rainwater away.\nThe rain has been reminiscent of what might happen in a tropical system—and has reminded many New Yorkers of Hurricane Ida’s deadly flooding two years ago—though the exact mechanics were a bit different in this case. Here Scientific American answers some questions readers may have about this and similar events—particularly how climate change comes into play.\nHow does this compare with other major rain events in New York City’s history?\nWe can’t say exactly where this event will rank because the rain is still falling, but comparing it to Ida is not off base. Ida’s peak rainfall rates were higher—about three inches per hour—and it dropped 7.13 inches on September 1, 2021, the worst day of rain during that storm. And though the current storm has caused major flash flooding, “we haven’t seen the catastrophic flash flooding” that happened during Ida and killed 11 people in basement apartments in Queens, says Dominic Ramunni, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Upton, N.Y.\nThis event has dropped more rain than Ida did on JFK Airport, though—it is the most rain the airport has recorded since records began in 1948. Every storm is a little different, and where the heaviest bands of rain form can vary, which means some areas experience higher totals in some storms than in others. “That's why we see this variability from event to event,” Ramunni says.\nHow do you get such a deluge without the involvement of a tropical storm?\nThough tropical cyclones (the broad term for tropical storms, hurricanes and typhoons) are notorious for the torrents of rain they can bring, nontropical systems are capable of causing heavy downpours if they have enough moisture available.\nTropical systems are driven by convection that is fueled by warm ocean waters. They often develop a clear “eye” at their center that is completely surrounded by swirling thunderstorms. That setup has not been present with the system over New York City on Friday.\nRather that system has been driven in part by an area of low pressure to the south of the city that is an offshoot of another, more unusual area of low pressure called an “inverted trough.” In meteorological speak, that means it has caused a northward bulge in the atmosphere instead of a more typical southward one. The whole setup has made moisture-laden air converge and rise upward. As it has risen, the air has cooled and formed clouds and rain. That moisture has been funneled onshore like a hose aimed at the city.\nHow does climate change factor into the situation?\nIt would take a specific study—called an attribution study—to give any hard numbers on how much more likely this event would be with climate change than without it. But broadly speaking, scientists know that rising global temperatures are making heavy downpours more likely.\nThe 2018 National Climate Assessment (a new version of which is due sometime this year) found that the amount of rain that fell during the heaviest 1 percent of rain events had increased by 55 percent across the Northeast since 1958, with most of the increase happening since 1996. That trend will only get worse as global temperature rise, causing more evaporation from oceans and lakes and giving storms more water to fuel deluges.\nHow can I stay more aware of pending storms and flooding threats?\nRamunni says that having more than one source for receiving extreme weather alerts is ideal. These resources can include alerts that government agencies send out to your phone, local news and a weather radio.\nWhen forecasters issue a watch for a flood (or other type of weather event such as a tornado), it indicates that people should be prepared for those conditions in their area. If a warning is issued, that means they should take immediate action.\nIn the case of floods, one of the biggest warnings meteorologists give is to never, ever drive into floodwaters, even if they don't seem very deep. Just six inches of water can reach the bottom of the average passenger car and cause loss of control, and only a foot of water can float many vehicles.\nCould this event have been even worse?\nAmazingly, yes. Meteorologist Mark Bove noted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the highest rains from the storm occurred just offshore and totaled more than 8.5 inches. If that had fallen over the city, it would have been “the worst #flooding disaster the city has ever experienced,” he wrote.\nAndrea Thompson, an associate editor at Scientific American, covers sustainability. Follow Andrea Thompson on Twitter Credit: Nick Higgins\nMeghan Bartels\nThomas Frank and E&E News\nJaney Camp and The Conversation US\nOliver Wing, Carolyn Kousky, Jeremy Porter, Paul Bates and The Conversation US\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Government Shutdown Looms over Scientists", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nA government shutdown would disrupt biomedical research and clinical trials as federal experimental facilities shuttered\nFuelled by infighting among Republicans in the House of Representatives over spending cuts, the United States is barreling towards a government shutdown. Lawmakers in the US Congress have until 30 September (the end of the fiscal year) to reach an agreement over how to keep money flowing to federal agencies, or the government will have to close many of its doors and furlough staff — including tens of thousands of scientists — without pay. Depending on how long the shutdown lasts, work at science agencies will stop, interrupting experiments, delaying the approval of research grants and halting travel to scientific conferences.\nThe shutdown drama is unfolding in the House, where the Republican party holds a narrow majority. A handful of extreme right-wing Republicans are refusing to support a ‘continuing resolution’ to fund the government temporarily while negotiations over a 2024 budget continue — that is, unless Congress agrees to drastically cut government spending, among other demands. Democrats are united in opposition to their requests, and most Republicans in both the House and the Democrat-controlled Senate are looking for compromise that would keep the government open. But time is running out.\nHere Nature takes a look at what’s driving this latest budgetary crisis, and what’s in store for scientists if the US government shuts down next week.\nThis is basically a continuation of the US debt-ceiling crisis, which occurred less than four months ago. At that time, some Republicans threatened to block legislation that would make sure the government had enough money to pay its bills, unless Democrats, including President Joe Biden, agreed to future spending cuts. Congress avoided disaster by reaching a bipartisan agreement to limit federal ‘discretionary’ spending — money that goes to US science and other programmes. The legislation, which broadly outlined reductions in spending over the next two years, was signed by Biden on 3 June.\nSince then, lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have gone about their business with unusual efficiency, making progress on a series of annual bills that outline detailed spending levels for federal agencies. The irony is that lawmakers haven’t made this much progress by the fiscal-year deadline in a long time, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), based in Rockville, Maryland. “And yet here we are, staring down the barrel of another shutdown.”\nNormally, Congress would pass a resolution to continue funding agencies for a couple of months while lawmakers finish up budget negotiations, but the situation is different this year. Republicans hold only a narrow majority in the House, occupying 222 seats, compared with the Democrats’ 213. That means that to pass legislation, the Republican party needs to maintain a united front and vote nearly in unison, to overcome Democratic opposition. Several hardline Republicans are holding out, however, using their leverage to force further concessions on spending.\nThe answer differs from agency to agency. Some agencies have residual funds that they can tap to continue operating in the short term. And to varying degrees, all agencies maintain a skeleton staff of ‘essential’ workers to complete duties related to national security and the protection of public property, for instance.\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF), expects to halt work for 1,487 out of its 1,946 employees, once short-term funding runs out, for example. Scientists can continue to submit applications for funding to the agency, which pays for about one-quarter of the taxpayer-supported basic research in the United States, but no new projects will be approved. The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the US National Institutes of Health, a significant funder of biomedical research, plans to furlough some 37,325 people — 42% of its staff — by the second day of a shutdown. ‘Essential’ staff working at its clinical centre or on public-safety missions such as monitoring for viral outbreaks will continue to report to work.\nGovernment scientists will have access to laboratories for the maintenance of equipment, cell cultures and animals, but research will mostly grind to a halt, says Joanne Carney, chief government-relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC.\nIf the shutdown drags on, she says, it could have knock-on effects for scientists outside of government, who might lose access to federally funded experimental facilities or be forced to delay hiring for projects while awaiting grant decisions. Scientists witnessed such impacts in late 2018 and early 2019, when the US government partially shut down for 35 days.\n“It does create a ripple effect into the research community outside the federal government,” Carney says.\nMichael Moloney, chief executive officer of the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland, says US shutdowns can also impact international collaborations and the country’s reputation abroad. He is attending the International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijan, next week, and fears that scientists from NASA will now have to cancel their attendance. “That may not have any immediate short-term impact, but it does chip away at our reputation as a global player,” he says.\nTo end a shutdown, Congress would need to pass a continuing resolution that enables the government to fund activities for weeks or months while lawmakers finish passing bills locking in the 2024 budget. According to Zeitzer, one natural landing place in terms of budget negotiations is where everything started: with the broad spending limits laid out in the debt-ceiling agreement cemented back in June.\nThe impacts of such a move would vary by agency, but Zeitzer says many agency leaders are probably already preparing for some tough budgetary decisions next year. This is one of those years where no increase — but also no decrease — in funding will be “the good scenario,” she says.\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on September 28, 2023.\nJeff Tollefson works for Nature magazine.\n\nJean Chemnick and E&E News\nThomas Frank and E&E News\nThomas Frank and E&E News\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Government Shutdown Could Delay Climate Action", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nEPA rules on clean cars, power plants and methane could face delays if there is a federal government shutdown because of budget turmoil in Congress\nCLIMATEWIRE | EPA was already facing a mad dash to complete climate rules in the next six months. A government shutdown could make that harder.\nThe agency has run behind schedule to propose and finalize regulations throughout the Biden administration, and the government's looming closure threatens to make it harder for the agency to complete work on key pieces of the president’s climate agenda before they may become vulnerable to Republican-led reversals.\nThe administration’s regulatory agenda in June projected that the Office of Air and Radiation would clear a slate of methane-related actions over the summer, including a final oil and gas rule and a proposed fee on excess emissions envisioned in last year’s climate law. Neither has begun White House review.\nEPA also expected to finish work on rules for passenger vehicle and heavy-duty truck emissions before the end of this year. While the truck rule is expected to hit that mark, EPA has said the clean car rule won't be ready until the spring. And the agency's marquee rule for power plant carbon emissions is projected to be final in April.\nIf EPA sticks to its current schedule, that should prevent Republicans from using the Congressional Review Act to undo those rules in one fell blow if they win control of both congressional chambers and the White House in next year's elections. But experts say a government shutdown could delay the rulemaking process. The CRA sets a strict window based on the congressional calendar allowing lawmakers to pass — and the president to sign — a resolution to veto a newly minted rule. It's not clear when that window will close next year, but the later the rule is final the more it is at risk.\nIf Congress fails to pass a funding bill by Saturday at midnight, EPA has said it has cash on hand to stay open through Oct. 7. Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said in an email to staff first reported by POLITICO that if Congress still hadn’t passed government funding legislation by next Friday, “most EPA employees” will be furloughed.\nAnd that could cost the agency more productivity than the length of the shutdown would suggest, say former EPA officials.\n“If the shutdown is one week, it's more than one week that they're going to lose on the rulemaking process,” said Bob Perciasepe, a former EPA deputy administrator who has experienced three government shutdowns. “It's already eroding their effectiveness, I'm guessing, right now.\"\nThe looming shutdown also raises the prospects of other interruptions that could grind agency work to a halt. Online portals that are used to submit grant applications and to comment on EPA actions might close, requiring extensions. And outside contractors that EPA relies on for some of its economic modeling and analysis related to rulemakings could take other work.\nExisting laws do allow EPA to carry on with some activities if appropriations lapse. The agency's 2-year-old contingency plan outlines those exceptions — including allowing work to continue if it's related to court-ordered deadlines, securing EPA facilities or protecting “life and property.” The plan points to the example of responding to the release of hazardous substances when it endangers public health.\nCongress enacted climate and infrastructure legislation over the last two years that provides funding outside of the regular appropriations process — and that work can continue during a government shutdown. But money from the Inflation Reduction Act probably can’t be used to continue EPA regulatory work, experts say.\nStan Meiburg, who served at EPA for nearly 40 years including a stint as acting deputy administrator, said rules that are already under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget likely face the thorniest shutdown-related delays.\n“With major rules in particular there'd have been a lot of discussion going on between OMB and EPA before they send the rule over there, and they have it pretty well laid out as to what their schedule is and what they were expecting to do,” he said. “If you can't get it out of OMB, though, you start to get day-to-day extensions of where and when the actual release is going to be.”\nThe EPA air office has a handful of rules currently under White House review, including one that would guide state plans to implement the power plant carbon rule and the oil and gas methane rule. The methane rule is expected to go to OMB any day, observers say.\nEPA released draft methane rules during the last two global climate summits, and the final version might be unveiled at the talks that start in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in November. But interagency review typically takes at least two months, so a government shutdown of any length would make that timing unlikely.\nMeiburg said a shutdown that causes short-term delays for some rules would be unlikely to create a long-term backup that could affect the clean car and power plant rules expected in the spring.\n\"Usually the agency can do a certain amount of scrambling around to just kind of make up some time,” he said. OMB might also work to complete reviews more quickly.\nReporter Kevin Bogardus contributed.\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC. Copyright 2023.

{"title": "Controversy Surrounds Blockbuster Superconductivity Claim", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nWill a possible breakthrough for room-temperature superconducting materials hold up to scrutiny?\nEditor’s Note (9/29/23): This article from March 10 reported on a study claiming the discovery of room-temperature superconducting material that was published in Nature. Earlier this week the Wall Street Journal reported that nearly three quarters of that paper’s co-authors had contacted the publisher to ask that the study be retracted because it had flaws. Nature confirmed that it is in contact with this group and plans to take action.\nThis week researchers claimed to have discovered a superconducting material that can shuttle electricity with no loss of energy under near-real-world conditions. But drama and controversy behind the scenes have many worried that the breakthrough may not hold up to scientific scrutiny.\n“If you were to find a room-temperature, room-pressure superconductor, you’d have a completely new host of technologies that would occur—that we haven’t even begun to dream about,” says Eva Zurek, a computational chemist at the University at Buffalo, who was not involved in the new study. “This could be a real game changer if it turns out to be correct.”\nScientists have been studying superconductors for more than a century. By carrying electricity without shedding energy in the form of heat, these materials could make it possible to create incredibly efficient power lines and electronics that never overheat. Superconductors also repel magnetic fields. This property lets researchers levitate magnets over a superconducting material as a fun experiment—and it could also lead to more efficient high-speed maglev trains. Additionally, these materials could produce super strong magnets for use in wind turbines, portable magnetic resonance imaging machines or even nuclear fusion power plants.\nThe only superconducting materials previously discovered require extreme conditions to function, which makes them impractical for many real-world applications. The first known superconductors had to be cooled with liquid helium to temperatures only a few degrees above absolute zero. In the 1980s researchers found superconductivity in a category of materials called cuprates, which work at higher temperatures yet still require cooling with liquid nitrogen. Since 2015 scientists have measured room-temperature superconductive behavior in hydrogen-rich materials called hydrides. but they have to be pressed in a sophisticated viselike instrument called a diamond anvil cell until they reach a pressure of about a quarter to half of that found near the center of Earth.\nThe new material, called nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride, is a blend of hydrogen, the rare-earth metal lutetium and nitrogen. Although this material also relies on a diamond anvil cell, the study found that it begins exhibiting superconductive behavior at a pressure of about 10,000 atmospheres—roughly 100 times lower than the pressures that other hydrides require. The new material is “much closer to ambient pressure than previous materials,” says David Ceperley, a condensed matter physicist at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not involved in the new study. He also notes that the material remains stable when stored at a room pressure of one atmosphere. “Previous stuff was only stable at a million atmospheres, so you couldn’t really take it out of the diamond anvil” cell, he says. “The fact that it’s stable at one atmosphere of pressure, that also means that it’d be easier to manufacture.”\nHydrogen is key to the new material’s superconducting ability and to that of any hydride. In the 1960s researchers first calculated that the metallic form of this element might be a superconductor. The idea is that superconductivity occurs when electrons pair up and form a new state of matter and that this could happen in the soup of electrons that surrounds a metal’s nuclei—particularly when those nuclei belong to ultralight hydrogen atoms. Unfortunately, making those atoms shift their phase from gas to metal would require extreme pressure—about one and a half times greater than pressures at the center of this planet. But if a hydrogen atom is combined with one or two other elements in the form of a hydride, researchers think the other atoms would compress the hydrogen, allowing it to attain a metallic state at lower, much more easily obtainable pressures. “We wanted to find the right rare-earth material to mimic these same metallic hydrogen properties as much lower pressures. So that’s where the lutetium metal came into the picture,” says study co-author Ranga Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester. “And then the use of nitrogen is to stabilize these structures.”\nThe material, described in a Nature paper published this week, could raise hopes for other hydrides that lower the pressure requirements still further. Unfortunately, the work is dogged by controversy over previous papers by Dias and study co-author Ashkan Salamat, a physicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “There are two approaches possible. One is just ignore the past and look at this paper and just see what it is,” says Dirk van der Marel, a professor emeritus at the University of Geneva, who was not involved in the new study. “And if I do that, then it is a great paper.” The authors, he notes, used multiple tests of superconductivity, which provided an “extraordinary richness of data.” But van der Marel does not automatically trust these data, in part because of his experience analyzing previous work from the same authors.\nIn 2020 Dias, Salamat and their colleagues published a Nature paper describing room-temperature superconductivity in a different material, called carbonaceous sulfur hydride. Jorge Hirsch, a physicist at University of California, San Diego, questioned the appearance of data demonstrating the extent to which the material could become magnetized, referred to as its “magnetic susceptibility,” and called on the authors to release their raw data. This measurement is important because it indicates one sign of a superconductor: the ability to expel a magnetic field, a phenomenon called the Meissner effect. Because this measurement must be made while the superconducting hydride is in a diamond anvil cell, results contain background noise. To remove that noise, researchers take a separate measurement of the background and subtract it from the raw data to give the final magnetic susceptibility value. Dias and Salamat pushed back against Hirsch’s claims and eventually released the requested data. Hirsch and van der Marel worked together to analyze those data and concluded they had been processed in an unconventional way at best or had been manipulated at worst. Dias and Salamat contend that their processing method had been misunderstood.\nThe controversy drove Nature to retract the 2020 paper in 2022, a decision to which all its authors objected. Dias and Salamat say they stand by their results, and two investigations by the University of Rochester, where Dias works, found no wrongdoing. The authors also say they have rerun the original experiments at two different Department of Energy labs with outside observers present and that this effort verified the original results. “Time is a great peer-review process,” Salamat says. Dias says the researchers have updated their original paper as a preprint and resubmitted it to Nature. Other labs, however, have not been able to replicate the original results independently. But it can take a long time for a lab to reproduce and then test a specific material. The drawn out conflict has involved the release of multiple preprints, with neither side accepting the other’s arguments. And it eventually became so acrimonious that administrators of the preprint server arXiv.org removed papers from both parties and put Hirsch under a temporary publishing ban, which he objected to. “My papers analyzed the data and pointed out inconsistencies,” he says.\nHirsch previously earned a reputation as an outspoken critic of superconductivity research, but he and van der Marel were not the only researchers to investigate these authors. In addition to looking at magnetic susceptibility, James Hamlin, a physicist at the University of Florida, examined the electrical resistance data from the 2020 Nature paper. When a material reaches a superconducting state, its electrical resistance drops to zero. The measurement of this phenomenon does not require any processing to remove background noise like the magnetic susceptibility data do. Yet Hamlin notes that even the resistance data appeared to have undergone this processing, which was not disclosed in the paper. He finds Dias’s and Salamat’s responses to be insufficient explanations of these discrepancies. “They’ve kind of muddied the waters by publishing these things that have the appearance of a scientific argument,” Hamlin says. “But if you actually examine their response..., it just holds no water. And it does not address the concerns” raised by other researchers.\nHamlin went on to analyze a paper that Dias and Salamat published in Physical Review Letters (PRL) in 2021 in which they and their colleagues measured another hydride called manganese sulfide. Hamlin noted similarities between the electrical resistance data in the 2021 paper and those in Dias’s 2013 Ph.D. thesis, which had involved a completely different superconducting material. He shared these concerns with the journal and the paper’s authors. Salamat has since responded, suggesting that even though the two data sets may appear similar, the resemblance is not indicative of copied data. “We’ve shown that if you just overlay other people’s data qualitatively, a lot of things look the same,” he says. “This is a very unfair approach.”\nThis did not satisfy at least one of Salamat’s co-authors on the PRL paper: Simon A. J. Kimber, a former researcher, was disturbed to hear about the potential problem with the data and agrees with Hamlin’s conclusions. “I’ve been at this game for a long time, and I couldn’t think of a single reasonable explanation as to why those data sets should overlap like that,” he says. “I replied to everybody, to PRL’s editors, and said, ‘I think this should be retracted. I can’t think of any logical reason why this should be—retract, retract, retract.’” According to Jessica Thomas, executive editor at the journal’s publisher, the American Physical Society, editors are currently investigating these claims. “We take allegations of data fabrication very seriously,” she says. “At the same time, professional reputations are at stake, and we have to gather information thoughtfully and accurately. We also strive to ensure that the exchanges remain professional and respectful.”\nGiven the past controversies, Dias and Salamat took pains to test the new material thoroughly for their new paper, performing three different categories of experiments that suggest superconductivity had occurred. “The key fields that you wanted to provide, in order to prove superconductivity, is electrical resistance goes to zero, magnetic susceptibility—which is a demonstration of this expelling the magnetic fields—and heat capacity measurements. These are three different directions,” Dias says. “In this paper, our group has done all three measurements, including submeasurements,” such as two different measurements of magnetic susceptibility for both continuous and fluctuating fields.\nThe new paper also provides a “recipe” for other researchers who want to synthesize the new hydride and test it themselves, but the authors have not shared existing samples of the material. They are co-founding a start-up called Unearthly Materials to commercialize room-temperature superconductors and say they do not wish to reveal their intellectual property. “We have incredibly clear, detailed instructions on how to make these materials, like all of our studies. We just ask that the groups that are in denial ... go through the protocols themselves,” Salamat says. “We’re excited to see other groups replicate and push forward the field of high-temperature superconductivity.” Some researchers, such as Kimber, have stated they would not devote time and resources to replicating the results because they do not trust the new paper. But other superconducting labs may make the attempt.\nIf they do succeed at replicating these results, they could open up fascinating new lines of research. For instance, the exact structure of the new material is not yet fully understood. Salamat has used imaging methods that reveal where the heavy lutetium atoms are within the compound, but the team isn’t yet certain about the configuration of the lighter hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. The material also contains relatively little hydrogen, even though this is the substance that theoretically gives hydrides their superconducting ability. Multiple researchers, including Zurek and Ceperley, were intrigued by this contradiction. It could point to alternate theories for how superconductivity arises in hydride materials.\nThe big claims made in this paper, as well as past controversies, have raised the bar for proof, says Michael Norman, group leader of the condensed matter theory group at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, who was not involved in the new study. But a reluctance to trust results until they are replicated is not unusual in the field of superconductivity. He points to the 1986 discovery of cuprates, which were found to be superconducting at much higher temperatures than previous materials. After it was published, “over the first six months, people pretty much didn’t pay the paper much attention. But then when the result was reproduced by a Japanese group, that’s sort of when everybody jumped into the field,” Norman says. As for the new study, “I’m pretty sure that people will be cautiously optimistic until they see another group reproduce it.”\nSophie Bushwick is an associate editor covering technology at Scientific American.

{"title": "Eaten, Crushed or Starved; Male Tarantulas Trade Their Life to Impregnate a Mate", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nAfter eight years maturing in a burrow, male tarantulas venture out to mate, then die a cruel death\nOn an early evening in September, 16 dark, hairy legs were kicking up dust on the prairie floor in La Junta, Colo. A male Oklahoma brown tarantula was locked in a heated mating match with a female twice his age. Although weary, he plunged a set of hooks that had recently grown on his front legs into his mate’s mouth, just below her glossy fangs, to prevent her from chewing him up.\nThe intense ritual was taking place across the arid grasslands of southeastern Colorado, where the tarantula mating season spans September. Female tarantulas can live multiple decades and never travel more than a few inches from their burrows. Males mature in seven to 10 years, and when they finally venture beyond their burrows, they have only one goal—mate—and then their life’s job is done.\n“They weren’t evolved to survive,” says entomologist Maia Holmes, education and outreach coordinator at the department of agricultural biology at Colorado State University. “They are at the end of their life cycles, and this is their last hurrah.” Similar fates await male tarantulas in other western U.S. states, in Central and South America, and around the world.\nUsing a specialized appendage near his mouth called a pedipalp, the male spider reached forward and carefully slid a packet of sperm into the female’s abdominal cavity. The package contained enough sperm to fertilize upward of 1,500 eggs. Typically only a few spiders from a clutch of hundreds survive into adulthood; offspring only need to replace their parents to sustain a population.\nOnce our male—let’s call him Spiderman—carefully extracted his hooks from his mate’s fangs, he dropped to the ground and scurried backward while the female was still reared up like a horse on her hind legs. All tarantulas are nearly blind their whole life, so he was fleeing by feel.\nSpiderman might have tried to mate again, if he could summon the energy. But in the following weeks only one thing was certain: he would perish. Spiderman didn’t die like his father may have: eaten head-first by his female mate. Both ravenous and bold, the mother would strike the father’s head with her venom as soon as he finished gifting his sperm and immediately take a bite from his left “temple.” Spiderman had picked a mate who, luckily for him, had recently eaten.\nOur protagonist didn’t die like his brother may have either. The sibling, let’s call him Brother, was taken captive by a tarantula hawk, a massive spider wasp that grows to two inches long. Tarantula hawks are pollinators, sampling nectar from flowering plants, but when it’s time to raise their young, the females of the species take on a different demeanor.\nBrother had just stopped to rest on a quiet patch of dirt when he was attacked. For several minutes the wasp circled him, flitting in and out with the agile prodding of a fencer. Brother did what most tarantulas do when they feel threatened: he froze. The wasp turned upside down and maneuvered under Brother’s abdomen to search for a soft spot, like a mechanic sliding under the chassis of a car, and injected his paralyzing venom there.\nThe tarantula hawk dragged his paralyzed but living prey into Brother’s own den and laid a single egg on his abdomen. Over the next couple of weeks, the egg hatched, and the developing insect that emerged ate its way through Brother’s tissues, saving vital organs for last so that he stayed alive and fresh, though starved, for as long as possible.\nFortunately, Spiderman also didn’t die like any number of his cousins—crushed by a semitruck while scrambling across a street in search of a mate. Moments before they die this way, the poor-sighted tarantulas can sense a vehicle’s vibrations through their highly sensitive paws on the pavement, but by then it’s too late. And as habitat fragmentation continues, and humans’ footprint on the landscape widens, this fate will become increasingly common.\nOur Spiderman died a slower death. After mating, he lost interest in food. He became weak because the majority of his energy reserves went to sperm production. He managed to avoid tarantula hawks and roads. But as he continued to lose energy, his body became slower, more rigid. The blood pressure generated from his heartbeat slowed, causing his legs to curl inward—what’s known in the spider world as the “death curl.” It was also time for him to molt his exoskeleton, an impossible feat that sealed his fate. “Molting is like pulling yourself from a suit of armor without using your hands,” Holmes says. “And for a male spider who has mated, his hooks and reproductive parts prevent his molt from sliding off. They get stuck.”\nAs the hours went on, Spiderman twitched less. He stopped fighting. And as he lay there, curled up beside a halo of small yellow flowers—perhaps the very flowers pollinated by the wasp that killed his brother—he had no idea of the impact he had on the world. He had no idea that his position as a key predator in his ecosystem helped manage its insect population, no idea that his eight-legged form inspired robotic technology and innovations in artificial webbing and no idea of the future that a changing planet might have in store for his descendants.\nResearchers are trying to understand what climate change might do to tarantula populations. As temperatures warm, and flowers’ growing season extends later into the year, the pollinating tarantula hawks might be out later. Male tarantulas might be mating at a time when more wasps—more threats—are around, explains Richard Reading, vice president of science and conservation at an invertebrate zoo called the Butterfly Pavilion in Denver and an adjunct professor at the University of Denver. “Tarantulas also have a mechanical system to their movement; heat impacts that, too,” Reading says.\nBack in La Junta, Spiderman’s own mechanics were failing. In these final moments, his partially shed exoskeleton blocked his book lungs—delicate, platelike structures that allowed air to enter his body passively. He was running out of energy and now oxygen. But just moments before he faded away, a bushy-tailed Swift Fox no bigger than a house cat swiped him up and gobbled him.\nIn these grasslands, tarantulas are both prey for numerous species and top predators, crucial to keeping the insect populations at bay and the ecology in balance. “All creatures serve a purpose in the web of life. Every species contributes to the stability of an ecosystem,” Reading says.\nThe fox wandered into the night as the sun set over the dusty hills of La Junta, perhaps trotting over the very burrow that housed the female who now held the future of Spiderman’s bloodline. As humans, we often anthropomorphize the animal kingdom, and some of us may feel pity for our central character. But “there are no good guys or bad guys in nature–it’s all interconnected,” Holmes says. “Everything needs to exist for everything else to exist.”\nKatie Weeman is a science writer based in Denver, Colo., and communications director at the Colorado Water Conservation Board.

{"title": "Stop Trying to 'Find' Your Passion--There's a Better Way to Love What You Do", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nRecognizing that interests are malleable and can be developed can make us more resilient, open and creative\n“Find your passion!” Whether we hear it from our parents, teachers, bosses or college commencement speakers, this injunction is woven into the fabric of American culture. It is well-intended and meant to inspire. But is it good advice?\n“Finding” a passion implies that it already exists fully formed and is simply waiting to be discovered. Unfortunately, this idea doesn’t square with what science tells us. Instead passions, like interests, are developed. They often begin with a spark of curiosity caused by something in one’s environment, such as a fascinating physics lecture or a moving piece of art. Through a process involving repeated engagement, positive experiences and accrued knowledge, people can come to personally value that content or activity and internalize it. What was at first interesting becomes an interest. If these qualities continue to intensify, a passion can emerge.\nIn several studies, we and our colleagues have found that misunderstanding this idea can hold people back. Assuming passions are immutable and essential—rather than something to cultivate and build—can cause people to be less open to different topics, less resilient to challenges in pursuit of new interests and less creative when problem-solving. Fortunately, our latest research reveals that there are ways to correct course and cultivate a more open, accurate perspective about interest.\nTo study these ideas, we use a framework of “fixed” and “growth” mindsets, which may be familiar from educational research. In school, conceiving of one’s intellectual abilities as fixed can be detrimental, whereas believing one can develop and grow skills supports greater learning. We argue that encouraging people to “find” their passion may cause them to eventually believe that interests and passions are inherent and relatively unchangeable. People who think this have a fixed mindset of interest. By contrast, some people, whom we refer to as having a growth mindset of interest, view their interests and passions as developed.\nOur work has revealed that fixed and growth mindsets about interest are distinct from fixed and growth mindsets surrounding intellectual abilities. We have also repeatedly found that a growth mindset of interest comes with many advantages. People with a fixed mindset of interest, for example, may fall into the trap of thinking, “If I have already found my passion, why keep exploring?” In our studies, after engaging in a new science task, arts students with a fixed mindset expressed less interest in that scientific topic than arts students with a growth mindset. Meanwhile science students with a fixed mindset responded similarly to an art-related task. For those with a growth mindset, having a strong pre-existing interest in the arts or sciences did not preclude them from viewing a new area as interesting.\nIn addition, people with a fixed mindset of interest tend to expect their passions to provide limitless motivation, such that their favorite topics should never feel too difficult or demanding. In one study we tested this idea by sparking people’s interest in a topic that was new for them—the science of black holes—with a fun, easy-to-understand animated video about Stephen Hawking’s theories. But when we next asked our participants to read a dense and complex article on black holes from a scientific journal, people with a fixed mindset were frustrated by the technical reading and came to dislike the topic. Meanwhile those with a growth mindset maintained their newfound interest despite the difficulty.\nA fixed mindset of interest can also inhibit creativity and innovation. If people believe they are limited to only a few inherent interests and, in consequence, do not explore other areas, they may miss seeing important connections across different domains. When we recruited undergraduates who identified as either an “arts person” or a “sciences person,” we found that those with a fixed mindset were less likely than those with a growth mindset to generate novel solutions—for example, ideas for new university programs—that integrated the arts and sciences. In other words, seeing interests as fixed stymied their creative potential. That loss is especially unfortunate when we consider how leaders at innovative companies have long prized problem-solving that melds ideas from diverse disciplines and brings together science, technology, art and the humanities.\nSo can a growth mindset of interest be taught? In June we published findings from an intervention that succeeded in that aim. In two studies involving more than 700 first-year liberal arts undergraduates in total, we began by assessing how our participants saw themselves. The majority held strong interests in the arts, humanities and social sciences. Moreover, most reported that they were not a “math-and-science person.” We then randomly assigned students to either our intervention or a study skills module. Both programs were online and took most students less than half an hour to complete during their university orientation week.\nOur intervention included reading and reflective writing activities that helped students think about interests and passions as cultivated rather than as simply found and fixed. For example, the students read a short article that presented research on the benefits of viewing interests as developable. They also wrote a paragraph about an occasion when they developed interest in a new activity. We were careful to present this material in a neutral way—not as a corrective of their current behavior but rather as part of an exercise by their college to better support students’ transition to college. The study skills module had a similar set of exercises but with an emphasis on building classic skills, such as time management and active learning.\nImportantly, these students were required to take at least one math and science course during their first year. That meant we could check how the intervention may have influenced their perspectives on math and science. By the end of the year, students who had received the intervention were more interested in their required math and science courses than those who received the study skills module—and this boost was particularly apparent among students who initially reported that they were not a “math-and-science person.” They also earned better grades in those courses than their counterparts who had received the study skills module. These students, who might have otherwise eschewed these disciplines, became more skilled in math and science and grew into interdisciplinary scholars.\nAlthough our intervention offers a way for schools to support students in cultivating a growth mindset, we believe people can do a lot independently to embrace this way of thinking. First, realize that your interests and passions aren’t pre-existing and waiting to be “found.” Take an active role in developing your passions. Indulge your curiosities, get involved, and don’t expect that pursuing new interests will always be easy or exciting. If you’re a parent, teacher or boss, consider how you might foster a growth mindset of interest in others. Create opportunities for them to pursue their curiosities and interests and engender a culture that rewards exploration; the seeds of passion cannot grow in infertile soil. Of course, exploration can at times lead to failure or disappointment, so communicating that such negative experiences are normal will help others stay motivated through challenges. Finally, consider how you phrase feedback. When someone expresses waning interest in a novel task, signal that interests can develop with time and engagement.\nOf course, not every activity will become a burning passion. But a growth mindset of interest will help you remain open and curious. The old saying “find something you love to do, and you’ll never have to work a day in your life” needs to be updated. The science tells us we should instead work toward loving what we do. We might expand our horizons and become more creative and resilient as a result.\nAre you a scientist who specializes in neuroscience, cognitive science or psychology?

{"title": "What Humans Lose When AI Writes for Us", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nIn Who Wrote This? linguist Naomi S. Baron discusses how artificial intelligence threatens our ability to express ourselves\nArtificial intelligence has pervaded much of our daily life, whether it’s in the form of scarily believable deepfakes, online news containing “written by AI” taglines or novel tools that could diagnose health conditions. It can feel like everything we do is run through some sort of software, interpreted by some mysterious program and kept on a server who knows where. When will the robots take over already? Have they already taken over?\nThe recent developments in AI offer existential questions we’ve been wrestling with since we put pen to proverbial paper: Who wrote this, and can I trust it? Fake news is old news, but some still argue over whether Shakespeare existed or represented multiple authors. Large language models (LLMs) are combinations of authors, each with their own style, voice and expertise. If the generative AI program ChatGPT keeps trying—and we keep feeding it Shakespeare—will it write our next great tragedy?\nLinguist Naomi S. Baron of American University has been wading in the AI waters for years. In her latest book, Who Wrote This? How AI and the Lure of Efficiency Threaten Human Writing, she dives into the crux of the matter: If we hand over the written word to AI, what will we lose? Scientific American spoke with Baron on the issue of the ownership and trustworthiness of written communication now that AI is on the scene.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nDid you use ChatGPT to write any of this book?\nSort of but just a smidge. I completed Who Wrote This? in mid-November 2022, two weeks before ChatGPT burst on the scene. It was a no-brainer that I needed to incorporate something about the new wonder bot.\nMy solution was to query ChatGPT about the intersection of this cutting-edge form of AI with issues such as creativity, education and copyright. In the book, I quote some of ChatGPT’s responses.\nWhen I asked ChatGPT if it could hold copyright on short stories that it authored, the answer was “no” the first time I asked and “yes” the second. The discrepancy reflected the particular part of the dataset that the program dipped into. For the “no” answer, ChatGPT informed me that as an LLM, it was “not capable of holding copyrights or owning any form of intellectual property.”\nBy U.S. copyright law, that’s true. But for the “yes” response, the bot invoked other aspects of U.S. copyright: “In order for a work to be protected by copyright, it must be original and fixed in a tangible form, such as being written down or recorded. If a short story written by GPT meets these criteria, [ChatGPT said], then it would be eligible for copyright protection.\nConsistency is the hobgoblin of large language models.\nWhen thinking about AI-written news, is it all just a snake eating its own tail? Is AI writing just fodder to train other AIs on?\nYou’re right. The only thing relevant to a large language dataset is having text to consume. AI isn’t sentient, and it’s incapable of caring about the source.\nBut what happens to human communication when it’s my bot talking to your bot? Microsoft, Google and others are building out AI-infused e-mail functions that increasingly “read” what’s in our inbox and then draft replies for us. Today’s AI tools can learn your writing style and produce a reasonable facsimile of what you might have written yourself.\nMy concern is that it’s all too tempting to yield to such wiles in the name of saving time and minimizing effort. Whatever else makes us human, the ability to use words and grammar for expressing our thoughts and feelings is a critical chunk of that essence.\nIn your book, you write, “We domesticate technology.” But what does that “domestication” look like for AI?\nThink about our canine companions. They descended from wolves, and it took many years, plus evolution, for some of their species to evolve into dogs, to be domesticated.\nSocial scientists talk about “domestication” of technology. Forty years ago personal computers were novelties. Now they’re ubiquitous, as are software programs running on them. Even Wikipedia—once seen as a dubious information source—has become domesticated.\nWe take editing tools such as spell-check and autocomplete and predictive texting for granted. The same goes for translation programs. What remains to be seen is how domesticated we will make text-generation programs, such as ChatGPT, that create documents out of whole virtual cloth.\nHow has your understanding of AI and LLMs changed how you read and approach writing?\nWhat a difference three years makes! For my own writing, I remain old-fashioned. I sometimes still draft by hand. By contrast, in my role as a university professor, I’ve changed how I approach students’ written work. In years past I assumed the text was their own—not so today. With AI-infused editing and style programs such as Microsoft Editor or Grammarly, not to mention full-blown text-generation tools, at students’ beck and call, I no longer know who wrote what.\nWhat are the AI programs that you feel are the least threatening, or that you think should be embraced?\nAI’s writing ability is an incredible tour de force. But like the discovery of fire, we must figure out how best to harness it. Given the novelty of current programs, it will take at least several years to feel our way.\nToday’s translation programs, while not perfect, are remarkably good, and the benefit is that everyday users who don’t know a language can get immediate access to documents they would have no other way of reading. Of course, a potential drawback is losing motivation for learning foreign languages.\nAnother promising use of generative AI is for editing human-generated text. I’m enthusiastic when AI becomes a pedagogical tool but less so when it simply mops up after the writer, with no lessons learned. It’s on users to be active participants in the composition process.\nAs you say in your book, there is a risk of valuing the speed and potential efficiency of ChatGPT over the development of human skills. With the benefit of spell-check, we can lose our own spelling proficiency. What do you think we’ll similarly lose first from ChatGPT’s ability to write legal documents, e-mails or even news articles?\nAs I argue in my book, the journalism business will likely feel the effects on employment numbers, though I’m not so much worried about the writing skills of the journalists who remain.\nE-mails are a more nuanced story. On the one hand, if you use Microsoft Outlook or Gmail, you’ve already been seeing a lot of autocomplete when you write e-mails. On the other hand, the new versions of AI (think of GPT-4) are writing entire e-mails on their own. It can now literally be my bot writing to your bot. I worry that the likes of ChatGPT will lull us into not caring about crafting our own messages, in our own voice, with our own sentiments, when writing to people who are personally important to us.\nWhat do you think of the recent and potential copyright infringement cases involving authors or publishers and ChatGPT?\nThe copyright infringement cases are interesting because we really are in uncharted territory. You’ll remember the case of the The Authors Guild v. Google, where the guild claimed Google Books enabled copyright infringement when it digitized books without permission and then displayed snippets. After many years of litigation, Google won ... under the ruling of fair use.\nFrom what I’ve been reading from lawyers who are copyright experts, I suspect that OpenAI [the company that developed ChatGPT] will end up winning as well. But here’s the difference from the Authors Guild case: With Google Books, authors stood to lose royalties because users of Google Books were presumably less likely to purchase copies of the books themselves. With ChatGPT, however, if a user invokes the bot to generate a text, and then said user looks to sell that text for a profit, it could be a different ball game. This is the basis of cases in the world of generative art. It’s a brave new legal world.\nBrianne Kane is senior editorial coordinator at Scientific American.\nTamlyn Hunt | Opinion\nTim Hornyak and Nature magazine\nSophie Bushwick, Kelso Harper and Jeffery DelViscio\nAnanya\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "EPA's Critics Recycle Nonsense about Cost to Cut Pollution", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nFor decades industry has claimed that curbing pollution costs too much, but the reality has proven otherwise. Here we go again, this time on power plant carbon emissions\nAs young lawyers, working out of the dusty attic in an aging townhouse, a few of us were given a simple but monumental task: figure out how to make a new law—the Clean Air Act—work.\nThe struggle for clean air we engaged in five decades ago is, sadly, relevant once again as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to create the first carbon standards for power plants.\nIn 1971 the EPA was less than a year old, and Congress had given it just a few months to set limits to pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, that harm our lungs and can cause asthma. The EPA moved quickly, issuing rules that year mandating that new coal-fired power plants either install scrubbers or burn low-sulfur coal.\nScrubbers act like chemical cleaners of smokestack exhaust. While ubiquitous now, only a few were then in operation. Still, the EPA determined the equipment would perform well once the standards were in place. What happened next would not surprise anyone who has followed the Clean Air Act for the past five decades: the electric companies howled.\nIn a full-page New York Times advertisement, American Electric Power claimed that scrubbers have been “time and time again proven too unreliable, too impractical for electric utility use.” It concluded: “If the system doesn’t clog and shut down, it creates massive amounts of sludge.”\nUnder pressure from coal-heavy utilities and their congressional allies, the EPA undertook nationwide listening sessions where the agency’s new bureaucrats were bombarded with criticism: the new rules relied on unproven technology; the compliance deadline was too tight; jobs would be lost; the electricity grid would falter; prices would skyrocket, and the American economy would suffer a monumental toll.\nI watched all this blowback with alarm, wondering if the EPA and Congress would back down. In the end, the utilities and coal companies managed to secure a few short delays and technical tweaks, but the EPA—with support and legal pressure from the Natural Resources Defense Council (where I still work today)—stuck by its crucial pollution control requirements for those new plants.\nWhen the companies’ lawyers failed to block the rules, the companies’ engineers took over. And they delivered.\nSulfur dioxide pollution has fallen by more than 90 percent in the U.S., thanks to EPA rules—one of the great environmental protection achievements in the history of the U.S. The EPA found that without the clean air standards put in place after 1970, 205,000 more Americans would have died prematurely over the subsequent two decades, and millions more would have suffered illnesses ranging from asthma to high blood pressure. The economic benefits in just those two decades are stunning, with estimates ranging from $6 trillion to $50 trillion.\nOver the past five decades, however, the electricity industry has kept crying wolf whenever the EPA proposes new pollution limits.\nWhether it was the acid rain programs in the 1990s or the EPA rules to cut mercury and other toxic air pollutants in 2012, the industry’s playbook remains the same: Sure, we want to protect public health and the environment, they will say, but your rules—now the power plant carbon standards— are too much, too fast, too expensive. We won’t be able to keep delivering reliable electricity.\nAnd, just as with sulfur dioxide, once the rules are in place and the company engineers get to work, deadlines are met, pollution is cut—and the American economy keeps humming along. In fact, in nearly every case the power sector has cut pollution faster and for less money than the EPA forecast.\nAnd so, here we are today.\nIn May, the EPA proposed critical standards to cut carbon pollution from power plants. Long overdue, they come 14 years after EPA determined that carbon dioxide endangers our health and well-being by driving destructive climate change. The standards, which would phase in requirements on coal and gas plants over a decade or more, are an important piece of the puzzle to address the climate crisis.\nGiven market trends toward cheaper wind and solar energy and the billions of dollars of clean energy incentives in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, the electricity sector is changing. Clean energy is on the rise. These rules will ensure those economic and carbon reduction benefits are fully delivered.\nMany utilities have publicly committed to cut their carbon emissions, some laying out plans to get to net zero by 2050, and mostly there by the mid-2030s. But now that the EPA is actually setting rules to make sure they follow that path, the familiar arguments are back: This is too much and too fast. The EPA rules will endanger grid reliability. And the costs—oh my!\nNonsense. Fifty years of experience tell us that when companies stop relying on their lawyers, their engineers and grid experts know how to keep the lights on. And the EPA’s proposed rules allow for exceptions, extensions and waivers if real reliability problems should crop up, so that power companies can keep their plants operating when needed.   \nAnd, in fact, we’ve been here before.\nBack in 2015, the Obama administration adopted the first carbon pollution standards for power plants with rules aimed at delivering a 32-percent reduction in power plant emissions by 2030. Big industry dusted off the old playbook. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued: “It will drive up electricity costs for businesses, consumers and families, [and] impose tens of billions in annual compliance costs.” The North American Electric Reliability Corporation, NERC, a nonprofit that oversees the system, said the “proposed timeline does not provide enough time to develop sufficient resources to ensure continued reliable operation of the electric grid.” And coal industry interests went to court to block the rule. In a rare move, the Supreme Court stepped in to stay the EPA standards.\nThe Clean Power Plan never went into effect.\nBut then something remarkable happened: While the rules were on hold, the U.S. hit the Clean Power Plan targets of a 32-percent reduction in carbon emissions—11 years early! Again, even with no rules in place, the power sector achieved what industry claimed would lead to steep costs and reliability problems.\nCheaper, cleaner options have replaced many old fossil-fuel plants. With the historic support from tax incentives passed by Congress, new technologies are coming online quickly. And the grid continues to deliver cleaner, affordable, reliable electricity. But, given the climate crisis, we need new standards now to cut carbon pollution faster.\nIt’s time for industry to throw away its old playbook and put its engineers to work.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nDavid Hawkins is a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

{"title": "Song of the Stars, Part 3: The Universe in all Senses", "date": "", "text": "An astronomy festival in Italy opted to make all of its events and workshops multisensory. They wanted to see whether sound, touch and smell can, like sight, transmit the wonders of the cosmos.\n[CLIP: Music]\nTimmy Broderick: So I’m sitting inside this stone clock tower in the small town of Castellaro Lagusello in Italy. It’s pretty old, like 800 years old. I had found a nook in this tower where I could sit and record this ethereal music coming from the speaker in front of me. And through the slit of a window behind me, I could watch Italians mill about below.\nJason Drakeford: So Timmy, why are you being a recluse in this tower instead of talking with people on the ground?\nBroderick: [Laughs.] Well, it’s a fair question. I was gathering tape to be played on this podcast, but it was also my last day at the Universe in All Senses, it’s an astronomy festival. And I was pooped. For three days, I ran around this tiny, picturesque town capturing what was likely the first multisensory astronomy festival ever.\n[CLIP: Music]\nBroderick: Oh, does this sound familiar?\nDrakeford: Yes! That’s Matt Russo’s TRAPPIST-1 sonification that we listened to in the first episode!\nBroderick: Yeah! The festival organizers rigged up the clock tower to play a bunch of sonifications on a loop, and then at night, they’d project visualizations of these compositions onto the face of the clock tower.\n[CLIP: Show theme music]\nDrakeford: You are listening to Scientific American’s Science, Quickly. I’m Jason Drakeford.\nBroderick: And I’m Timmy Broderick. In the prior episode of this three-part Fascination, we dove into the origins of turning space data into sound. In this final episode, we’re traveling to Italy to see whether astronomical sonifications can help people with disabilities better understand the awe and wonder of the cosmos.\nBroderick [on tape]: Okay, so I’m walking around. Four thousand people at once is a lot…\nDrakeford: Okay so how did you even hear about this festival?\nBroderick: In January I wrote a story about this burgeoning movement in astronomy. One of my sources for that story was Anita Zanella. She’s an Italian astronomer who grew up playing with her relatives on the stone streets of Castellaro Lagusello. She told me about the festival.\nAnita Zanella: Castellaro has a lot of historical buildings. The villa and the lake are typical ones. The other important point for this little village is the tower, which is really the key part, the heart, of the village.\nBroderick: Castellaro has been holding an astronomy festival for a couple years now. But this is the first time it has really been multisensory. Every workshop, every talk, every event—all of them were available in at least two senses.\nZanella: Inclusion is the main focus this year. So being able to share the knowledge and the beauty of astronomy and the beauty of the universe with whoever, irrespective of disability and sensory limitations.\nBroderick: They also had these giant QR code-like signs set up around the festival to help blind people navigate and understand a workshop or exhibit.\nDrakeford: Uhuh.\nBroderick: It was pretty wild. My phone picked up the code from like 10 feet away!\nDrakeford: Woah, this is so cool!\n[CLIP: Festival sound]\nBroderick: Yeah. The highlight of the first evening was the keynote panel with Anita and two visually impaired astronomers, Nic Bonne and Enrique Pérez-Montero. You might remember Enrique from our last episode. The three of them discussed how to build a “multi-sensory discovery of the sky above us.”\n[CLIP: Festival sound]\nBroderick: After the discussion, I talked with Claudia Beschi. She’s 25, hails from nearby Mantova, wants to be a translator and just completed graduate school. She found the discussion fascinating. She’s also been blind since birth.\n[CLIP: “The Bullet Cluster” by Matt Russo] \nClaudia Beschi: I didn’t think it was possible to translate galaxies into sounds.... I felt like nature was talking to me.\nI believe that nature has its own sounds. And listening to that sound, it was as if that galaxy was telling something to me. Like this galaxy was describing itself to me.\nDrakeford: Woah. The galaxy was speaking to her. This is wild!\nBroderick: Yeah, I was actually really moved by that conversation. It stuck with me throughout the festival.\nAnd so the next day was the first, like, full day. There was a lot going on. We had a bunch of workshops happening. We had a radio wave scavenger hunt, we had comet smelling, there was crafting galaxies out of felt and other fabrics, and also last but definitely not least, banging pots and pans to represent stellar energies.\n[CLIP: Pots and pans banging]\nAll of the workshops were staffed by local kids who could teach the attendees and especially the young kids. Elisa Zaltieri goes to high school in Mantova, and she ran the pots and pans station.\nZaltieri: It's an activity about how stars are actually different. We make child play pots actually.\nBroderick (tape): So what are you gonna have these kids do?\nZaltieri: We have to make them recognize how stars are different and then we have to make them play, like, if they were stars.\nWe were trying to explain to them that [for] the biggest star, play the hardest. And the smallest, play lower, actually, because they have less energy.\nBroderick (tape): So if you play really loudly, you'll have more energy; if you play really softly, you’ll have less energy?\nZaltieri: Yep!\n[CLIP: Pots and pans banging]\nBroderick: While the festival was ostensibly for kids, there were many workshops and events for adults.\nMattia Grella: I’m Mattia, 33, and I’m from Verona, quite close by.\nBroderick: Mattia came to the festival for a couple of reasons. He knows one of the organizers, but he is also passionate about astronomy. He’s a hardcore Trekkie, as well. I met him at one of the workshops. He was creating a kind of patch made from different fabric textures. It was supposed to represent the different parts of a galaxy.\nGrella: It’s smooth and kind of wavy, soft but not really smooth, kind of like the music we listened to before. It was a piece played on the piano. It was a soft piece, but played with the piano, it also had kind of a certain rhythm to it. So these little waves, at least to me, they represent this softness but also this movement.\nBroderick: Mattia has been visually impaired since birth. His version of space is definitely not the inky, black expanse that you or I perceive it as.\nGrella: I know the stars are classified like yellow dwarfs, red giants. And in my head, I imagined them quite with vivid colors, but I have no idea if they’re like basically white with a slight shade of yellow, red, or if they’re as vivid as I imagine them.\n[CLIP: “SgrA Chandra” by Matt Russo] \nDrakeford: So what did you think? Was the festival successful?\nBroderick: To be honest, I’m not sure. It was definitely fun! Like, everyone I saw was having a great time and really engaged with astronomy. But I didn’t really see many people using those giant QR codes. I know that there was bus trouble that kept many local blind and partially sighted people from coming to Castellaro.\nDrakeford: Were there a lot of visually impaired people there?\n[CLIP: “The Galactic Center” by Matt Russo] \nBroderick: I don’t know how many of the 4,000 attendees were blind or visually impaired. Neither do the festival organizers. That’s just unknowable. What I do know is that for the blind people I talked with — for Claudia, for Mattia — the festival and sonifications were really helpful. Claudia was there for one night, but she was thrilled by what she heard.\nBeschi: I don’t know if I will see the world in a different way in the future, but I’m sure that this experience, in a way, taught something positive to me. Because I love nature. I think that nature speaks to us in every way possible. And these translations into sound and into tactile modes is a really good way to get in touch with nature, especially for us because we can’t, we can’t see how nature is really made of.\n[CLIP: Outro music]\nBroderick: Science, Quickly is produced by Jeff DelViscio, Tulika Bose, Kelso Harper and Carin Leong. Our theme music was composed by Dominic Smith.

{"title": "How to See the 'Ring of Fire' Annular Solar Eclipse of October 14", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nThis annular solar eclipse will only reveal its full glory to a select few, but onlookers across much of the Western Hemisphere can catch a partial glimpse of the dazzling phenomenon\nPeople in parts of the U.S., Mexico, and Central and South America are in for a rare celestial treat in October: an annular eclipse of the sun.\nAn annular eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, in which the moon completely covers the sun’s face, except at the former’s peak, the moon is too small in the sky to fully blot out our home star. This creates a bright ring of sunlight around a dark lunar silhouette—thus the name “annular,” which means “ring-shaped.” (Some people prefer to simply call an annular eclipse a “ring of fire” instead.)\nSolar eclipses happen when the moon passes directly in front of the sun—essentially, our natural satellite’s shadow sweeps across the surface of Earth. If the moon orbited in the same plane as Earth orbits the sun, we’d get a solar eclipse every 29 days—the length of time it takes the moon to move around our planet, relative to the sun. But the moon’s orbit is actually tipped, inclined by about five degrees to that of Earth.\nLike two Hula-Hoops, one inside the other and tipped, the path the sun appears to take around the sky once per year and the moon’s monthly orbit intersect at two points, called nodes. We only get a solar eclipse when both the sun and moon are at a node at the same time; otherwise the moon “misses” the sun in the sky, passing it above or below. Most of the time the two don’t line up perfectly, resulting in a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon blocks only a fraction of the sun’s face.\nIf they line up just right, the entirety of the sun’s Earth-facing hemisphere is blocked, and we get the glory of a total solar eclipse. The sky gets dark, and the sun’s ethereal outer atmosphere, called its corona, pops into prominence. I was in Wyoming for the 2017 total solar eclipse, and it was, without exaggeration, one of the most beautiful and moving events I have ever witnessed. The U.S. will be treated to another one of these incredible phenomena on April 8, 2024.\nBut sooner than that—on October 14, to be specific—yet another factor will come into play: the moon’s distance from Earth.\nBy an amazing coincidence, on average, the sun is 400 times farther away from Earth and 400 times physically bigger than the moon. These two effects cancel out, so the sun and moon are the same apparent size in the sky: about half a degree, or half the width of your extended pinky seen at arm’s length.\nThe moon doesn’t orbit Earth in a circle, however, but in an ellipse. At its closest, the point in its orbit called perigee, the moon is roughly 355,000 kilometers from the surface of Earth. At its farthest—apogee—it’s about 397,000 km. That change of about 10 percent in distance means that the moon’s apparent size in the sky changes by 10 percent over the course of half an orbit. So at its apogee, the moon can appear to be smaller than the sun.\nThe moon reaches apogee on October 9, just five days before this upcoming eclipse. It will be about 391,000 km from Earth—more or less. The exact figure depends on other factors, such as the latitude and longitude of the observer, the time of day, and so on. At that distance, it will appear to be 0.51 degree across. At the same time, Earth and the sun will be at almost exactly their average separation, 149 million km, so the sun will appear as a disk about 0.54 degree in size.\nAnd that makes all the difference in the worlds. The moon will be too small to completely cover the sun. Instead it will leave a ring—an annulus—around it as it passes, creating this annular eclipse. At most, 91 percent of the sun’s surface will be covered by the moon, so technically this will be a partial eclipse—but a very special, perfectly centered one.\nThe eclipse will have three main stages: first contact, annularity and last contact. First contact will be when the moon’s edge first appear to touch the edge of the sun. Over time, as the moon moves, it will appear to eat more and more of our star’s disk. About 70 to 90 minutes after first contact, depending on your location, the annularity will occur. It will last from one to five minutes, also depending on location. Then the moon will start to leave the sun’s face. Our natural satellite will take another 70 to 90 minutes to completely move off the star (last contact).\nThat’s how the eclipse will work. So how can you see it?\nFirst, there is no safe time to watch this with your naked eye! Throughout the eclipse’s duration, the sun will be visible, so you will need adequate eye protection. (Do not just use sunglasses, exposed film or welder’s glasses.) A lot of companies sell “eclipse glasses”—usually a paper frame with heavily filtered plastic film to look through—but not all of these are safe. The American Astronomical Society has a list of trusted vendors that have glasses that are compliant with the ISO 12312-2, the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO’s) safety standard for directly viewing the sun. I’ll add that Astronomy for Equity sells them in bulk, and the money they organization makes from those sales goes toward excellent causes.\nA fun way to observe this event is with a pinhole projector. A small hole poked into a piece of cardboard will allow sunlight through as parallel rays—that is, as focused light suitable for imaging. You can then hold it up and project the resulting rays onto a sheet of white paper, a sidewalk or even the bare ground. You’ll see a lovely perfect little image of the sun as the moon eats away at it. Foliage can produce a similar effect as well (overlapping leaves make lots of little holes), so you can see dozens or even hundreds of images of the sun on the ground below most trees.\nOn the morning of October 14, the path of the moon’s shadow will start over the Pacific Ocean. The exact time it will reach any given spot will depend on the location and the time zone. For example, Eugene, Ore., the first big city to see annularity, will get the first contact at 8:06 A.M. PDT, the annularity for four minutes starting at 9:16 A.M. and then the last contact at 10:39 A.M. The moon’s shadow will move southeast, passing over extremely northeastern California, Nevada, Utah, extremely northeastern Arizona, New Mexico and then Texas. After that it will pass over the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico, followed by southern Central America and then northern South America before moving off onto the Atlantic Ocean.\nAstronomer and long-time umbraphile (literally, “shadow lover”) Fred Espenak has created an interactive map for the eclipse path. Just zoom in and click anywhere to get detailed information on timing.\nI’ll add that the entire continental U.S. will see at least a partial eclipse, but only those along the narrow shadow path will be able to view the ring of fire. NASA has an excellent website with loads of information about the eclipse. SciStarter, a terrific program that promotes “citizen science” projects, has a list of scientific projects you can participate in as well—excellent prep for next year’s total solar eclipse. The American Astronomical Society also has an app (available for iOS and Android devices) called Totality 3.0, which has a ton of information about this eclipse and next year’s total one, too.\nI’ve never seen an annular eclipse, and from my location in Virginia, only be about one third of the sun will be covered. But if you’re in the path of annularity, and you’re able to do so, go out and take a look (safely, please)! Although it’s perhaps not as grand as a total solar eclipse, it’s still a fascinating and rare astronomical phenomenon and one well worth your time to observe.\nPhil Plait is a professional astronomer and science communicator in Colorado.

{"title": "Supermassive Black Hole Feeding Frenzies May Explain Blinking Quasars", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nA new simulation shows black holes ripping apart and consuming their accretion disk in a matter of months, which may explain why some quasars quickly brighten and dim\nSupermassive black holes may tear apart and devour their disk of surrounding dust and gas at a shocking speed, perhaps explaining the behavior of a mysterious class of rapidly brightening quasar.\nWeighing a million to a billion times the mass of the sun, supermassive black holes are thought to sit at the centers of galaxies, where they consume a flattened disk of debris that surrounds their event horizon, that point of no return where matter cannot escape gravity’s clutches. New research suggests that black hole heavyweights may consume the inner parts of their accretion disk within months to years, much faster than the previously believed time frame of centuries to millennia. Though the results come from a computer simulation, not the real thing, this timescale would match observations of so-called changing-look quasars. Quasars are galactic cores where dust and gas fall into a black hole and release brilliant flares of electromagnetic radiation. Changing-look quasars dim and brighten on the order of months, which is a perplexing time line, given the massive scales involved.\n“Something weird is happening that’s turning the light off, and then somehow it rebrightens in a very, very short amount of time for a supermassive black hole,” says study leader Nick Kaaz, a graduate student in astrophysics at Northwestern University. Solving the puzzle could help explain how the black hole behemoths at the centers of galaxies, including the Milky Way, formed and grew.\nEarly models of black holes couldn’t really explain changing-look quasars. These early models were limited, Kaaz says, because they assumed that a black hole and its accretion disk would be in alignment: both would exist along the same plane and rotate in the same direction. “Now we have the power of these really powerful computer simulations, so we can probe more complicated questions,” he says.\nThe research team used Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Summit, one of the world’s largest supercomputers, to create a three-dimensional model of a black hole with a tilted accretion disk. Instead of rotating smoothly like a vinyl record on a turntable, this off-kilter accretion disk acts more like a gyroscope, with disks spinning and wobbling at different angles and speeds. The forces driving the rotation are strongest nearer to the black hole and weakest farther away, Kaaz says, so there’s a natural tendency for the disk to rip apart. But forces such as friction and magnetic fields work to keep it together.\n“You have this competition between the rotation of the black hole trying to tear the thing up and the internal hydrodynamics of the accretion disks trying to stay together,” he says.\nThis galactic-level game of tug-of-war causes spacetime itself to warp. Because this warping strengthens closer to the event horizon, the accretion disk begins to pull apart, and the inner disk separates from the outer disk, Kaaz and his colleagues reported on September 20 in the Astrophysical Journal. These two disks violently crash into each other, Kaaz says, and the force of the outer disk pushes material from the inner disk into the black hole. The void left behind quickly refills with outer disk materials that then go through the same violent cycle before being gobbled up as well.\nThis process could be what’s behind changing-look quasars, Kaaz says. “We have something new that must look interesting observationally,” he says. “And then there’s something observationally that’s a mystery that could be a natural match for this story.”\nThe research reveals interesting details about the structures within the chaotic double disks, says Vicente Valenzuela-Villaseca, a postdoctoral researcher and plasma physicist at Princeton University, who wasn’t involved in the new study. For his own research, Valenzuela-Villaseca creates black hole accretion disks out of plasma, or charged gas, in the laboratory. His team could disturb the simulated accretion disk to try to re-create the kind of dynamics Kaaz and his colleagues found, Valenzuela-Villaseca says.\n“There’s a very well-known correlation between the mass of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy and the galaxy,” Valenzuela-Villaseca adds. “It seems like they co-evolve.” Astronomers are still puzzling out how supermassive black holes grew as quickly as they did in the early universe, so a better understanding of their dynamics could help answer questions about their origins, Kaaz says.\nSuch wobbly accretion disks might also surround the much smaller stellar black holes, which are typically around three to 20 times the mass of the sun. These itty-bitty black holes may also have tilted disks and similarly chaotic dynamics, Kaaz says. “This field is in this ongoing campaign to try to understand what we see in the night sky and catalog it all,” he says.\nStephanie Pappas is a freelance science journalist.

{"title": "What's a Qubit? 3 Ways Scientists Build Quantum Computers", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nScientists are trying to master the basic computing element known as a qubit to make quantum computers more powerful than electronic machines\nIf you buy into the hype, quantum computers promise to revolutionize the world. Scientists hope future versions of this nascent technology could allow pharmaceutical companies to discover new drugs in weeks instead of years or enable governments to calculate the logistics of how to feed the world’s growing population. Tech giants, start-up companies and university laboratories are vying to create bigger and better quantum computers. But so far none have conclusively achieved “quantum advantage”—the point where a quantum computer can solve a problem no classical computer can. The key quantum computing element is the qubit, and different groups are betting on different qubits to make quantum computers roar.\nA complete quantum computing system could be as large as a two-car garage when one factors in all the paraphernalia required for smooth operation. But the entire processing unit, made of qubits, would barely cover the tip of your finger.\nToday’s smartphones, laptops and supercomputers contain billions of tiny electronic processing elements called transistors that are either switched on or off, signifying a 1 or 0, the binary language computers use to express and calculate all information. Qubits are essentially quantum transistors. They can exist in two well-defined states—say, up and down—which represent the 1 and 0. But they can also occupy both of those states at the same time, which adds to their computing prowess. And two—or more—qubits can be entangled, a strange quantum phenomenon where particles’ states correlate even if the particles lie across the universe from each other. This ability completely changes how computations can be carried out, and it is part of what makes quantum computers so powerful, says Nathalie de Leon, a quantum physicist at Princeton University. Furthermore, simply observing a qubit can change its behavior, a feature that de Leon says might create even more of a quantum benefit. “Qubits are pretty strange. But we can exploit that strangeness to develop new kinds of algorithms that do things classical computers can’t do,” she says.\nScientists are trying a variety of materials to make qubits. They range from nanosized crystals to defects in diamond to particles that are their own antiparticles. Each comes with pros and cons. “It's too early to call which one is the best,” says Marina Radulaski of the University of California, Davis. De Leon agrees. Let’s take a look.\nThe qubit that most frequently grabs headlines is the “superconducting” qubit, preferred by Google and IBM, two of the largest companies that are developing quantum computers. Google’s largest functioning computer has 53 superconducting qubits, and IBM’s has 433, though right now more isn’t necessarily better. Google’s qubits are made of aluminum; IBM uses a mix of aluminum and niobium, the two most often used materials for this qubit type.\nA superconducting qubit is typically a tiny loop or line of metal that behaves like an atom—an inherently quantum object. The two states of the qubit correspond to two energy states of this artificial atom: its lowest energy state, which is known as the ground state, and the next one up. The states are initiated and controlled using microwave pulses.\nThe superconducting qubit became an early quantum-computing front-runner in part because it can be manufactured and operated with existing technologies used to make and operate electronic transistors. The qubit processor is about as wide as the thickness of a fingernail. Small is key because estimates indicate that a world-changing quantum computer will need one million to 10 million qubits, says quantum computing engineer Jeff Thompson, also at Princeton.\nAlthough superconducting qubits are small and inexpensive, the hardware needed to operate them is neither. To behave like an atom, a superconducting qubit must be cooled to a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero, which is –273 degrees Celsius. Doing that requires a dilution refrigerator, a machine bigger than a residential fridge and significantly more costly to buy and operate. Also, at least two wires and other hardware are needed for every qubit. “The cost per qubit ends up pretty high,” Thompson says.\nRight now scientists can only support tens to hundreds of superconducting qubits in a dilution refrigerator, but they have plans for getting to the thousands. For millions of connected qubits, engineers will, among other things, either need to build bigger refrigerators, a challenge they are working on, or quantumly connect—that is, entangle the signals—of superconducting qubit arrays housed in different refrigerators, a currently unachievable feat. Finding a way to get the quantum information out of one cold qubit and into another, is “the holy grail” of this technology, says Britton Plourde, a superconducting qubit expert at Syracuse University. “It’s a very hard problem.”\nA popular alternative to the superconducting qubit is the trapped-ion qubit: a charged atom or molecule that behaves like a tiny bar magnet. The two states of the ion correspond to two orientations of this magnet, say up and down, and they can be set by hitting the ion with a laser beam thinner than a human hair. Companies that are exploring this technology have popped up in the past few years, including Alpine Quantum Technologies (which has a computer with 24 qubits), IonQ (which has 29 qubits) and Quantinuum (which has 32 qubits). AQT uses calcium ions; the other two use ytterbium ions.\nEach company’s trapped-ion computer looks slightly different, but they all contain the same elements: a computing chip the size of a dime or bigger, a cylindrical vacuum chamber the size of a large beer can around that chip, a handful of lasers and a light detector. The chip houses the ions and traps them using electric fields in the voids between its tiny printed circuits. The lasers shoot through the windows of the vacuum chamber, cooling the ions and operating the qubits.\nThe vacuity of the space around an ion qubit means that its state (0, 1 or both) is relatively unimpacted by state-destroying air particles. As a result, it can retain its quantum information for minutes to hours—compared with a few hundred microseconds for a superconducting qubit. That long life is great for quantum data storage, but it can be problematic for performing complex calculations. That’s because the property that gives the qubit good data storage abilities—low interaction with the environment—makes it hard to control interactions among the qubits. So computations on this system take much longer.\nTrapped-ion qubit computers also have a scalability problem. Each chip can contain at most a few tens of ions without the interactions among them becoming too complex to control. Reaching millions of qubits will require moving ions between modules, a feat scientists have yet to reliably achieve. Chips in multiple vacuum chambers will also need to be connected to reach the million-qubit mark.\nScalability is less of a problem for the so-called neutral-atom qubit. A neutral-atom quantum computer is like a charged-atom one, but light rather than electricity holds the atoms in place. To make the light traps, scientists shine a laser through a lens above a chamber containing neutral atoms. The lens splits the incoming beam into a multitude of light spots, each of which can hold an atom in place. The same splitting occurs for other laser beams, which are used to operate the qubits.\nScientists have created arrays of two to 1,000 neutral-atom qubits, and QuEra has a quantum computer with 256 neutral rubidium atoms, a common atom choice. Next-generation lenses and lasers will likely take that number to 10,000 or more, Thompson says. “Adding qubits just requires splitting the laser into more beams, which simplifies scaling,” he says. Neutral-atom qubits also have a reasonably long lifetime, retaining their information for tens of seconds.\nOne reason the neutral-atom qubit isn’t the front-runner in the quantum computer race is speed. Thus far they can perform a few calculations per second—comparable to trapped-ion quantum computers but more than 1,000 times slower than a superconducting-qubit system. And although it’s easy to make neutral-atom qubits, they are finicky to operate. Performing a complex calculation requires hitting the atom with a carefully timed sequence of laser pulses; researchers have yet to work out how to efficiently and rapidly operate more than a handful of neutral-atom qubits. Once they do—and Thompson is confident they will—neutral atoms could surpass superconducting qubits in computing power, grabbing the headlines. “I think that transition point will be pretty soon, barring any unforeseen events,” Thompson says.\nEven with such a breakthrough, a system that reliably performs calculations that a classical computer can’t is still a ways off, says Luca Dellantonio, a quantum physicist at the University of Exeter in England, who develops algorithms to run on quantum hardware. It turns out that operating the qubits is the “easy” part of the challenge. The “difficult” part is correcting errors that pop up as quantum calculations progress, which happens at a significantly higher rate than in classical systems. An error occurs when the state of a qubit is altered by some influence outside of those used to run the computer. “It can be anything really,” Dellantonio says. The factor could be heat, radiation from space or a sneeze made by someone sneezing on the other side of the world. “The problem of building a quantum computer is much harder than scientists tend to admit,” he adds. “It will happen, just not as quickly as people thought.”\nKatherine Wright is a science writer and deputy editor at Physics Magazine.\nIlyas Khan | Opinion\nJohn Horgan | Opinion\nDavide Castelvecchi and Nature\nDavide Castelvecchi\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Congressional Budget Turmoil Stops FEMA from Doling out $8 Billion", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nPuerto Rico will be hit hardest by spending restrictions set by FEMA as disaster funding runs short. More than $2 billion is expected to be withheld from the island, which is still reeling from past hurricanes\nCLIMATEWIRE | The federal government is planning to withhold $8 billion in disaster funds from states due to temporary new spending restrictions outlined in a previously unreported document that shows how the budget turmoil in Congress could affect the nation.\nThe restrictions, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency imposed on itself, threaten to delay thousands of FEMA-funded projects in 27 states and territories aimed at repairing roads, buildings and other facilities damaged by disasters in recent years, the FEMA document shows.\nPuerto Rico is projected to be hit the hardest, as it struggles to rebuild from Hurricane Maria in 2017, earthquakes in 2020 and Hurricane Fiona in 2022.\nThe financially strained U.S. territory could have up to $2.6 billion withheld for projects such as rebuilding critical facilities like hospitals and the electrical grid, the FEMA document shows.\n“This is an enormous impact not just on the pace of rebuilding but on the economy,” Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón (R) told E&E News in a statement. “This has an immediate effect on municipalities, contractors and suppliers.”\nThe $8 billion represents the amount of money that FEMA would ordinarily give states for rebuilding projects but expects to withhold under spending restrictions it imposed Aug. 29 to preserve its dwindling Disaster Relief Fund.\nUnder the restrictions, known as “immediate needs funding,” FEMA has stopped giving states money for non-urgent projects related to damage from disasters that happened more than a year ago. FEMA generally pays 75 percent of the cost of the projects.\nIn turn, FEMA is funding only \"urgent recovery efforts\" such as clearing roads and sheltering displaced residents immediately after a disaster. The restrictions have not affected FEMA’s ongoing aid to Hawaii after recent wildfires and to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina after Hurricane Idalia.\nA senior FEMA official told E&E News that the agency could end up withholding more money if Congress is delayed in approving new disaster funding.\n“The number could grow the longer INF is put in place,” the official said, using the acronym for immediate needs funding.\nFEMA’s funding restrictions will remain in place until Congress replenishes the disaster fund by approving either a fiscal 2024 budget or special funding for FEMA.\nNeither action appears imminent. As House Republicans remain divided on federal spending, a government shutdown appears increasingly likely to start at midnight on Saturday when fiscal 2023 ends.\nThe potential withholding of $8 billion marks the first time FEMA has fully accounted for the effect of its spending restrictions — and shows that its financial impact could be much larger than perviously thought.\nAdministrator Deanne Criswell told a House hearing Sept. 19 that the agency had withheld $1.5 billion from states since the restrictions began. Criswell did not mention the $8 billion projection and urged Congress to approve new disaster funding “without delay.”\nThe senior FEMA official updated Criswell’s figures in an interview and said the agency has withheld $2.8 billion since Aug. 29 for more than 2,000 rebuilding projects.\nFEMA’s withholding does not automatically prevent states, territories and localities from starting reconstruction projects. Some jurisdictions could begin the projects using their own money and wait for FEMA reimbursement.\nBut smaller jurisdictions with limited funds are “not going to be able to continue” with rebuilding projects, Criswell told a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on Sept. 19.\nFEMA has imposed \"immediate needs funding\" restrictions eight times since 2003, most recently in 2017 when hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria quickly drained the disaster fund.\nFEMA disclosed the $8 billion projection in the fine print of a report it published Sept. 11 on the disaster fund. A footnote to an appendix notes that there will be “an estimated $8 billion in projects delayed due to Immediate Needs Fund.”\nA separate appendix explains in tiny typeface the amount of money that FEMA expects to withhold in connection with 27 disasters for which permanent reconstruction work is underway.\nThe 27 disasters include the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in every state receiving disaster funds. FEMA estimates that $4.5 billion of the $8 billion it expects to withhold will be distributed among the 59 states, territories and tribes that are receiving disaster aid for their pandemic response.\nSome of the disasters for which FEMA expects to withhold funds occurred 18 years ago, including hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.\nThe withholding would have a substantial effect on Puerto Rico and its 3.2 million residents, nearly half of whom live in poverty.\nThe island has faced long delays in rebuilding from Maria, due partly to its dilapidated infrastructure before the hurricane.\nThe territory has received $33 billion from FEMA — more than any state or territory has gotten after a single disaster. But billions of dollars of work remain to be done.\nGonzález-Colón, the resident commissioner, said 4,100 rebuilding projects worth $1.9 billion are in various stages of planning or construction and need FEMA funding.\n“Any of those projects that has not already had the funds fully disbursed and in the hands of the local funding recipient would see payments held back,” González-Colón said. That could have a \"chain reaction effect of delaying the time for approval, start, or completion.”\nFlorida and Louisiana also face significant impacts from the FEMA restrictions.\nThe agency indicated it expects to withhold $376 million for projects related to Hurricane Laura, which hit Louisiana in 2020, and Hurricane Ida, which damaged several states including Louisiana in 2021.\nFEMA also expects to withhold $265 million for projects related to Hurricane Ian, which caused massive damage across Florida in 2022.\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has urged lawmakers to approve President Joe Biden's request for $16 billion in emergency cash for FEMA’s disaster fund. But the supplemental funding request remains blocked by lawmakers who oppose Biden’s simultaneous request for $24 billion in aid to Ukraine.\nFEMA is seeking an additional $20 billion for its disaster fund in the fiscal year that begins Sunday.\n“FEMA said it needs $36 billion and anything less than that is simply inadequate,” Scott said in a statement.\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "Reconstruction Helped Her Become a Physician. Jim Crow Drove Her to Flee the U.S.", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSarah Loguen Fraser was the daughter of abolitionists and one of the first African American female doctors trained after the Civil War.\nBorn as Sarah Loguen in 1850, Sarah Loguen Fraser found her calling as a child when she helped her parents and Harriet Tubman bandage the leg of an injured person escaping slavery. When the Civil War ended, and Reconstruction opened up opportunities for African Americans, Loguen Fraser became one of the first Black women to earn a medical license. But quickly, racist Jim Crow laws prevailed. At the urging of family friend Frederick Douglass, she married and, with her new husband Charles Fraser, set sail for the Dominican Republic, where more was possible for a person of color. This is her story.\nLISTEN TO THE PODCAST\n\n[New to this season of Lost Women of Science? Listen to the most recent episodes on Lillian Gilbreth and Lise Meitner: Episode One and Episode Two.]\nLost Women of Science is produced for the ear. Where possible, we recommend listening to the audio for the most accurate representation of what was said.\nEPISODE TRANSCRIPT\nApril Mayes: This is the 1880s. In the United States, the opportunities are closing down for African Americans and they would be opening up for people in the Dominican Republic.\nKatie Hafner: That's historian April Mayes, who's been studying the life of Dr. Sarah Loguen Fraser, one of the first Black female doctors in the United States. \nI'm Katie Hafner, and this is Lost Women of Science. \nSarah Loguen was born in Syracuse, New York in 1850. Generations of her family had long endured shifting political winds, whipsawed from slavery to freedom.\nIn the years following the Civil War, Sarah built a thriving medical practice in Washington, D. C. But the promise of reconstruction was being upended by Jim Crow laws, and she decamped for the Dominican Republic. So her story has a twist. Unlike the usual tales of immigrants seeking a better life in America, her story is about emigration, seeking a better life elsewhere.\nIn 2014, the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D. C. acquired a tintype portrait. The woman in the sepia toned photo from the 1890s appears dark complected. She's wearing a two layer waist length capelet, a full length skirt, and dark gloves.\nThere's a short top hat perched on her head, and beneath it, her face is expressionless, her light eyes fixed squarely on the camera, and she's holding a medical bag. The tintype is marked by the museum as “unidentified”, but bearing, quote, “a strong resemblance to Dr. Sarah Loguen Fraser.” Producer Nora Mathison, brings us her story.\nNora Mathison: If one moment determined Sarah Loguen Fraser's life trajectory, it might have been this one. She was a young girl when abolitionist Harriet Tubman guided a group that was running from slave catchers to a station of the Underground Railroad in Syracuse, New York. \nThe man, two women, and six children all had gunshot wounds to their legs.\nThe house that took them in belonged to Sarah's parents, the Loguens. Little Sarah, who at the time went by the nickname Tinnie, did what she could. \nApril Mayes: Tinnie helped her mother bathe one of the little girls' wounded legs. And for days she felt that she was the most important person in the whole house. \nNora Mathison: That's Pomona College historian April Mayes, reading from a biography of Sarah Loguen Fraser's life. It says that this was a seminal moment.\nApril Mayes: “The seed was sown. It would lie fallow for years, then germinate and grow until it finally flowered”, end quote. \nNora Mathison: The biography is titled “Miss Doc”, the nickname Sarah's patients would later call her. It was written by Sarah's daughter, Gregoria Fraser Goins in the 1930s, but was never finished or published.\nBut, Howard University in Washington, D.C. has the drafts, and April has been studying them, starting with Sarah's birth. \nApril Mayes: She's born in 1850 and I think this is the decade that's so formative in her life. She was born in January of that year and in September the United States Congress passes the Fugitive Slave Act. \nNora Mathison: The 1850 Fugitive Slave Act allowed federal marshals to track down and capture people who had escaped to quote unquote “free” northern states from slave holding southern states and return them to bondage.\nIt stripped these so-called fugitive slaves of any legal rights, and anyone who tried to help them could be charged with a federal crime. The act posed a direct threat to Sarah and her family.\nApril Mayes:  She's the daughter of runaway slave Reverend Jermain Loguen, who was an abolitionist who operated a station of the underground railroad under his house in Syracuse, New York.\nNora Mathison: Syracuse, in upstate New York, was a hotbed of the abolitionist movement, and Jermain Loguen, by then a minister in the AME Zion Church, was known as the King of the Underground Railroad. It's said that the Loguens helped about 1,500 people running from slave catchers, all while Sarah's father risked being sent back into slavery himself. And he was a widely known abolitionist speaker, so he was not hard to track down.\nOne day in 1860, when Sarah was 10 years old, a letter addressed to her father arrived at the family home in Syracuse. It was from Tennessee. Jermaine Loguen had escaped slavery in Tennessee 26 years earlier. It was from the wife of his former enslaver. After all those years, she was demanding payment for her husband's horse, which Jermain had taken when he'd made his escape decades earlier.\nIf Jermain didn't send the payment, she was threatening to have him recaptured and sold. \nHe responds to her, his letter peppered with the phrase, “Wretched Woman”, and he warns her against sending slave catchers. He writes, “I stand among a free people who, I thank God, sympathize with my rights. And if your emissaries and vendors come here to re-enslave me, I trust my strong and brave friends in the city will be my rescuers and avengers.”\nAmong those strong and brave friends in and around Syracuse were Harriet Tubman and famed orator Frederick Douglass, who was a close family friend. \nAnd then there was Jermain's wife, Sarah's mother, Caroline Storum. Caroline was the child of biracial parents. \nThe Storums had lived in the area for several generations, and were well connected and well resourced. Sarah's grandparents were noted abolitionists themselves, so Sarah was born with certain advantages. \nApril Mayes: A mixed race family, free family, a land owning family, a home owning family, with deep, deep roots and ties in northern New York. \nNora Mathison: Sarah's parents, Jermain and Caroline, worked side-by-side at their station on the Underground Railroad, protecting escaped slaves, and Sarah witnessed it all.\nApril Mayes: That's like the first decade of her life\nNora Mathison: In 1861, the Civil War broke out.\nApril Mayes: There's this tremendous shift in the politics around enslavement in the United States. \nNora Mathison: With the war raging, the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, but it would take until the end of the war, two years later, and the ratification of the 13th Amendment for slavery to be declared unconstitutional.\nSarah was 15 when the war ended. \nApril Mayes: And so she's living at the most, probably pivotal moments of U.S. history in the 19th century. \nNora Mathison: Both Sarah's parents lived to see the end of slavery, but they died soon after. \nAt age 22, Sarah was left in Syracuse to find her own way. In these post war years, the early stages of Reconstruction were marked by rapid change and a concerted effort to expand the rights of Black Americans.\nIt was at this moment that Sarah found her calling. \nBy then, her older sister Amelia had married and moved to Washington, D.C. \nIn the spring of 1873, after visiting her, Sarah was waiting to board a train home to Syracuse. \nApril Mayes: And while she's at the station, she notices a little boy. Who is running back and forth between the wagons and hanging feed bags around the necks of the horses. And she notices the kid running around doing his little job, getting the pennies that he's earning, when all of a sudden she hears this scream, and she sees this same little child being dragged from under a heavily loaded wagon. And so she runs to the child and she's trying to get help. And she's screaming. Is there anyone who can help him? Basically, is there a doctor in the house? And there was no help. No one came.  \nNora Mathison: Eventually, the station manager came and found someone to take the boy. \nBut it seemed to take a really, really long time. And Sarah later said it was excruciating to stand by, unable to do anything. \nApril Mayes: And according to Gregoria, it was this moment when her mother decided, and I'm quoting from the text again, \"I will never, never see a human being in need of aid and not be able to help.\" \nNora Mathison: Just months later Sarah applied and was accepted to the newly established Syracuse University College of Medicine. If getting into med school sounds unusually straightforward for Sarah, that may have had something to do with the time and place. The campus was not far from Seneca Falls where, a quarter century earlier, the first women's rights convention was held. And one of the demands coming out of that convention: More women in the field of medicine. \nSarah enrolled at age 23 in October of 1873, and the next day there was an item in her local newspaper.\nApril Mayes: They applaud this as saying, quote, \"This is 'women's rights' in the right direction.\" \nNora Mathison: Syracuse University had been founded just three years earlier, in 1870, by forward thinking Methodists. The medical school was added a year later.\nElise DeAndrea: So they really came in with this open-minded approach to allowing not just men, but women and people of color right from the very beginning.\nNora Mathison: That's Elise DeAndrea. She's the archivist at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Its medical school used to be part of Syracuse University. \nShe says that in Sarah's class of 17 students, Sarah was the only Black person, male or female, but she was not the only woman. \nElise DeAndrea: In the first six years of the College of Medicine, 11 of the 63 total graduates were women, so around 17%.  \nNora Mathison: Nationwide, the number of women earning medical degrees was growing, and that included Black women. \nMeg Vigil-Fowler: One of the most striking things is just how many there were. \nNora Mathison: Meg Vigil Fowler is a medical historian with a focus on Black women in medicine. \nMeg Vigil-Fowler: I was very surprised to find, around 180.\nNora Mathison: A decade earlier, no Black women were licensed medical doctors. Sarah was a member of this new and growing cohort, and she did encounter racism. One story involved making rounds at the hospital. A patient in one of the beds, a black woman, shot a question at Sarah about her race.\nHere's April reading from the biography. \nApril Mayes: ”You're an N-word ain't you?” Tinnie flushed then paled. “I am a colored woman and a doctor.” And the patient responded. \"I don't want no colored woman doctoring me.\"\nNora Mathison: This is actually one of the very few instances of racism mentioned in the biography written by Sarah's daughter. \nApril Mayes: Overall Gregoria paints a picture of med school as a pretty positive, affirming place for her mother. So with respect to that, considering the context that we're in, this reconstruction moment, I ask myself if Gregoria the biographer is also making an argument that this was a time, if not of less racism, at least of a certain optimism that then opened up opportunities for people like her mother, or maybe Doc Sarah never told her daughter, never shared those stories with her, or they didn't happen.\nNora Mathison: Sarah Loguen earned her M.D. in the spring of 1876, the first black woman to get an M.D. from a co-educational institution. She was now Dr. Sarah Loguen. She then took on not one, but two internships. In one of them, Sarah found herself working alongside another female doctor, who was also an intern, a white woman. \nMeg Vigil-Fowler: And, people kept commenting on how much they looked alike\nNora Mathison: The white woman's name was Dr. Logue.  \nMeg Vigil-Fowler: They eventually put it together that Dr. Logue's family had been enslavers of Sarah's dad and grandmother.\nNora Mathison: And the reason the two women looked so similar was that they were probably related. \nSarah's father, Jermain Loguen, had changed his name when he escaped slavery, adding the N to Logue. L-O-G-U-E. His enslaver, David Logue, was almost certainly his father. \nSoon after that, Dr. Logue, the white doctor, left the internship. \nSarah, on the other hand, stayed on. \nAfter completing her clinical training, she moved to Washington D.C. in 1879 and opened a private practice. \nShe was among friends. Frederick Douglass now lived nearby, and he took on the role of surrogate parent to Sarah. When Sarah set up her new office, it was Douglass himself who nailed up the shingle. \nAnd Douglass was no longer just a friend of the family. By now, he literally was family. \nSarah's sister, living in D. C., had married his son, Lewis Douglass. \nSarah was now seeing patients, with close friends and family nearby. \nReconstruction after the Civil War had removed certain obstacles for black Americans, like Sarah, to rise to positions of power and influence.\nThere had been a surge in Black elected officials and greater representation in civic life. Frederick Douglass' youngest son, Charles Douglass, had been living in the Dominican Republic as Vice Consul of the United States, and it was Charles who was about to make an introduction that would again change the course of Sarah's life.\nWe’ll be right back.\n[Ad Break]\nDominique Janee: You're listening to Lost Women of Science.

That’s lostwomenofscience-dot-org. \n[Ad Break Ends]\nApril Mayes: How does she end up in the Dominican Republic? This is a fascinating story.\nNora Mathison: That's Pomona College history professor, April Mayes, who's an expert on the Dominican Republic. \nApril Mayes: You have to have really good friends who are just kind of nosy and in your business. That's how she ends up there.\nNora Mathison: Those really good friends were, of course, the family of Frederick Douglass, particularly his youngest son, Charles, who had been serving as Vice Consul of the U.S., living in the Dominican Republic. \nApril Mayes: And he's meeting people, he's meeting a lot of people. And one of the people that he meets and becomes really good friends with is Charles Fraser. \nCharles Fraser is a chemist. This is what they call pharmacists, in the 19th century, who's an immigrant from St. Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands. Charles Fraser is biracial himself.\nNora Mathison: So the two Charles's, Fraser and Douglass, were good friends. \nApril Mayes: And Charles Douglass basically is like the best wingman ever.\nNora Mathison: In 1876, Charles Fraser, who lived in Puerto Plata, was planning a trip to the U.S. to stock up on pharmaceutical supplies.\nApril Mayes: Charles Douglass tells Charles Fraser, his buddy, Hey, quote, \"Be sure to meet Dr. Sarah Loguen. She's one of the pioneers of her race. We call her Tinnie.\"  \nNora Mathison: Charles arrived in America and tried to go see her, but Sarah was busy with work and never showed up. So Charles returned to Puerto Plata, we imagine, disappointed. He'd only traveled 1,400 miles on a ship to meet this woman. But lucky for him, back in the U.S., the Douglasses kept telling Sarah what a great guy this Charles Fraser is.\nApril Mayes: So she writes this note of regret to him.\nNora Mathison: And they start writing letters back and forth between Washington, D. C. and Puerto Plata. And this goes on and on and on for years. Then, in 1881: \nApril Mayes: She receives a letter from Charles Fraser proposing marriage, and she kind of freaks out.\nNora Mathison: Which makes sense. First of all, they barely know each other. Second, she's trying to build this thriving medical practice in D.C. And Charles?  He lives in the Caribbean.\nApril Mayes: She doesn't respond to Charles until he is already on his way back later in the early fall. \nNora Mathison: And she doesn't exactly say ‘yes’ to his proposal. Not right away. She needs a little convincing, and according to her daughter Gregoria, who better to deliver a convincing argument than the famously persuasive orator himself? \nApril Mayes: Frederick Douglass tells her, “The Dominican Republic is where you can do your best work.”\nNora Mathison: What could stand in the way of Sarah doing her best work? By this time, the early 1880s, Reconstruction in the U.S. is on the wane, and Jim Crow is on the rise. The earth is rapidly shifting under the feet of Black Americans.\nFrederick Douglass believed Sarah's prospects were better in the Dominican Republic. \nSarah finally did make the call, but not until a week before she married Charles Fraser in Syracuse on September 19th, 1882.\nAt around the time the newlyweds were setting sail for a new life together in the Dominican Republic, Frederick Douglass wrote again to Sarah. ​\nApril Mayes: He is supposed to have told her quote, \"The life there is very different from what it is here. There you feel the full stature of manhood.\" \nNora Mathison: What does that mean? \nApril Mayes: The Dominican Republic in the last quarter of the 19th century is undergoing tremendous change.\nNora Mathison:  The country had just been through a war. It had won its independence from Haiti in 1844, but in the early 1860s, Spain occupied the country. Dominican nationalists fought back and won their sovereignty. \nApril Mayes: And in that post-war moment, there is this period of national consolidation, right. There's railroad building. There's investment in technology. Telegraph lines come in. \nNora Mathison: Like the U.S. during its brief reconstruction era after the Civil War, the Dominican Republic in the 1870s and 80s was also trying to repair and reinvent itself.\nUnlike the United States, though, the Dominican Republic had abolished slavery back in 1822. That's more than 40 years before the U.S. did. \nPlus, after winning its own independence, there was a lot of unrest on the islands all around the Dominican Republic, which meant that the Frasers found themselves among political exiles coming from those neighboring countries when they arrived in Puerto Plata in October of 1882. \nApril Mayes: It's a place where on the streets, you could hear Spanish, but also English, French, Haitian Creole. Danish spoken, and no one would blink an eye. And so in a sense, the Frasers were one among a number of people who were new, who were establishing themselves in Puerto Plata, and they become part of a group of these aspiring immigrants.\nNora Mathison: Charles went back to work at his pharmacy on a busy street in town. But for Sarah, who had left her medical practice behind, there was one big problem. \nApril Mayes: When she moves to Puerto Plata she's not yet speaking Spanish. So the first thing is she's got to learn to speak Spanish. \nNora Mathison: Luckily, Sarah had a connection to a man, a man of the cloth. \nApril Mayes: Padre Fernando Arturo Merino, who is a forward thinking progressive Catholic Bishop… \nNora Mathison: …who offered to help her with Spanish lessons. Padre Merino had just wrapped up two years as President of the Dominican Republic when Sarah arrived.\nApril Mayes: And it's him, Padre Merino, who encourages her to practice telling her, “Hey, you are the first woman doctor I've ever met, and now you're here, and you should practice.”\nNora Mathison: April says Father Merino was probably acting on his politics here as a member of the National Liberals, the dominant political party at the time. The National Liberals were all about modernizing. \nApril Mayes: Part of what it means to be a progressive interested in modernizing the Dominican Republic, is supporting women's education.\nNora Mathison: Women's education and the idea of modern medicine. \nApril Mayes: “We need more professional, trained, educated people now we're going to call doctors instead of the curanderas and the curanderos.” \nNora Mathison: Curanderas meaning healers. So in Sarah, Father Merino saw an opportunity. \nApril Mayes: So with Doc Sarah, he got a two-fer right? He's in a win-win situation, he's got someone with training with certificates, who's a professional, who's a scientist, right? Who's a doctor, and he's got a woman. \nNora Mathison: And he taught her not just conversational Spanish, but the technical Spanish needed to pass the medical exam.\nLess than a year after arriving in the Dominican Republic, in the spring of 1883, Sarah took her medical exams in Spanish, and she passed. She was given a certificate authorizing her to treat women and children. \nIt was so unprecedented to have a woman practicing medicine, that the Congress of the Dominican Republic actually had to pass a rule stating that she, Sarah specifically, not all women, was allowed to practice there.\nAnd when Congress made that exception, Doctor Sarah Loguen Fraser became the first woman licensed to practice medicine in the Dominican Republic.\nKeep in mind that within about a year, she left her medical practice in Washington, D.C., got married, moved to the Dominican Republic, learned Spanish, passed exams in Spanish to get her Dominican medical license. Oh, and she had a baby, but we'll get to that. \nIt's clear she was driven, but there were other things at play that set Sarah apart from other women aspiring to medicine. Certainly connections like the Douglass family didn't hurt. After all, she had a former president tutoring her. \nApril Mayes: We're talking about a family that is at the upper echelon of Puerto Plata society. Charles makes friends with the most important political people of the period.\nNora Mathison: But April says it wasn't just the connections. Something else was at play. \nApril Mayes: Neither Charles, nor Doc Sarah would necessarily be considered Black in the Dominican Republic. \nNora Mathison: Remember, Sarah, from a multiracial family, is described as having light skin.\nAnd her husband, Charles Fraser, you'll recall, is also biracial. \nApril Mayes: In the Dominican Republic, which is a country of majority African descended, they're not dark skinned people. They're biracial or mixed race people. It places them higher in the social hierarchy than would be possible elsewhere, say like in the United States.\nNora Mathison: In the U.S., the “one drop rule” meant that a person was considered Black if they had any Black ancestry. All Black people were, by custom and law, subjected to anti black racism. But now, in the Dominican Republic, historian April Mayes suspects that being biracial did affect Sarah's status. It gave her certain privileges. \nWith her new license in hand, Sarah started practicing medicine.\nBecause she was restricted to treating women and children, her specialty was pediatrics and obstetrics with a focus on labor and delivery. \nApril Mayes: Birth was dangerous. I mean, the closest to death that many women would ever get to was during birth and delivery.\nNora Mathison: And Sarah saw the danger firsthand, according to her daughter.\nApril Mayes: One time a neighbor was giving birth and the child's legs were coming first. So it was a breech birth. And Doc Sarah stayed with that woman for two days. And as the way that Gregoria describes it, put the leg back in, turned the baby's body. So the head came out first, both child and mother survived. \nNora Mathison: And Sarah didn't just witness difficult births. She delivered her daughter, Gregoria, in December of 1883. \nApril Mayes: And her birth experience was so horrible, and what happened to her physically was so bad, that she lost the ability to have any more children.\nNora Mathison: After that, according to Gregoria, Sarah worked to ensure that other women wouldn't have to endure anything like her childbirth experience.\nSo Sarah lived and worked in Puerto Plata for the next decade, treating women and children and raising Gregoria. By all accounts, as a licensed doctor trained in the latest techniques in the United States, she was highly respected. \nThen, on September 28th, 1894, her husband, age 58, had a stroke. He died two days later. Sarah, age 44, grieved not just for Charles, but for the end of childhood for their daughter, 10 year old Gregoria. \nSarah gave up her practice, and for a while, she ran Charles’ pharmacy. And though she'd spent a decade building a life in the Dominican Republic, in 1897, Sarah and her daughter moved back to Washington, D.C. to be near family, and to get the now teenaged Gregoria a better education.\nApril Mayes: But when she comes back to the United States, Gregoria faces an entirely different racial landscape than her mother did.\nNora Mathison: Just before Sarah and Gregoria returned, the U.S. Supreme Court formally legalized segregation with Plessy v. Ferguson. The doctrine of Separate but Equal was now officially the law of the land. \nApril Mayes: By the early 1900s, we are at a moment of heightened racist terrorism against African Americans, particularly in the south.\nNora Mathison: Sarah, who had reaped the benefits of American higher education, now had a hard time finding quality schooling for her daughter.\nWith few options under Separate but Equal, she sent Gregoria to boarding school in France, something only a privileged few could afford. \nSarah herself also struggled. She had some success as a private practitioner, but couldn't get traction when she looked for work within institutions. And she was multilingual, with nearly two decades of experience and two medical degrees.\nFinally, 14 years after the death of Charles, things seemed to be turning around. \nApril Mayes: In 1908, she obtained a government appointment to be the resident physician at Blue Plains Industrial School for Boys in Southeastern D.C. \nHowever, when she arrived, they changed her job description, and she ended up serving more as a matron to 14 boys, which meant that she spent her days cooking, cleaning, washing, and ironing. And, it didn't take long for Gregoria to show up and rescue her mother from that work.\nNora Mathison: In 1911, Sarah bought a house in D.C. She likely paid for it with pharmacy earnings, as well as the proceeds from the sale of Fraser family properties. \nGregoria, then in her mid 30s, soon moved in with her mother.\nWhen Gregoria married John Goins in 1917, he joined them, too. Gregoria says that her mother loved John, and the family seems to have lived happily there for years. \nTowards the end of Dr. Sarah Loguen Fraser's life, she finally did get some recognition.\nOne account says that In 1926, on the 50th anniversary of Sarah’s own medical school graduation, Howard University invited her as a guest of honor at their alumni dinner. By then, she was in her mid 70s, and had dedicated over 30 years to practicing medicine. She was not a Howard alum, but the school recognized and honored her accomplishments as part of a cohort of Black female doctors who shifted people's thinking.\nHere again is medical historian Meg Vigil Fowler. \nMeg Vigil-Fowler: In an era when, there's all these ideas that sort of Black people and women are not fit for intellectual work, just their presence really challenges those ideas. And, even though their numbers are few, anytime a patient went to them, they saw an example of a Black woman physician.\nNora Mathison: It's hard to know whether Dr. Sarah Loguen Fraser viewed herself as an inspiring role model or even as a pioneering physician. But for Sarah, this career helping black women and children was just the kind of work she had set her mind to years ago, ever since seeing that young boy at the train station under a wagon wheel and being unable to help.\nIn her journal, she wrote, “To have those of my race come to me for aid, and for me to be able to give it, will be all the heaven I want.”\nBy the late 1920s, Sarah had developed kidney disease and severe memory loss. With her daughter Gregoria at her side, she died in 1933 at the age of 83. But the story doesn't end there.\nDr. Sarah Loguen Fraser may not have been a household name in the United States at the time of her death, but when word reached Puerto Plata, there was deep mourning. \nApril Mayes: For nine days, flags in the city were flown at half mast and a high mass was held for her at the Catholic church in Puerto Plata itself.\nNora Mathison: Later, her daughter, Gregoria, started putting pen to paper to document her mother's life. In 1939, she went back to Puerto Plata and was overwhelmed by the number of people who remembered her mother. Gregoria writes:\nApril Mayes: “I spent 10 months in Puerto Plata, and not a week passed that someone did not come bringing gifts of flowers, fruits, sweetmeats, the donors saying, “Your mother operated on my daughter and she was made well.” “I would've had consumption, but your mother taught my mother what to do.” Or, “Your mother treated my father and took no pay. I still appreciate her kindness.”\nNora Mathison: Looking back to the tintype portrait thought to be Sarah, described at the very start of the episode – the woman in a cape holding a doctor's bag – there's really no way to know for sure whether it is Sarah. But that tintype stands as a testament, not just to the life of Dr. Sarah Loguen Fraser, but to this small cohort of Black women who, in a fortuitous moment in history, became doctors just after the Civil War. Their contributions rippled through the medical field in ways we'll never fully know. \nI’m Nora Mathison.\nKatie Hafner: Nora Mathison produced this episode, for Lost Women of Science, along with producer Ashraya Gupta, Managing Senior Producer Barbara Howard, and Associate Producer Dominique Janee.\nWe’d like to thank April Mayes, Meg Vigil-Fowler, Elise DeAndrea and Doctor Gertrude Fraser for helping us with research.\nOur audio engineer is Hansdale Hsu and Lizzie Younan composes our music.\nThanks as always to Amy Scharf and Jeff DelViscio.\nWe are funded in part by the Alfred P.

{"title": "Classifying Heat Waves Will Help People Better Understand Their Dangers", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nClimate change is making heat waves stronger and longer. Naming and ranking them like we do with hurricanes will make governments, companies and people take hot days more seriously\nRecently, I interviewed a DoorDash driver named Britni Duwii for a story about the dangers of extreme heat. Britni worked in Mesa, Ariz., which, at the time, was under a weeks-long heat advisory. The average temperature in July was a blistering 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Sometimes, Britni told me, she had to endure long shifts in her car with the air conditioner broken. Heat would exhaust her so much that she would often pass out on the couch as soon as she got home from work. She knew heat was dangerous (exhaustion is an early sign of heatstroke), but she simply couldn’t afford to miss work.\nShe isn’t the only person facing this dilemma. Heat is now the deadliest weather effect in the U.S. It kills more people per year than hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported at least 1,710 heat-related deaths, and researchers have consistently found deaths increase on extreme heat days. In 2019, one study found 1,373 additional deaths could be attributed to extreme heat days in the U.S. each year. In July, another study estimated that last year there were 60,000 heat-related deaths in Europe.\nThis summer, many people died across the nation while doing everyday tasks in the heat: gardening, walking and delivering mail. The anecdotes and data show how risky heat is, but also how people, governments and corporations tend to not take its risks of harm as seriously. As climate change makes heat waves longer and stronger, we must find new ways to communicate their dangers. The National Weather Service needs to reconsider its stance on naming or ranking extreme heat, the same way it does with hurricanes.\nThe debate over whether to name heat waves has been going on for several years. Some skeptical scientists say, because heat waves vary in length, intensity and geography, classifying them will create an enormous administrative burden. They also say the temperature is relative—heat risk depends on how much a city, and even a person, can adapt to heat. For instance, while 94 percent of homes in Arizona have air conditioning, only 53 percent of homes in Washington state do, so the risk of heat-related illness can vary across states even if the weather conditions are the same.\nBut some researchers are already working on classifying heat waves based on a city’s weather and mortality data. In my view, we need clearer guidelines precisely because of how unequal heat risk is; whatever the standard ends up being, giving a heat wave a name or a number tells people that this is weather they need to take seriously. People tend to underestimate how dangerous heat is, so without the alert that a ranking gives, I worry that people with greater privileges will dismiss the heat’s health risks and ignore the people struggling to withstand it.\nPeople living in warm climates often disregard heat-related health hazards since they believe they are used to extreme weather. Although older people have less capacity to regulate their body temperature, surveys have shown they don’t fear heat any more than do younger people. Peter Howe, an environmental social scientist at Utah State University, told me two types of people die from heat stroke: those with underlying conditions that make them vulnerable to heat, and healthy people in risky situations, like those working outdoors.\nAlthough heat waves are destructive, they don’t leave massive and immediate trails of debris in the same way a tornado or hurricane does. Nevertheless, the U.S. could end up spending tens of billions more per year for road maintenance and replacement as a consequence of high temperatures.\nCategorizing heat waves, whether by name or number, could transform the way we think about heat. It could help us differentiate between the regular weather forecast and weather conditions that put our lives and economies in danger. A category system would be easier to understand than the traditional heat index measure, and each category could also offer some guidance on which activities should and shouldn’t continue under given weather conditions, like with the air quality index.\nChanging how we communicate heat risk might make corporations more accountable for protecting their employees, instead of claiming, as some have done, that it is up to individual employees to know when to stop working in extreme heat. Scientists have consistently found people with low resources are often aware of heat’s risks since they are often struggling with it. But understanding dangerous weather conditions doesn’t mean much if you can’t choose to stay safe. This gap between understanding heat risk and avoiding it became crystal clear in the summer of 2022 when a video of a UPS driver collapsing in the heat and then finishing a delivery after a few moments went viral. After this happened, UPS told reporters that its drivers were “trained to work outdoors and for the effects of hot weather.” But UPS would never say its drivers are “trained” to work outdoors and for the effects of a tornado.\nBesides being an invisible weather disaster, heat is also a long-term hazard, and some researchers worry naming heat waves would put too much emphasis on extraordinary heat events instead of on the chronic effects of heat, which can be just as dangerous. “I have been working in communities that have had significant health impacts from heat but did not have extreme heat waves,” says Olga Wilhelmi, a geographer studying extreme heat risks at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\nBut changing how we communicate heat risk might also give us an excuse to keep talking about heat’s long-term hazards. We could address these “acute emergency challenges” and also keep working to address heat’s long-term effects, Kurt Shickman, the former director of Extreme Heat Initiatives at the Adrienne Arsht–Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, told me. The center has been working on naming and classifying heat waves. Its researchers have found, for instance, that people are more likely to remember heat waves when they have been named. \nThe heat we experienced this summer was the most relentless in our history, and chances are things will keep getting worse. Heat is not a reason to put on shorts and eat ice cream anymore; it has become a credible life threat, especially to the most vulnerable members of our communities. The way authorities talk about heat urgently needs to reflect that change.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nGina Jiménez is a New York–based bilingual journalist.

{"title": "Precision Medicine Has Been Overhyped", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nA new book argues that genomics is overshadowing environmental and social solutions to better health for all\nDuring the past two decades or so, personalized medicine has gotten a lot of hype. The promise is this: researchers can use a person’s genetic data to help guide disease treatment and, in some cases, extend that person’s life expectancy when they are sick. The concept seems to make a lot of sense—nobody wants impersonal or imprecise medicine, and advocates point to success stories such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a personalized immunotherapy that has proved useful against certain cancers. But as James Tabery argues in his new book, Tyranny of the Gene, genetically customized drug regimens are not as effective or widely applicable as they are made out to be.\nTabery, a professor of philosophy at University of Utah, who focuses on medical ethics, saw the promise of personalized medicine when his father was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small-cell lung cancer in August 2011. After a test revealed that the cancerous cells had a certain molecular marker, Tabery’s father was prescribed a treatment that could target the cells accordingly. The tumors shrank, and he lived for 13 months. It’s impossible to know “how much time the drugs added to the end of my father’s life, but there is every reason to believe he lived longer because of them,” Tabery says. Looking back at the experience a few years later, however, he is unconvinced that such efforts are the best route to better health.\nScientific American spoke to Tabery about his motivation for chronicling the rise of personalized medicine and the reasons he thinks paying attention to the environment might have a bigger impact on health care.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nHow would you describe the difference between personalized and precision medicine?\nThe vision of personalized medicine that was portrayed to the public from about 1997 to 2007 was that [researchers] took your genome and, in return, gave you a tailor-made drug. Precision medicine is just a personalized medicine [rebranding that was done] by the genetics community in 2011 because they were concerned that the language of “personalized” was confusing people. Now there are two confusing terms out there, neither of which are entirely accurate.\nWe’re told that precision medicine gets at causes, whereas traditional medicine does not, and that it gives us diagnostic clarity and accuracy in a way that traditional medicine did not. What’s misleading about that is it’s an illusion that all those problems [of uncertainty and differing treatment recommendations] go away.\nWhat makes personalized, or precision, medicine seem so promising?\nIt sounds intuitively attractive. We like the warm, fuzzy feeling that each of us is unique and each of us is different. But it’s not like personalized medicine is astrology or snake oil. There are clear cases where people today are alive—taking medicines that are a result of this genomic revolution—whereas 10 to 20 years ago they would be dead. The classic example is people who have chronic myelogenous leukemia and take Gleevec [a treatment that extends life expectancy for people with this disease by at least five years].\nI certainly don’t want to suggest that we should diminish the fact that those people are living longer. The concern on my part is that I think these [successes] are exceptions. When you move out of the space of rare diseases and cancers, it becomes increasingly difficult to see where [personalized medicine] gets the same kind of purchase.\nThe things that lead to most illness and death in society––forms of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] or obesity––this personalized medicine stuff is not going to help them. [But people who have these conditions] are being lured by doctors and pharmaceutical companies into a view that it will. For instance, researchers are going into communities of color and saying, “Help us battle racial health disparities by giving us your DNA.” I find it really troubling because there’s all this evidence that suggests the causes of health disparities are not in our DNA; they’re in our environments. I worry that it’s both misleading and distracting from research that could actually be done to focus on the things that are causing the illness.\nMuch of your book chronicles how, in the past two and a half decades, the National Institutes of Health gravitated toward genetics research rather than research on environmental and social factors that affect health. Why is this history important?\nA historical lens is always helpful for understanding how we got to the place we are today. The competition [between genetics research and environmental research] that played out at the National Institutes of Health since the late 1990s illustrates this other path that we could have taken, where we [could have gone] all in on asking: What are the environmental contributions to health and illness? For instance, I think we need to give more support to researchers who are doing social and behavioral research on how racism actually [affects health] and what sort of interventions can be done to combat racism in the workplace or in schools.\nYou focus a lot on the expense of precision medicine. How does it exacerbate inequality?\nThe way personalized medicine works is: you get information from patients about their genomics, and what follows is pharmacogenetics, which is, essentially, you get this drug based on how you metabolize drugs. In the circumstances where personalized medicine does work [on rare diseases and cancers], both the genetic tests and the drugs themselves are astronomically priced. For a small number of people [for whom] personalized medicine is relevant to their health condition, they’re going to be staring down the barrel of really expensive treatments [that likely would not be fully covered by insurance].\nThe drugs cost lots of money because they’re going to a smaller number of people, compared with the cost of giving the same drug to everyone. It tends to disadvantage people who are already marginalized because now they’ve got this additional economic barrier.\nThe example in my introductory chapter is the lung cancer case. We’ve long known that the best shot at combating lung cancer is catching it early and surgically removing it before it’s metastasized. Once it’s metastasized, the prognosis is really bad. But Black people were getting these surgeries less often than white people. And when you move to the era of personalized medicine, Black people are getting tested for whether or not a drug is a good fit for them less often than white people. People from poor neighborhoods are getting tested less often than people from wealthier neighborhoods.\nI do give the genetics community credit because they are very tuned in to this problem. They are worried about it.\nHow do you think personalized medicine will evolve?\nThere’s no sign of it slowing down—it’s exploding. There’s this idea now that we should do whole-genome sequencing on every baby born in the U.S., the argument being that if we’re able to catch any rare diseases early, then maybe we could treat them earlier. Is that realistic?\nAs the price of doing genomic sequencing continues to drop, and the financial value of getting more and more data goes up, there’s this huge bipartisan support for genomics. Meanwhile you’ve got Republican presidential candidates calling for eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. This sort of drives home for me how there’s all this momentum for [genetics research and personalized medicine], and there are all these headwinds for [researching environmental health factors]. As we become increasingly politically polarized, doing things on the environmental side––whether that’s intervention or research––is going to be tough.\nHannah Docter-Loeb is a freelance writer based in Washington, D.C.\nKern Hendricks, Tulika Bose, Michael Lester and Jason Drakeford\nAndrea Thompson\nJeff Tollefson and Nature magazine\nJean Chemnick and E&E News\nSophie Bushwick\nKatie Weeman\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "How Family Trauma Perpetuates Authoritarian Societies", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nPioneering scholar Riane Eisler describes her lifelong quest to understand why warlike societies are the norm\nWhy are some societies warlike, and why are some peaceable? New scholarship suggests that societies can be arranged in a spectrum ranging from domination-based to partnership-based. Every relationship in a dominator society, whether between parent and child, husband and wife, political leader and citizen or citizen and noncitizen, is authoritarian and coercive, whereas in a partnership society, relationships are life-sustaining and egalitarian. Further, dominator societies—the canonical example of which is Nazi Germany—are warlike and propelled by trauma, whereas partnership societies are more caring and peaceable. And childhood experiences help explain how such societies arise and perpetuate themselves.\nSocial systems scientist Riane Eisler, one of the most original thinkers of our time, and anthropologist Douglas Fry pull together insights from psychology, social science, anthropology, neuroscience and history to make this case in the book Nurturing Our Humanity (Oxford University Press, 2019). “This whole-system approach,” Eisler says, “recognizes that families do not arise in a vacuum but are embedded in, affect and are affected by the larger culture or subculture of which they are part.”\nNurturing our Humanity synthesizes ideas that Eisler, now in her early 90s, developed over a lifetime of research and sketched out in her best-known book, The Chalice and the Blade (HarperCollins, 1987). Described by one commentator as the “most important book since Darwin’s Origin of Species,” this pathbreaking work expanded upon the discoveries of pioneering archeologist Marija Gimbutas and others to posit that early European societies, such as the Minoan civilization, were led by priestesses but were egalitarian rather than matriarchal. Far from representing the flip side of patriarchy—with one gender still dominating another—these societies, Eisler argued, were partnerships in which men and women enjoyed nurturing relationships of equality, prosperity and peace with one another and with their neighbors. Starting around 6,500 years ago, these “partnership” societies were destroyed by invasions that converted Europe to patriarchal and warlike “dominator” societies that have since prevailed.\n“In the course of this work, I realized how traumatized I had been by political and social events,” Eisler says. “I also began to see how families that cause trauma are, and have long been, a mechanism for reproducing authoritarian, punitive, violent, male-dominated cultures.” In 1987 Eisler and her husband, David Elliot Loye, founded what is now called the Center for Partnership Systems, which seeks to propel society toward a partnership-oriented system. Scientific American spoke with Eisler about her decades of investigation.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nHow did your childhood experiences influence your lifelong quest to understand the inner workings of society?\nAs a child, I witnessed great evil, but I also witnessed spiritual courage because my mother stood up to the Nazis. It was on Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. I was seven years old and at home with my parents in Vienna. For some reason, my mother didn’t send me to school that day. Things were very tense by then. I’d already seen how bearded old Jews were made to scrub the sidewalk right by our house, on their knees, by Nazis who laughed at them.\nMy father had a wholesale cutlery business, and my mother worked there. When the Nazis came that night, she recognized one of them as a former errand boy of the business. He was an Austrian Nazi, one of those who welcomed Hitler’s invasion of Austria. She got furious at him. She demanded, “How dare you do this to this man who has been so good to you?”\nI have blocked so much of the actual memory, as people who are traumatized do. All I know is that they were there, and they pushed my father down the stairs. There were about five of them. Some were in uniform. My mother could have been killed for challenging them, but instead the head of the operation said to my mother, “Give us this much money. I can’t give him back to you now, but if you bring it to Gestapo headquarters, I’ll give him back to you.”\nMy mother obtained not only my father’s release but also a safe conduit. If they came back for him, she could show them a document that meant that he was not to be taken away. If it hadn’t been for her, my father would have been taken to a concentration camp. He would never have been released. And we would have waited, and eventually we would have been taken away, too. So my mother basically saved all of our lives.\nYou could have cut the fear in our home. People my parents knew had been killed. My parents desperately wanted to leave. But they had a sort of a catch-22. You couldn’t get steamship tickets out of Europe until you had a visa somewhere. And you couldn’t get a visa until you had a steamship ticket. It just calls for bribery. My parents weren’t rich, but fortunately they had the money to do that.\nThey had an acquaintance in New York, and they were on the phone, trying to get some kind of guarantee that they wouldn’t be a burden. But they couldn’t get into the U.S. because they were born in [the region of] Bukovina, a part of the Austrian Empire that became Romania after World War I [and that is now in present-day Romania and Ukraine]. There were only two places in the world where Jews who couldn’t get into the U.S. were admitted; one of them was Cuba. And we eventually got entry papers for Cuba.\nHow long were you in that house waiting for papers to come through?\nWe waited a couple of months in our apartment, which had blue velvet curtains that I remember because I loved the feel of them. I remember our fleeing very well because it was at night, with only what we could carry. My mother was so traumatized that she forgot her jewelry at home. So distant relatives went back for it—two people who I think were both later killed. They came back with the jewelry, and one of them lit a cigarette, and it somehow set my hair on fire. Who can forget that?\nWe got on a train to Paris. I remember being in a hotel room in Paris, all alone, because my parents had to go to some consulates, and I was so afraid that they wouldn’t come back. We went to see the movie Snow White, and I was terrified because I was a traumatized child already. I don’t know what terrified me. It was in English, which I understood because they sent me to a bilingual kindergarten.\nWhen we arrived in Cuba, my mother sold some of her jewelry so that I could go to a private school, Central Methodist School. And then when it was time to go to high school, they sent me to another private school in the suburbs. This one was run by some British women who were also bilingual.\nBut I was always an outsider. Being an outsider was very, very hard, but I would say that it served me well because it made it possible for me to think outside the box. I very early realized that what we consider “just the way things are” is not the same everywhere. It’s one way in Vienna, another in Cuba and yet another in the U.S.\nThere was a lot of antisemitism in Cuba. I remember standing at the pier, looking out at the ocean liner St. Louis. We were on one of the last ships before Cuba turned the St. Louis back [with Jewish refugees from Europe]. There was a movie made about the St. Louis called Voyage of the Damned. And they were damned—nobody, not the U.S., no country in the Western Hemisphere would let them land. They all had purchased entry permits, just as we had, but suddenly, in collusion with the Nazis, they were turned back.\nWe stayed in the industrial slums of Havana. It was terrifying. There were street children yelling, “Polaca!” at me. I was Austrian, Viennese, but the first Jewish immigrants had been from Poland, and the Nazis fomented a tremendous campaign against Jews.\nI had some friends at school, but I couldn’t bring them to my home in the slums. My high school was an exclusive school where wealthy Cubans’ children got an English education.\nBut there was one early class by a teacher named Mrs. Kirby in Central Methodist School. She gave me the first inkling that there was such a thing as prehistory. And I was absolutely fascinated. I was a very curious child. In the Bible, it says, “Henceforth, women will be subservient to men.” And I always wanted to know: What was it like before the “henceforth”?\nDidn’t you get any Jewish religious training?\nYes, because my parents found out that I had to go to chapel. You see, I was in a Methodist school. I got so tired of being the only kid that didn’t raise their hand when asked, “Do you believe in Jesus?” I mean, how old was I? Eight or nine. So I raised my hand, and my parents got wind of this, and they hired a rabbi to teach me that I’m Jewish. Obviously, I was very well aware that I’m Jewish, I mean, after all that had happened.\nI asked the rabbi what it was like before the “henceforth.” And he didn’t like that. I also wanted to know why, in the story of Eve and Adam, Eve asked a snake for advice. I later discovered the answers to my questions. Snakes were a symbol of oracular prophecy. Remember the Oracle of Delphi [in Ancient Greece]? She worked with a snake to put herself in an oracular trance. Eve asked the snake for advice because that part of the story was the old reality, when women were asking, as priestesses, for oracular advice from a snake.\nCan a snake bite give you a transcendental experience?\nI believe so. Remember the Minoan goddess-priestess figurines—they have snakes coiled around their arms and are in an oracular trance.\nLet’s get back to your story.\nEventually we did come to the U.S., and I remember the disappointment. In Florida, which was our landing point, the segregation and the poverty were awful. We moved to New York City, and it was really overwhelming for all of us. Then we settled in Los Angeles.\nI went down to the L.A. Board of Education and explained to them that I didn’t want to finish 10th grade, and I asked if they could please let me into 11th grade. They did, and it was a terribly boring time, because my education up to that point had been really good. In college I majored in anthropology and sociology, and then I started law school.\nI wanted to leave home. My parents informed me that a good Jewish girl only left home when she’s married. So I got married to someone I had nothing in common with. We were both traumatized. He was a Hungarian refugee. I was an Austrian refugee. I wanted love. He dealt with trauma by becoming divorced from feelings. We had two wonderful daughters, but I had no skills for parenting.\nI was a homemaker in the suburbs of Los Angeles, and I was fascinated with the Eleusinian mysteries [a secret rite in ancient Greece that initiated people into the cult of Demeter and Persephone]. Demeter has a daughter, Persephone, who has to go to the underworld for six months. And that’s why we have winter: it’s cold and dark for six months because Demeter, who is the goddess of the earth, is in mourning. When Persephone comes back, it is spring and summer. And I began to wonder: How is it that we’ve never been taught about powerful women?\nThen the questions of my childhood came up because I always wanted to know, “Does it really have to be this way?” I witnessed the terrible cruelty and violence of the Nazis. But I also witnessed love because my mother stood up against injustice out of love. And so the question was: When we have the capacity for both of these things, what has pulled so much of so-called civilization toward destructiveness? That’s really when I started the research for The Chalice and the Blade.\nDid you write the book while you were at home with the children?\nNo, no. My life is like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle coming together. I went back to law school on my way out of my first marriage because I needed a meal ticket. I got a part-time job as an attorney because I had little children. I quit my marriage, my job and smoking within three months and threw myself into the counterculture. It was like a rubber band stretched to its limits, breaking.\nI’d always thought there was something wrong with me because I didn’t fit into this role of the little woman behind the successful man. We’d go to cocktail parties, which was the thing you did in those days, and they’d ask you, “What do you do?” And I’d say, “I’m just a housewife and a mother,” as if this were nothing. I thought of myself that way until the late 1960s, when I suddenly woke up.\nI wrote a play, Infinity, and then a screenplay. And I got a contract to write Dissolution: No-Fault Divorce, Marriage, and the Future of Women [McGraw-Hill, 1977]. It was around 1969, 1970 when the feminist movement got going. I became very, very active in the women’s and feminist movement. I backed into divorce law through the Los Angeles Women’s Center Legal Program, which I founded. I predicted that no-fault divorces would lead to what was later called the feminization of poverty. When middle-class women used to get divorces, they always got alimony because there was a fault. No-fault divorce was a fairer law because fault had often been made up—but it wasn’t a level playing field. What happened with no-fault divorce was that women were not getting alimony and were dropping into poverty with their children because the work of care that women did wasn’t valued or paid.\nAfter that book, I had a physical and mental breakdown. My father died suddenly, and I’m an only child. And that was a fraught relationship. I went back to Dachau. I had to see [the concentration camp]. And I read the book Treblinka [by Jean-François Steiner]. I just had to get into what really happened.\nIn a sense, that was healing. But six months after my father died, I found my mother sitting dead by the phone trying to ask for help. She’d obviously had a heart attack. And I wasn’t there to help her. I became terribly depressed. I had to give up my law practice and give all my clients to somebody else. I couldn’t do it anymore.\nThen I met David [Elliot Loye]. We fell in love, and we spent the next 45 years literally together. He really saved my life. I didn’t want to tell him how sick I was. But he knew, and he decided that it was his mission to make me whole. I was writing The Chalice and the Blade, but I didn’t really show it to him until 1984. I was invited to the former Soviet Union to be one of two American delegates to Nordic Women for Peace. In case something happened to me, I left the manuscript with him. And he loved it.\nIt was three times as long as the published version, and he helped me cut it. He just believed in me. He had a Ph.D. in social psychology, and I learned a lot from him. And of course, Chalice made a splash. A lot of books are now coming out going over the same kind of territory, basically showing that there were what I call partnership-oriented societies for millennia.\nHow did you shift from focusing on patriarchy to domination in society?\nI realized there never was a matriarchy. The whole idea that the opposite of patriarchy is matriarchy is just another side of a domination coin.\nThe first two books that I wrote on the topic, The Chalice and the Blade and Sacred Pleasure, were me trying to figure out: How did it get to this crazy place? Sacred Pleasure foreshadows everything else I’ve written. It is very personal. And it is about how sexuality and spirituality were transformed by domination. It was at that point that I started to really think about children. And then I wrote a book on education—because I had to know: How do we change this? Education is one of the mechanisms for perpetuating social norms. That book is Tomorrow’s Children.\nThen I wrote a book that won a Nautilus Book Award for being the best self-help book of the year: The Power of Partnership. It looks at seven relationships and how they’re different, depending on the degree of orientation to either end of the partner-domination scale. It starts with how we relate to ourselves, and then it examines our family and intimate relations, our work and community relations and relations with nature because it’s all of one piece.\nAfter that came The Real Wealth of Nations. I proposed an economic system that considers nonmarket work. The problem isn’t socialism, and it isn’t capitalism—it’s that the ethos behind both is the domination ethos. Both Adam Smith and Karl Marx accepted the distinction between “just” reproductive work and productive work. And they both focused on the market. For them, the work of caring for children, starting at birth, was supposed to be done for free by a woman in a male-controlled household and hence is called reproductive. In the Real Wealth of Nations, I point out that both socialism and capitalism leave out the three life-sustaining nonmarket sectors of the economy: the natural economy, the volunteer community economy and the household economy.\nWhen Marx wrote during the 1800s, do you know that a wife could not sue for injuries that were negligently inflicted on her? Only her husband could sue—for loss of her services. People don’t know their history, much less their law. You can use the law to maintain domination. Or you can use it to move toward a more egalitarian, more peaceful, more gender-balanced world. And so my theme in Nurturing Our Humanity has been that what children experience or observe is primary, and it isn’t just a children’s, just a family, issue. It’s a social and economic issue. And I think that’s one of my most important contributions, frankly.\nWhat role does trauma play?\nI didn't really start thinking about trauma until I did the research for Nurturing Our Humanity. The adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) studies on the long-term negative consequences of childhood adversity were revelatory. In my eclectic, whole-systems way, I came across the work of [psychologists] Michael Milburn and Sheree Conrad, which documented how children from punitive families are often drawn to political leaders who deflect repressed pain and anger against those they perceive as weak and evil. Milburn and Conrad found that this punitive agenda is especially pronounced in men. They attribute this to a male socialization that requires men to deny fear, pain, and empathy and focus instead on anger and contempt as culturally appropriate “masculine” emotions.\nGender socialization makes people equate the differences between them with dominating or being dominated, with superiority and inferiority, with being served and serving. Given this connection between difference and domination, it’s not coincidental that you have antisemitism or that you have racism. There is always an in-group and an out-group.\nHow does the system reproduce itself?\nBy observation and by experience. It’s a very punitive family, the dominator family. I think what happens in a traumatized child is denial and identification, instead, with the strong parent and blaming of the weak child. The denial—that there’s anything bad that your parents or your caregivers did to you—is then channeled through this in-group versus out-group thinking that domination-oriented religion provides. It is a mixture of psychological mechanisms of denial and of displacement. You can’t acknowledge that the people on top, whom you depend on for food, a roof over your head and the care you get, are punitive.\nThis confluence of caring and coercion is lethal. It causes the displacement to the out-group. But the out-group, except for the out-group of women, varies. I think we’re all traumatized by the domination system, frankly. And what passes for normal in some communities is a traumatized state.\nWe urgently need new partnership norms that recognize scientific findings that “human nature” is very capable of caring. Whether this capacity is or is not expressed is determined not by genes alone but by the interaction of genes with our environment, which for humans is primarily the cultural environment. So it became my life’s mission, along with David’s, to propagate more caring partnership cultures that value and reward the “women’s work” of caring.\nDavid was the love of my life, my partner and my best friend. And he died last year, two days after the 45th anniversary of the day we met, which we always celebrated. Still, I’m blessed because I live in a beautiful place, and I am still able to think and to write and to do things.\nMadhusree Mukerjee is a senior editor at Scientific American. Credit: Nick Higgins\nKern Hendricks, Tulika Bose, Michael Lester and Jason Drakeford\nAndrea Thompson\nJeff Tollefson and Nature magazine\nJean Chemnick and E&E News\nSophie Bushwick\nKatie Weeman\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Don't Blame AI. Plagiarism Is Turning Digital News into Hot Garbage", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nA botched obituary underlines threats from both artificial intelligence and digital plagiarism mills to pollute the news with misinformation\nFew editors would call someone “useless” in a headline. Fewer still would do it in an obituary. Yet when a former NBA basketball player collapsed and died this week, there it was, emblazoned on the MSN website: “Brandon Hunter useless at 42.”\nThose who read further quickly realized that something was deeply wrong with the article; the anonymous editor who wrote it seemed almost, but not quite, totally unfamiliar with the way the English language works. “Hunter’s expertise led to his choice because the 56th general decide within the 2003 NBA Draft,” the obituary explained. “Throughout his NBA profession, he performed in 67 video games over two seasons and achieved a career-high of 17 factors in a recreation in opposition to the Milwaukee Bucks in 2004.”\nAstute readers realized that the editor was likely a machine. “AI should not be writing obituaries,” wrote one outraged sports fan on X/Twitter. “Pay your damn writers @MSN.” Though the first reporters on the scene speculated that the obituary was “seemingly AI generated,” the truth is a bit more mundane. Indeed, the crudeness of the algorithm that embarrassed MSN shows just what makes modern media outlets so vulnerable to AI misinformation.\nThe computer program that generated the Brandon Hunter obituary is probably a relic rather than cutting-edge AI (through a spokesperson, MSN declined to answer questions). For more than a decade, unscrupulous website designers have been using software called “article spinners” to create novel-seeming content out of stolen words. At their simplest, these programs mask plagiarism through liberal use of a thesaurus; replace enough words with synonyms and hopefully nobody will ever find the original source.\nThe Brandon Hunter obit overindulged on the Roget’s, yet it’s still possible to find the original obituary, “Brandon Hunter dead at 42,” published on a small specialist website TalkBasket.net (which, in turn, is quite similar to this story from TMZ). “Hunter’s talent led to his selection as the 56th overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft,” the article states. “During his NBA career, he played in 67 games over two seasons and achieved a career-high of 17 points in a game against the Milwaukee Bucks in 2004.” Compare that with the MSN version, and it becomes obvious how ham-handed—and simple—the spinner algorithm was.\nThough any human editor would instantly throw such an article in the digital trash, over the past week, MSN has published dozens of these plagiarized-and-synonymized articles about such diverse subjects as sports (“[Manchester United player Jadon] Sancho was affected by an harm for a interval of the five-month stretch from October when he didn’t characteristic for United.”), auto-buying advice (“Nevertheless, presuming the funds permits just one, we might begin by discounting the primary two generations, as a result of they’re now nicely stricken in years, so to discover a good one means procuring very fastidiously.”), and business (“Normal Motors’ first wage-and-benefit supply to the United Auto Staff on Thursday fell far in need of the union’s preliminary calls for.”) Until the “useless” headline sparked outrage, nobody at MSN seemed to realize that their news page was larded with gobbledygook. (All these articles and numerous others have since been removed.)\nThe article spinner that hit MSN is mere decades-old computer wrangling, not modern machine learning. Modern AI—such as ChatGPT—is so good at grammar and syntax, in contrast, that it can write faster and better than many human editors. And the plagiarism that these AI algorithms partake in is so subtle that it outdoes plagiarism in the ordinary sense: it takes other people’s work and synthesizes sources in ways typically untraceable.\nStill, AI can’t have novel insights, nor can it generate new information that isn’t already fed into its electronic brain. However, it can craft an extremely convincing facsimile of news.\nWhen I asked ChatGPT to write an obituary for Hunter, for example, the prose was grammatically clean. Sterile, even. Absent of any new information, and so full of cliches that it could never offend anyone, even by accident. “His prowess, tenacity, and charismatic personality left an indelible mark on the game and on those who had the privilege of watching him play....” the algorithm disgorged. “He established the Brandon Hunter Foundation, a charitable organization aimed at providing opportunities for underprivileged youth through sports and education.”\nSpoiler alert, there ain’t no such foundation. This is a much more sophisticated fraud than the thesaurus-wielding article spinner. But at its core, the threat from AI is the same as the threat from the article spinner—a future where misinformation drowns out reality. Both generate near infinite variations of the information they’re fed, excreting thousands upon thousands of words of novel-seeming prose that contains nothing new whatsoever. Both can satisfy any news outlet’s desire, along with advertisers, to fill up our eyeballs with seemingly fresh content. Both can generate enough “news” to fill up the biggest news hole on the planet a million times over. And both are essentially free. It’s tempting for any website seeking to convert audience attention into dollars. And that’s what makes modern media sites so vulnerable.\nNews outlets have experimented with publishing machine-generated work even before sophisticated machine-learning algorithms arrived. Yet none of that computer-generated news, even that created by the most cutting-edge AI, is truly new as much as it is a remix of information gathered by human beings—and human beings generally have the temerity to want to be paid for their work. Worse, human beings, expensive as they are, are the only way to tell the difference between true and false information.\nIt’s now easy—and cheap—to flood the Internet with information-free content that mimics real news. That means curation is increasingly vital to screening out nonsense. But as fakes become more sophisticated, that role becomes more difficult. All that leaves media outlets vulnerable to transmitting misinformation at viral speed. In other words, MSN faces the same dilemma that Facebook and ex-Twitter face: The moment you attempt to aggregate huge amounts of information without a good system of (human) curation capable of handling such large volume, you start becoming a vector for garbage.\nSeemingly in a losing battle, and an expensive one, news outlets may be tempted to save a few bucks by giving up entirely and choosing universal aggregation over careful curation. A few years ago, MSN began using algorithms rather than journalists to curate its homepage. But algorithms, even cutting-edge AI, won’t come to the rescue. Sure, ChatGPT is extremely sophisticated, but it can’t find fakes; it takes a good curator to detect that there is no such thing as the Brandon Hunter Foundation. One can check IRS publication 78, or look for Form-990 filings, or state charitable registrations, or corporate articles of organization—but there’s nothing there. A likely fake.\nThere is, however, one online reference to this foundation that might give any fact-checker pause. It comes from an obituary of Brandon Hunter on what appears to be a news site, Kanwasinews9: “His charitable sports went beyond the basketball floor. He set up the Brandon hunter foundation, a non-profit employer dedicated to improving the lives of deprived children thru sports, schooling, and training tasks,” it says. “Thru his foundation, he made a difference inside the lives of many kids by giving them the hazard to be successful and the direction they deserved to achieve this.”\nUseless.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nCharles Seife is director of the Arthur L.

{"title": "U.S. Heat Deaths Will Soar as the Climate Crisis Worsens", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nWith three degrees Celsius of warming, U.S. deaths during extreme temperatures could reach 63,000 a year, researchers calculate\nAs the climate crisis continues, the U.S. will see heat-related deaths multiply, according to research that scientists say is a sobering reminder of the importance of adapting to rising temperatures and reining in planet-warming pollution.\nAcross more than 100 U.S. cities, nearly 2,000 people died each year from exposure to extreme heat or cold between 1987 and 2000, the period over which data correlated to individual cities are available. By the 2010s the number of annual deaths was closer to 12,500. And when the global average temperature reaches three degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages—which scientists have said could occur around the end of the century, given current emissions reduction plans—the annual totals will be around 63,000 deaths related to extreme temperatures, according to research published last month in GeoHealth. Most of that growth comes from deaths in extreme heat.\nThe research is a direct response to a talking point by climate deniers that holds that because much of the U.S. has historically been more vulnerable to cold, a warming climate isn’t concerning, says study co-author Jangho Lee, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “Their argument was that since there are more cold-related deaths, compared to heat-related deaths, global warming will actually benefit human health,” he says. “We did not think that was true.”\nThat said, focusing on the balance between cold- and heat-related deaths might not be helpful because the latter are very likely undercounted, compared with cold-related mortality, says the University of Washington’s Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist who specializes in climate change and wasn’t involved in the new research. For one thing, she says, many hypothermia deaths “have to do with water, alcohol and boats,” not the temperature alone. In addition, Ebi says, when evaluating temperature-related deaths, scientists consider a three-week period for cold days versus just a three-day lag for hot ones. And in the U.S., extreme heat is already more deadly than hurricanes, floods and tornadoes combined.\nLee and his colleague Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, decided to run the numbers. They considered a trio of key factors that contribute to temperature-related deaths. First, the scientists noted that the U.S. population is expected to continue growing—so it’s no surprise that total temperature-related deaths will also grow. Additionally, they considered changing demographics, particularly the fact that the country’s population is aging, and both people with illnesses associated with aging, such as heart disease, and the elderly are at higher risk of dying from either cold or heat. Finally, the researchers considered adaptation by comparing cities’ current ability to manage extreme temperatures with what could happen if, for example, one that was more accustomed to helping people manage cold winters developed responses to better help them handle extreme heat.\nLee and Dessler’s findings suggest that, up through three degrees C of warming, increasing heat deaths and decreasing cold deaths will about balance out, with increases in total mortality driven by a growing and aging population. But with more than three degrees C of warming, they find, climate change will start pushing the number of deaths even higher.\nAdaptation could reduce the rise by about a quarter, however. “We were surprised by how much adaptation factors control the future temperature-related deaths, even more than climate itself,” Lee says. “So it is very important for us to adapt.” In cases of extreme heat, adaptation reduced annual deaths by nearly 10,000.\nBut the findings shouldn’t make people complacent about the prospect of less than three degrees C of warming, says Elisaveta Petkova, an environmental epidemiologist at Drew University, who wasn’t involved in the new research. “I don’t think we should feel completely reassured by the fact that most of those effects in the paper are projected to happen above three degrees Celsius change,” she says. “When you have rising temperatures, the weather becomes really, really unpredictable,” making it potentially more dangerous.\nThat means the study is yet another reminder of the importance of dramatically cutting carbon pollution before the planet reaches such exacerbated levels of warming.\nMoreover, Petkova says that the analysis’s emphasis on adaptation should inspire the U.S. to put more resolute focus on preparing for our climate future. “Adaptation is absolutely critical, and it requires consistent efforts,” she says. “The political climate in the United States has been a little unstable, and there hasn’t been a continuous vision about how adaptation should be approached.”\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist and news reporter for Scientific American who is based in New York City.\nTanya Lewis\nLucy Tu\nKatherine Harmon\nJessica E.

{"title": "The American Climate Corps Wants You", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nBiden’s new program is expected to hire 20,000 people in its first year for renewable energy projects and ecological restoration\nThe United States is about to embark on an experiment inspired by one of the New Deal’s most popular programs. On Wednesday, the Biden administration authorized the creation of the American Climate Corps through an executive order. The program would hire 20,000 young people in its first year, putting them to work installing wind and solar projects, making homes more energy-efficient, and restoring ecosystems like coastal wetlands to protect towns from flooding.\nThe idea has been in the works for years. It was first announced in President Joe Biden’s early days in the White House in January 2021, tucked into a single paragraph in an executive order on tackling the climate crisis. At the time, it was called the Civilian Climate Corps — a reference to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps, launched in 1933 to help the country survive the Great Depression, which was responsible for building hundreds of parks, including Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as many hiking trails and lodges you can find across the country today. Early versions of Biden’s trademark climate law that passed last year, the Inflation Reduction Act, included money for reviving the CCC. But that funding got cut during negotiations last summer with Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and the program was assumed dead. \nNow it’s back, with a name change. Biden’s executive order promises that the American Climate Corps “will ensure more young people have access to the skills-based training necessary for good-paying careers” in clean energy and climate resilience efforts. There are plans to link it with AmeriCorps, the national service program, and leverage several smaller climate corps initiatives that states have launched in California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, and Washington. However, the order didn’t provide details on what kind of funding the program is getting or how much workers will get paid. The White House also launched a new website where you can sign up to get updates about joining the program.\nReviving the Civilian Conservation Corps is widely popular, with 84 percent of Americans supporting the idea in polling conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication last year. Mark Paul, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University, said the new name that swapped “Civilian” for “American” leans into patriotism in an effort to broaden the program’s appeal even further. \n“I think that right now we are in a fight for the very soul of the nation,” Paul said. “President Biden and other Democrats are trying to brand climate [action] as not only good for the environment, but good for America. And I think that’s precisely what they are trying to convey with this name change, that climate jobs are good for the American people.”\nThe program could also be an attempt to appeal to young voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The administration drew criticism from climate activists when it approved the Willow oil project in northern Alaska in March after concluding that the courts wouldn’t allow them to block it. After that decision, polling from Data for Progress found that Biden’s approval ratings on climate change dropped 13 percent among voters between the ages of 18 to 29. The revival of the CCC has long been an item on progressives’ wish lists — back in 2020, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, reportedly sold Secretary of State John Kerry on making the program part of Biden’s platform during the 2020 presidential campaign. \n“I am thrilled to say that the White House has been responsive to our generation’s demand for a climate corps and that President Biden acknowledges that this is just the beginning of building the climate workforce of the future,” Varshini Prakash, the director of the youth-led Sunrise Movement, told reporters ahead of Biden’s announcement.\nTo be sure, the American Climate Corps could run into problems. If it’s modeled off AmeriCorps, the jobs might not exactly qualify as “good jobs” — AmeriCorps members are more like volunteers who get a small stipend, often living close to the poverty line. The White House, for its part, is selling the program as a path to good careers. The administration “will specifically be focused on making sure that folks that are coming through this program have a pathway into good-paying union jobs,” said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi on a call with reporters on Tuesday about the announcement. “We’re very keenly focused on that.” \nThe initiative could help bolster the ranks of workers like electricians, according to Zaidi, addressing the country’s shortage of skilled workers who can install low-carbon technologies like electric vehicle chargers and heat pumps. “We’re hopeful that the launch of the American Climate Corps will help accelerate training for a new generation of installers, contractors, and other tradespeople who are, at the end of the day, the ones who make these great ideas a reality,” Paul Lambert, co-founder and CEO of Quilt, a heat pump company in California, said in a statement to Grist.\nWith the goal of hiring 20,000 a year, the new program is much smaller than many activists had hoped: The original CCC employed 300,000 men in just its first three months (women were excluded until Eleanor Roosevelt’s “She-She-She” camps opened in 1934). Some progressives, like Ocasio-Cortez, were hoping a climate corps could employ 1.5 million people over five years. Assuming all goes well, the program could expand. Paul speculates that the Biden administration is starting small as “proof of concept to the American people to show that this program can work and that it is worthy of investment.”\nIf interest in the American Climate Corps is high, those 20,000 slots could fill up quickly. Among the 1,200 likely voters polled by Data for Progress two years ago, half of those under 45 said they’d consider joining, given the chance.\n“I teach youth day in and day out, and one of the biggest problems we face right now is youth feeling like they don’t know what to do,” Paul said. “And now we have a program that the U.S. government is facilitating to point to and say, ‘You know, if you want to help, here’s one way that you can contribute to decarbonizing our nation.’”\nThis story was originally published by Grist, a nonprofit media organization covering climate, justice, and solutions.\nKate Yoder is a staff writer for Grist.\n\nStephanie Roe | Opinion\nAndrea Thompson\nAndrea Thompson\nNick Pyenson and Alex Dehgan | Opinion\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Why Do Airplane Flights Cause Digestive Problems?", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nThe butterflies, and gas, in your tummy while you’re in flight might not just be from nerves\nIf you get an upset, gassy stomach while traveling on planes, you’re not alone.\nThe average person passes gas 12 to 25 times a day, but when you’re on a plane, you might feel like you’re constantly breaking wind. In addition to feeling gassy, some may experience an increase in other stomach issues during air travel. Though scientists have yet to directly measure digestive changes in people traveling on commercial passenger airlines, high-altitude research has revealed some clues to what’s happening in the gut when you’re in flight.\nAs you ascend to higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure decreases. This change in pressure makes the air feel thinner because there’s less oxygen. Low air pressure and cold temperatures at these elevations cause the air to expand, spreading out molecules such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon, all necessary components of air. When the blood doesn’t carry sufficient oxygen to tissues, it causes hypoxia, says Harvey Hamilton Allen, Jr., a gastroenterologist at Digestive Disease Medicine of Central New York. A reduced oxygen level in the body slows down the activity of digestive enzymes, which may contribute to problems with digestion. Research on hypoxia has also indicated several other gastrointestinal (GI) changes, from an upset stomach to more severe issues, such as bleeding in the bowels, Allen says.\nFortunately, traveling in a plane isn’t the same as climbing to the top of Mount Everest, which stands at a lofty height of 29,029 feet. Though commercial airplanes soar a bit higher at an altitude between 31,000 and 42,000 feet, they contain cabin-pressure-control systems in which conditioned air simulates a pressure akin to that at 8,000 feet of altitude.\nThat change in cabin pressure can still make gas in your gut expand if you have food in your stomach. Think of how your ears pop when the plane quickly ascends or descends, says Rudolph Bedford, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California. Like the middle ear, the gut has air-filled cavities that widen to adjust to the sudden shift in pressure.\n“Changes in cabin pressure and oxygen saturation, along with the vibration and motion of the plane, can inhibit gastric emptying,” Allen says. In other words, digested food can’t move to the small intestine, making it more difficult to do a number two. This can contribute to feeling bloated, gassy and nauseated.\nThe length of your flight matters as well. A one-hour flight won’t disrupt your gut as much as a 14-hour trip will. Spending most of your time sitting in a cramped seat can compress the abdomen and make it harder for food to pass through. Even if you maintain a good posture, sitting for long periods of time makes it harder for the expanded gas in the GI tract to escape. “Being less active slows down your intestinal motility, thereby exacerbating bloating and constipation,” says Sri Naveen Surapaneni, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Texas. Additionally, if you have heavy foods in your stomach, this could be problematic if the plane runs into any turbulence. Surapaneni says a bumpy ride could lead to nausea and vomiting for people prone to motion sickness.\nStress might also be a culprit in a gassy airborne stomach. Research has shown that the gut has a close relationship with the brain: people with flight anxiety release the stress hormone cortisol, which reduces blood flow and oxygen to the digestive system. The decreased blood flow, in turn, slows down the digestive system. “For many people with anxiety, getting on a plane and flying for long periods stimulates symptoms of bloating, cramping in their abdomen and the butterflies-in-their-stomach feeling,” Bedford says.\nIf you’re someone with a preexisting GI condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gastroenterologists warn that flying can worsen your symptoms. Bedford says people with Crohn’s disease, a type of IBD, may have episodes of diarrhea, while people with IBS, a noninflammatory condition that causes abdominal discomfort and altered bowel movements, report frequent bloating, diarrhea and constipation. The increase in symptoms, Bedford says, is not typically caused by the flight itself but by the anxiety of flying. Flight anxiety and underlying stress from delays or unexpected changes to travel plans may cause many people’s IBS to flare up, he says.\nThe good news is you can take steps to prevent tummy troubles on your next flight. Gut experts recommend drinking a lot of water. “When you’re traveling, you’re usually not drinking as much, so you’re becoming dehydrated,” Allen says. The dry air and low air pressure in long flights is dehydrating. “Dehydration due to low humidity levels in the cabin can slow down digestion and worsen constipation and preexisting IBS symptoms,” Surapaneni explains. Consider bringing a refillable water bottle with you on the plane.\nIf you are eating before your flight, opt for a light meal that’s gentle on the stomach. This includes lean proteins and foods rich in fiber and healthy fats, such as salmon and Greek yogurt with berries. “You don’t really want to have processed foods or salty foods before getting on a flight,” Bedford says. He also encourages people to not eat at least 30 minutes before the flight. Eating earlier can help your stomach digest the food before boarding.\nOnce on the plane, you’re better off skipping the wine, coffee or carbonated drinks, which might worsen an already upset stomach. Surapaneni also advises to stay mobile when it’s safe to do so, whether that’s by standing up to take a stretch or walking around the cabin.\nIf you have a GI condition or are nervous about an upcoming flight, it’s always a good idea to consult with your doctor before boarding in case there are other remedies they would recommend. Also, don’t fret if you continue feeling some digestive issues after landing. These symptoms are temporary and usually pass in 24 to 48 hours, Bedford says.\nSo the next time you’re on a plane, if you’re a little gassier than usual, Bedford says, it’s better to release it rather than attempt to hold it in for an entire flight. “Move around and let it rip—hopefully not sitting next to somebody, if you can avoid it,” he adds.\nJocelyn Solis-Moreira is a freelance journalist covering health and science.

{"title": "Last Meal of 465-Million-Year-Old Trilobite Discovered", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nScientists have uncovered an ancient trilobite’s last meal preserved inside a nearly intact fossil\nSome 465 million years ago, an armored pill-bug-like creature called a trilobite scuttled across an ancient seafloor and apparently scarfed up anything it could, according to a new analysis of its exceptionally preserved gut contents.\nThanks to their calcite-infused exoskeleton, trilobite fossils are routinely discovered around the world, revealing how these prehistoric seafarers saw their world and even how they had sex. But one major aspect of trilobites’ ecology that had long eluded researchers was their diet. Even the best-preserved trilobite fossils, which possess the ghostly imprint of a fossilized digestive tract, revealed frustratingly little about these critters’ menu.\nIn the new research, published this week in Nature, a team of scientists used cutting-edge imaging techniques to peer inside a well-preserved fossil of the species Bohemolichas incola. The researchers discovered the trilobite’s nearly intact gut—the first of its kind in the fossil record—stuffed with the shelly remnants of an ancient seafood feast, revealing that B. incola was not a picky eater.\n“This is the first example of actually being able to see what they were eating instead of just looking at the morphology and trying to infer what they could or couldn’t eat,” says Sarah Losso, a Harvard University invertebrate paleontologist, who wasn’t involved in the new study.\nThe trilobite specimen hails from a well-known fossil deposit near Prague. The area’s fossils, which are often preserved in three dimensions inside of nodules nicknamed Rockycany balls, offer a glimpse into a marine ecosystem that existed during the Middle Ordovician period between 470 million and 458 million years ago. When a local fossil hunter cracked into one of these nodules in 1908, they discovered the nearly intact trilobite entombed inside.\nThe stunning find ended up at a local museum, where paleontologist Petr Kraft came across the trilobite as a child and noticed something crammed inside it. Kraft, now a researcher at Charles University in Prague and lead author of the new study, spent decades wondering what was inside the trilobite. Until recently, however, he lacked a way to peer inside the fossil without destroying the specimen.\nTo determine a noninvasive approach, Kraft teamed up with Per Ahlberg, a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. They landed on synchrotron microtomography, an imaging technique that creates detailed three-dimensional scans of internal anatomy. This allowed the researchers to not only look through the trilobite’s shell but also differentiate the contents inside.\nThe 3-D scans revealed a bevy of shell fragments lodged in each of the trilobite’s two stomachs. The shells belonged to an assortment of tiny seafloor creatures, including small clams; bivalve crustaceans called ostracods; cone-shaped animals known as hyoliths; and stylophorans, oddly shaped precursors to starfish.\nThe varied spread of seafood in the trilobite’s guts led the scientists to conclude that B. incola was an opportunistic scavenger that trawled the seafloor for carcasses and anything slow enough for it to catch. “It seems to have been going along like a living version of one of those little automatic vacuum cleaners, [sucking up] small animals that could be swallowed whole or crushed up easily,” Ahlberg says.\nThe remains inside the trilobite’s stomachs largely aligned with what the scientists expected to find, but they were surprised by the ancient arthropod’s healthy appetite. “What is remarkable is just how stuffed full it is,” Ahlberg says. “It seems to have been really gorging itself, eating very rapidly.”\nThe team speculates that the trilobite may have been molting, which could explain the feeding frenzy. Like living crustaceans, trilobites shed their shell as they grew. According to Ahlberg, crabs will sometimes ingest water or large amounts of food to bulk up and crack their old shell. The team described a crack along the top of the trilobite’s shell that may indicate it was starting to molt when it was buried.\nAlso surprising: the shells in the trilobite’s guts showed little sign of the damage that usually occurs when calcium carbonate shells are soaked in stomach acid. This suggested that the trilobite likely had alkaline or neutral conditions in its gut, similar to the conditions found in the stomachs of living mud crabs and horseshoe crabs. Because these animals are only distantly related to trilobites, Ahlberg thinks that a neutral gut may be an ancestral condition across arthropods.\nThough the trilobite’s stomach may not have been particularly acidic, it still appears to have had a noxious gut. The researchers found areas in the fossil where scavengers had burrowed into the trilobite in search of soft tissue. The scavengers steered clear of the trilobite’s gut, however, revealing that bubbling enzymatic activity may have continued even after the animal died.\nLosso says the new findings add crucial ecological context to trilobites, which survived for a period of 270 million years and whose fossilized shells have been studied by researchers for centuries. “We’ve wanted this kind of fossil for hundreds of years, and they finally got it,” Losso says. “It just proves that you have to keep looking for more fossils.”\nJack Tamisiea is a science journalist based in Washington, D.C., who covers natural history and the environment.

{"title": "Pangaea Ultima, the Next Supercontinent, May Doom Mammals to Far-Future Extinction", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\n250 million years from now, the emergence of a new supercontinent could render most of Earth’s surface uninhabitable for mammals\nUp to 92% of Earth could be uninhabitable to mammals in 250 million years, researchers predict. The planet’s landmasses are expected to form a supercontinent, driving volcanism and increases to carbon dioxide levels that will leave most of its land barren.\n“It does seem like life is going to have a bit more of a hard time in the future,” says Hannah Davies, a geologist at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. “It’s a bit depressing.”\nEarth is currently thought to be in the middle of a supercontinent cycle as its present-day continents drift. The last supercontinent, Pangaea, broke apart about 200 million years ago. The next, dubbed Pangaea Ultima, is expected to form at the equator in about 250 million years, as the Atlantic Ocean shrinks and a merged Afro-Eurasian continent crashes into the Americas.\nModelling the climate of the new supercontinent, described on 25 September in Nature Geoscience, Alexander Farnsworth at the University of Bristol, UK, and his colleagues found that much of Pangaea Ultima will experience temperatures of higher than 40 °C, making it uninhabitable to most mammalian life. As they merge together and then drift apart, the continents will drive volcanic activity that “spews huge amounts of CO2 up into the atmosphere,” says Farnsworth, and that will heat up the planet.\nRegions in the middle of the supercontinent, far from the oceans, would turn into deserts that are unliveable “expect for very specialized mammals,” says Farnsworth. The lack of moisture would also diminish the amount of silica that is washed into the oceans, which usually removes CO2 from the atmosphere.\nIncreased solar radiation will cause further heating. The Sun is predicted to be 2.5% more luminous at the time of Pangaea Ultima’s formation, a result of the star having burnt more of its hydrogen fuel and shrunk its core, increasing its rate of nuclear fusion.\nIn a worst-case scenario, in which CO2 levels reach 1,120 parts per million, more than double current levels, just 8% of the planet’s surface — coastal and polar regions — would be habitable to most mammalian life, compared with about 66% today.\nThis would lead to a mass extinction, says Farnsworth. “It wouldn’t just be for mammals. It could be for plant life, as well, and other types of life. What comes out of it is anyone’s [guess]. In other mass extinctions a new species tends to dominate.”\nCarbon emissions caused by human activity were not considered by the researchers, who focused on long-term climate modelling.\nDavies, who has previously studied the formation of Pangaea Ultima, says that it is possible that some mammalian life might survive the environmental changes. “Whether or not they all go extinct is just one outcome, but it’s not the [only] outcome,” she says. It’s also not certain where Pangaea Ultima will form. Farnsworth’s modelling assumes it will coalesce in the warm tropics, but other scenarios suggest that it could form on top of the North Pole, leading to cooler conditions where life might fare better.\nThere is some evidence that Pangaea and other previous supercontinents had large interior deserts, says Davies, which decreased the area of habitable land and led to extinctions. “You see similar things happening in the end-Triassic extinction event” around 200 million years ago, she says.\nIf humans are still around in 250 million years, Farnsworth speculates that they might have found ways to adapt, with Earth resembling the 1965 science-fiction novel Dune. “Do humans become more specialist in desert environments, become more nocturnal, or keep in caves?” he asks. “I would suspect if we can get off this planet and find somewhere more habitable, that would be more preferable.”\nIt might not be all doom and gloom, however. “There have been extinction events in the past, and will be extinction events in the future,” says Davies. “I think life will make it through this one. It’s just kind of a grim period.”\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on September 25, 2023.\nJonathan O'Callaghan is an award-winning freelance journalist covering astronomy, astrophysics, commercial spaceflight and space exploration.

{"title": "Dead Trees and a Mysterious Cosmic Explosion Reveal Bigger Quake Risk for Seattle", "date": "", "text": "Save $10 on digital!\nSave $10 on digital!\nWashington State’s Puget Sound could face previously unknown earthquake risks, according to a new study that has pinned down the date of an ancient earthquake using tree rings and the radiation left by a mysterious cosmic force\nWashington State’s Puget Sound—home to the metropolises of Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia—is a sitting duck for a major earthquake, whether it comes in the form of a deep tremor triggered by a fragmenting tectonic plate, a shallow crustal fracture or an almighty megathrust on the boundary where one tectonic plate tumbles beneath another.\nAlthough nobody can say when the next significant quake will occur or precisely which of the region’s plentiful faults will be responsible, scientists can glean insights into contemporary seismic hazards by assembling a detailed record of the types and frequency of temblors that have rocked the region in the past few thousand years. But finding detailed evidence of major quakes prior to the dawn of modern seismology in the 20th century can be extremely difficult.\nNow, thanks to some clever scientific detective work, a catastrophic “hidden” quake has come to light. Using the natural clocks preserved within the carcasses of trees and aided by a mysterious cosmic explosion that showered Earth in radiation, researchers have fairly precisely pinned down a seismic event in the Puget Sound area to within a six-month period in the 10th century C.E. Their results, published on Wednesday in Science Advances, point to the possibility of multiple faults rupturing essentially simultaneously—a risk that is currently not planned for in the area. “It’s showing that these complex, large earthquakes are a real possibility,” says Bryan Black, a dendrochronologist at the University of Arizona and lead author of the new study.\nScientists know plenty of quakes have hit Puget Sound over the past few millennia. But the exact timing and manner of these ruptures is hazy. “Modern seismological instrumentation for global earthquake observations has only been around for a few decades, which is short, compared with the large earthquake cycles of hundreds to thousands of years,” says Zhe Jia, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who wasn’t involved with the new study. “As a result, our observations of earthquake complexities remain limited.”\nThat means “we have to use creative techniques to help us gather as many clues as we can about past earthquakes, because what happened in the past gives us constraints about what could happen in the future,” says Wendy Bohon, an independent earthquake geologist and science communicator, who also did not take part in the newly reported research.\nOne way to identify “missing” major quakes is to work out when trees were killed by seismic activity—directly by the shaking itself or indirectly by landslides, tsunamis or other quake-related mass movements. Radiocarbon dating of dead tree material in the Puget Sound region has suggested trees at multiple locations were killed by earthquakes around 1,100 years ago—give or take a few decades to a century or more. That uncertainty is not especially helpful for understanding a region’s seismic hazard potential. “Did these happen 100 years apart? That was a possibility. And that’s a much different seismic hazard than these happening within six months or less,” Black says.\nFortunately, the field of dendrochronology can come to the rescue. Tree trunks have growth rings; each concentric circle represents one year. Sample enough living trees in a region, and you can produce a tree-ring “barcode” that spans the hundreds or thousands of years various tree species can live. If you examine the tree-ring pattern on a dead tree that is preserved by mud and water, you can compare it with the living-tree-ring barcode and work out exactly what year the dead tree perished.\nThis technique has been previously used to determine the exact years of various cataclysms, ranging from volcanic explosions on the Greek island of Thíra (also called Santorini) to quake-generated tsunamis along the Pacific Northwest’s Cascadia subduction zone. Black’s team applied this forensic technique to dead preserved Douglas-fir-tree samples from multiple locations across Puget Sound, all associated with the area’s active Seattle and Saddle Mountain fault zones. “These were all underwater,” Black says. For example, one swath of trees in Seattle’s Lake Washington were submerged when an ancient, quake-induced landslide carried much of a forest down to the lake’s floor, drowning them.\nAn enigmatic radioactivity spike also helped the researchers. Between C.E. 774 and 775, trees all over the world recorded an uptick in radiogenic carbon 14 from an unknown but extremely energetic event in space—a potent solar flare or the violent outburst of a dying star or a black hole, perhaps—that sprinkled Earth in radiation. That created a very convenient and extremely well-defined time stamp that anchored those dendrochronological time lines and let the scientists determine that a quake, or quakes, slaughtered all these trees within a six-month period between the late fall of C.E. 923 to the early spring of C.E. 924. “I am in awe of the power this method shows to precisely date earthquakes for which we have no direct historic records,” says Harold Tobin, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, who wasn’t involved with the new study. “The result seems extraordinarily robust.”\nTurning to preexisting geophysical models that simulate the multitude of ways in which a studied fault can rupture, the researchers posit two versions of events that could have killed all those trees over that short time span: One scenario involves two distinct quakes—a magnitude 7.5 on the Seattle fault zone and a magnitude 7.3 on the Saddle Mountain fault zone—separated by a few hours to a few months. The other features a so-called compound earthquake, a single earthquake that happened nearly simultaneously across multiple faults in the region, with an estimated magnitude of 7.8.\nThat latter possibility in particular has experts concerned about how much they still have to learn about the seismic behavior of the area. “This would produce longer and stronger shaking over a wider area than is currently used in regional disaster planning,” Tobin says. The “one-two punch” of the individual but closely timed quakes is also worrying. “The first can cause damage, and thereby weakening, to both manmade structures and potential landslide slopes that would then fail in the second,” he adds.\nThe good news is that this is all coming to light before any such quakes have happened in the present. Emergency management plans can be tweaked accordingly, and communities can be better prepared for the days to come. Major quakes like these “are rare, fortunately,” Black says. “But they happen.”\nRobin George Andrews is a volcanologist, author and science writer based in London.
