The second match will run on Tuesday Jan. 16, the night after ESPN’s Monday Night Football NFL Wild Card game, giving both matches a football-driven promotional boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVince Vaughn Recalls 'Rudy' and 'Wedding Crashers' Roles During Spirited ESPN Appearance\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch WNBA Playoff Games Online Without Cable\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThere will be 15 regular season matches, plus semifinals and finals matches.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAll the matches will run on ESPN or ESPN2, and will also be simulcast on ESPN+. ABC will also air a TGL preview show on Saturday, Dec. 30. TMRW Sports and ESPN say that it is a “multi-year partnership.”\n\n\t“We think TGL is a well-aligned partner … from the time I was first connected with Mike I was impressed by their vision,” says Rosalyn Durant, executive vp of programming and acquisitions for ESPN, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “This is a fresh take on a familiar sport, you have the names, you have the foundation to draw all those existing fans, but then you have the innovation at the technology, the fan engagement to entice new fans.”\n\n\tMcCarley added that ESPN was “the ideal place and people to do this with.”\n\n\t“It’s going to fit with the rest of their programming and there’s going to be a natural tendency for the fans who are already there to watch this and, and keep coming back each week,” he added, noting that launching it after the NFL regular season was over and the end of college football season was a strategic decision. “You’ve got an opening from a national sports standpoint in kind of those early week windows… [for] most sports fans its too cold to go outside or they’re snowed in and providing them you know, a view and a sport that’s going to look a little bit different but it’s going to be familiar because of the players who are playing.”\n\n\tWoods, McIlroy and McCarley launched TMRW Sports last year, with TGL being their first project. Investors in TMRW Sports include former NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, executives like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin and Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, athletes like NBA star Steph Curry, F1 racer Lewis Hamilton and NFL quarterback Josh Allen, and entertainers like Justin Timberlake and Justin Bieber.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe company has since sold regional TGL teams to the likes of New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, who will own the New York team; Fenway Sports Group, which controls the Boston team; Arthur Blank, who owns the Atlanta team; and Alexis Ohanian and Serena and Venus Williams, who own the Los Angeles team. There will ultimately be six teams in the TGL.\n\n\tThe teams will consist of current PGA Tour players, with Woods, McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Matt Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Xander Schauffele, Max Homa, Rickie Fowler, and Billy Horschel all committed to participate. TGL said at the outset that it intended to work with existing PGA Tour partners as it pursued media deals.\n\n\tWoods, of course, is known for being ratings gold when it comes to live golf coverage.\n\n\t“Look at the partners he’s brought on board from Tiger and Rory, look at the investors that are connected to this business, look at the team owners there. It may be a new business concept, but these aren’t people new to business and new to the profession and to the sport of golf,” Durant said. “So we have we have full confidence in what they’re doing. We have full confidence in how it’s going to be presented. We have confidence in the names and the reach of audience that they’re going to bring on board.”\n\n\t“We’re confident that we’ll be able to bring their expertise in the game and the sport with our megaphone that is the ESPN brand, using our reach and the fandom that comes with ESPN to help bring in and expand their audience,” she adds.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe matches will take place at a newly-constructed high-tech venue, the SoFi Center in Palm Beach, Florida. Players will all be wearing microphones, with live fans in the arena to watch and cheer them on in the two-hour matches.\n\n\t“From a sports fan’s standpoint, this is like sitting courtside at an NBA game,” McCarley says. “And for the fan at home, it’s also that NBA courtside experience, it’s lights, it’s music, it’s player introductions. All the players will be miked up so that conversation, that kind of running conversation throughout the competition will be an important piece of it.”\n\n\tESPN already televises a number of golf events, televising the first two rounds of The Masters as well as the PGA Championship, and PGA Tour Live content on ESPN+.\n\n\tCAA’s merchant bank Evolution Media Capital (EMC) advised TMRW Sports on TGL’s domestic agreement with ESPN, and is also advising TGL on its international media rights distribution.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

The event supported the Rare Impact Fund’s mission to reduce the stigma associated with mental health and expand access to mental health services and education for young people around the world.\n\n\t“I’ve always wanted to do one but I thought we were too young to maybe do it,” Gomez, who launched the fund in 2020, told The Hollywood Reporter of throwing the benefit. “We’re in a good place and I guess why not now? We’re stoked to be able to do this, it’s going to a great cause and I just couldn’t be luckier.” \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNFL Defends Social Media Focus on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Amid Backlash\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTravis Kelce Says Coverage of Taylor Swift at His Games Is \"Overdoing It\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGomez’s Only Murders in the Building co-star Martin Short served as emcee for the evening, which also featured a special performance from H.E.R. and a DJ set by Marshmello. \n\n\tInside the event, Gomez took the stage and admitted the event was very overwhelming for her (“to be honest, I threw up this morning”), as she told the crowd, “This has been the culmination of a lifelong dream for me, but it has also stemmed from some of the darkest moments in my life.”\n\n\t“I struggled with the world inside my head for a long time and I felt lost and I felt hopeless at times. In 2020 I received my diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and to be honest, everything quickly changed. I actually got the knowledge and the answers I had been desperate for for so long, and understanding that obviously makes me become more aware of it, and I’m less afraid than I used to be,” she continued. “With that knowledge I could seek out the support I needed, to be myself, to find my joy again, and tonight I’m very proud to say that I have.  I’m working really hard every day and I’m so happy just to be alive and be here with you guys today.”\n\n\tGomez noted that if she, a person with resources, struggled for so long, what does that mean for those who don’t have access to the same support. The Rare Impact Fund has a goal of raising $100 million over the course of 10 years to provide those resources, which the star said “probably sounds really absurd, but I think it’s possible and I think I can do it. When I look at my little sister Gracie, the world that she and her generation inherits must be a better one — a kinder one, a clearer one, a more connected one, with support and access.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“It has been my ultimate dream to launch this fund and it’s probably the most important thing that I’ve ever done, and I just couldn’t be more proud of the Rare Impact team for the work that they’re doing,” Gomez said, finishing off her speech by thanking the crowd for “everything you’re going to do tonight; it’s the hardest journey I’ve ever been on but by far the most rewarding.”  \n\n\tFor his portion, Short unleashed a nonstop monologue of jokes, frequently teasing both Gomez and their missing third OMITB co-star Steve Martin. \n\n\t“I am proud to call Selena Gomez my friend, and not because she’s successful or rich; because she’s both,” Short teased at one point, before remarking seriously, “What makes tonight very important is we’re here to support youth mental health awareness. I don’t think there’s anyone in this room that hasn’t been touched by mental health and its issues and the pain it can bring a family. We are here to raise urgent funds for the young people who need them.”\n\n\tShort also led the evening’s auction, which included items like a glam session with Gomez’s stylists, a movie night with Paul Rudd, lunch with Camila Cabello and the biggest ticket item of the event, Taylor Swift concert tickets (which eventually sold for $15,000). \n\n\tGuests at the event also included Taylor Lautner, Tyga, Sofia Carson and longtime friend Francia Raisa, who spoke about the impact she’s seen Gomez have after being open with her own struggles.\n\n\t“She’s a brown woman and there’s such a stigma within Latinx households about mental health and seeking help, and she has such a big platform and such a big voice, so if this could help a little girl talk to her parent about mental health and they can hear that Selena Gomez is advocating for it, then it’s worth it,” Raisa said. “I want to be here and be a part of that as a first-generation American who also advocates for mental health.”  \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

And, in a surprise for those attending, Philadelphia Eagles‘ radio announcer Merrill Reese narrated a tribute reel shown before team Eagles mascot Swoop presented the Pioneer Award to Lomis’ widow, Patricia Laucella (the Philly born and raised Lomis was a diehard Eagles fan).\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChina Box Office: Zhang Yimou's 'Under the Light' Wins Mid-Autumn Holiday Race With $63M Opening\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBox Office: 'Paw Patrol' Sequel Scares Off 'Saw X' and 'The Creator' With $23M Opening\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Your instinct and inspiration never led you astray. I’m honored to have worked so closely with you,” said Creed series star and Creed III director Michael B. Jordan via video (the MGM threequel was the last film Lomis released in theaters before his death).\n\n\tThe long list of filmmakers, stars and studio executives paying tribute to Lomis throughout the evening also included director Paul Thomas Anderson — the duo worked closely together on the release of indie hit Licorice Pizza — and Chris Aronson, host of the evening and longtime Lomis colleague who now runs domestic distribution at Paramount. The event was sponsored by Amazon MGM Studios, where Lomis was working at the time of his death.\n\n\t“I was smitten with him, and our love affair began immediately. I could listen to his voice for hours,” Anderson said on stage when recalling first working together on The Master at The Weinstein Co. (Lomis never hesitated in standing up to Harvey Weinstein, a point alluded to repeatedly at Wednesday night’s dinner by those who know him best.)\n\n\tAnderson continued in describing Lomis: “I never met anyone who looked like a fucking booker or lineman whose language could make Richard Pryor blush,” says Anderson. “But it didn’t take me very long to realize he was just a big softie.”\n\n\t“He was an inspirational leader who had an impact wherever he went,” Aronson later told the crowd before announcing that Wednesday’s event raised $1,200,007.\n\n\tChristina Blumer, executive director of the Will Rogers Foundation, spearheaded the committee that decided to use this year’s event as a way of paying tribute to Lomis. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Pioneer Award, an annual tradition for more than seven decades, is one of the most prestigious tributes in the entertainment industry and within the philanthropic community. The proceeds from the charity dinner benefits the Pioneers Assistance Fund, which provides financial assistance to individuals in the motion picture distribution and exhibition community who are encountering an illness, injury or life-changing event.\n\n\tLomis was closely involved with the charity and was the host of last year’s show when Broccoli and Wilson received the Pioneer Award.\n\n\tPast Pioneer honorees include Tom Cruise, Donna Langley, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, Elizabeth Banks, Jim Gianopulos, Dick Cook, Michael D.

He told GQ last year that his agent said to him, “The Batman wants you to play the Joker — but you cannot tell anyone.”\n\n\tAs for how he embodied the character, Keoghan told the outlet that his Joker was created from his own experiences, both “a bit charming and a bit hurt.”\n\nA sequel, The Batman Part II, is currently in the works and is set to be released in 2025.

The joint statement and the continuation of negotiations will likely be read as a positive sign as the 2023 actors strike stretches on.\n\n\n\n\t“SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP met for a full day bargaining session and have concluded,” the statement read. “Negotiations will continue on Friday, October 6, with the parties working internally over the weekend, resuming Monday, October 9.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSAG-AFTRA Leader: Actors Should Get Same AI Protections As Studios\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLondon Film Festival Opens With 'Saltburn' Premiere as U.K. Crew Stages Protest Outside\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOn Monday, SAG-AFTRA restarted negotiations with the AMPTP for the first time since it went on strike in July. The parties changed up the venue — they met at the union’s national headquarters in Los Angeles, as opposed to the AMPTP’s offices in Sherman Oaks — and brought in some of the industry’s top leaders, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Disney CEO Bob Iger, and NBCUniversal Studio Group chairman and chief content officer Donna Langley. Both sides paused on Tuesday before continuing talks Wednesday.\n\n\tSAG-AFTRA’s national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, took a break from bargaining Wednesday to address the Federal Trade Commission about generative AI’s threat to creative industries — which is one of SAG-AFTRA’s top issues in its 2023 negotiations. \n\n\tIn the talk, Crabtree-Ireland argued that there was a “double standard” when it came to studios and entertainment companies using AI. “If an individual decided to infringe on one of these companies’ copyright-protected content, and distributed it without paying for the licensing rights, that individual would face a great deal of financial and legal ramifications,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “So why is the reverse not true? Shouldn’t the individuals whose intellectual property was used to train the AI algorithm at least be equally protected?”\n\n\tWith this round of negotiations, SAG-AFTRA is pushing to institute a “comprehensive set of provisions to protect human-created work and require informed consent and fair compensation when a ‘digital replica’ is made of a performer, or when their voice, likeness, or performance will be substantially changed using AI,” the union has said. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

But it also puts apps front and center, populating the home page depending on what services users subscribe to. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSky CEO Is \"Quite Optimistic\" on HBO Pact in U.K., Signals No Sale for Germany Unit With \"Potential\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn TV's Wild West, Which Channels Will Be Dropped Next?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFor Charter, which recently cut a deal to include Disney+ into its base pay TV tier, it is clearly a vision in which its live TV and streaming entertainment apps live side by side.\n\n\t“We want to still meaningfully participate in the video business,” said Rich DiGeronimo, president of product and technology for Charter, speaking at the event in midtown Manhattan. “Even as the industry is evolving at a rapid pace, and even though traditional linear viewership is in a state of decline, streaming viewership is significantly up and Charter wants to be able to participate in that growth.”\n\n\tIn fact, Charter’s recent deal to include Disney+ in some pay TV packages also made the presentation.\n\n\t“Spectrum is now including programmer direct-to-consumer apps within some of these packages,” DiGeronimo added, with a Disney+ tile conspicuously placed on the screen. “And we think that that’s really important to make it easy for customers to find the value of the package they get with Spectrum and to showcase those applications front and center as part of the package.”\n\n\tFor Comcast, the Xumo box will also be made available to internet subscribers, who can add whatever streaming apps they use. \n\n\tComcast and Charter announced the Xumo joint venture last year, combining the Xumo free streaming service, Comcast tech, and cash to create what is effectively a next-generation cable box, with a voice-activated UX, and a platform that automatically locates content accessible via the subscriptions users own, or live pay TV, where applicable.\n\n\t“Watching TV was designed to be a relaxing, lean-back experience, but today’s fractured entertainment landscape has added a level of complexity that makes finding something to watch more burdensome for consumers,” said Marcien Jenckes, president of Xumo. “When we started Xumo, we set out with the ambition to take the decades of entertainment experience and technical innovation from Comcast and Charter and build a complete entertainment experience that breaks down the streaming silos and makes TV easy again.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

{"title": "SAG-AFTRA Leader: Actors Should Get Same AI Protections As Studios", "date": "2023-10-04 23:54:16", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nAt a hearing before the Federal Trade Commission the same day the union was negotiating with the AMPTP, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland emphasized a \"double standard\" in the potential use of AI by companies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tWinston Cho\n\n\n\tConsent, credit and compensation.\n\n\tThose were the terms that SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and Writers Guild of America West negotiating committee member John August called for in order for guild members’ work, likenesses and brands to be used to train artificial intelligence systems. At a hearing before the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday, they joined other representatives for various groups — including authors, voice actors and musicians — to warn of the encroachment of generative AI into the media and entertainment industries that they say undercuts their labor and presents heightened risks of fraud.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSAG-AFTRA Negotiations to Continue Friday, Next Week\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLondon Film Festival Opens With 'Saltburn' Premiere as U.K. Crew Stages Protest Outside\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe rise of AI tools have concerned creators who’ve been urging policymakers to institute guardrails surrounding the use of the technology. In the absence of regulation, the WGA secured a deal with studios and streamers that provides some protection for members on how it can be credited and utilized. SAG-AFTRA has been pushing for similar terms in its negotiations.\n\n\tCrabtree-Ireland, who left the hearing early to return to negotiations with studios, said that human-generated content from actors, like in their likenesses, voices and performances, “reflects real and substantial work in its intellectual property” deserving of legal protection. He stressed a “double standard” in the potential use of AI by studios and other companies looking to deploy the technology.\n\n\t“If an individual decided to infringe on one of these companies’ copyright-protected content, and distributed it without paying for the licensing rights,” Crabtree-Ireland said, “that individual would face a great deal of financial and legal ramifications.”\n\n\tHe added, “So why is the reverse not true? Shouldn’t the individuals whose intellectual property was used to train the AI algorithm at least be equally protected?”\n\n\tCopyright doesn’t account for actors faces or singers voices, but there are laws in some states — like California, New York and Florida — that protect against unauthorized commercial use of a person’s name, likeness and persona, among other things. It’s meant to provide people the exclusive right to profit off of their identities. Music publishers are currently pushing for a federal right of publicity law to combat voice mimicry in AI tracks that would likely also help actors and other creators.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAs part of their tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, writers ensured that the use of generative AI tools won’t affect their credit or compensation and must be disclosed by studios. August, pointing to those provisions of the agreement, likened scribes and other artists to small business, “each competing in the marketplace to sell their work.” To succeed, writers develop unique styles and brands that are essentially being stolen by AI companies indiscriminately scraping the Internet for material to train AI systems, he explained.\n\n\t“This is theft, not fair use,” August said, referring to the legal concept that copyrighted works can be used to make new creations as long as they are transformative. “Our work, protected by copyright and our own contractual rights, are being used entirely without our authorization, without any attribution, or compensation.”\n\n\tFor writers and authors, the issue isn’t just about the copying of their scripts or books that are then fed into so-called large language models that power the human-mimicking AI bots that can produce pitches and loglines in a matter of seconds. It’s also about AI companies profiting off of their work by creating infringing material, which the FTC has signaled could rise to an unfair method of competition. August said that bad actors are “using stolen goods to undercut the prices of a seller,” like in AI-generated knockoffs of popular novels that are being sold on Amazon.\n\n\tThis remains a point of contention for writers, he continued, because the WGA deal only covers their work for studios, while “most of the real work on AI is being done by companies like Google, Facebook and OpenAI,” which have no contractual relationship with the guild. August emphasized, “Public policy will play a crucial role in protecting our members.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAt the hearing, much of concerns raised by the WGA were echoed by Authors Guild policy director Umair Kazi. He focused most of his remarks on the use of members’ works as training data for AI companies, which are fueling the production of competing derivative works.\n\n\t“It is inherently unfair to use copyrighted works to create highly profitable tech, which is also able to produce competing derivative works without the creators consent, compensation or credit,” Kazi said. “There’s a serious risk of market dilution from machine generated books and other works that can be cheaply mass produced, and shall inevitably lower the economic and artistic value of human created works.”\n\n\tFor example, generative AI is already being used to impersonate popular authors to create low-quality ebooks. Kazi detailed, “Earlier this year, AI-generated books started dominating Amazon’s best-seller list in the young adult romance category.”\n\n\tLast month, the Authors Guild — led by prominent authors including George R.R. Martin, Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham — stepped into the legal battle against OpenAI. The group, with more than 13,000 members in its ranks, represents what is likely the most formidable opponent suing the company in a case that could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and an order requiring it to destroy systems trained on copyrighted works.\n\n\tA potential licensing market is a critical component of whether AI companies will be able to avail themselves of a fair-use defense in lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement. AI companies will likely run into the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts v. Goldsmith, which effectively reined in the scope of fair use. In that case, the majority stressed that an analysis of whether an allegedly infringing work was sufficiently transformed must be balanced against the “commercial nature of the use.” If authors are able to establish that OpenAI’s scraping of their novels undercut their economic prospects to profit off of their works by, for example, interfering with potential licensing deals that the company could have instead pursued, then fair use is likely not to be found, according to legal experts consulted by THR.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAn opt-in system should be mandatory under any potential licensing regime, said August. This means that creators wouldn’t be forced to opt out for their work to be excluded from training data.\n\n\tMultiple speakers also alerted the FTC on the rise of fraud using AI tools. Tim Friedlander, president of the National Association of Voice Actors, pointed to deepfake ads featuring Tom Hanks and MrBeast. “Currently it only takes three seconds of source audio to create a realistic voice clone, and synthetic content can be used to deceive consumers into believing that trusted voices are communicating with them,” he said.\n\n\tJust this week, Hanks and MrBeast took to social media to warn fans that businesses pilfered their likenesses without consent to create AI versions of themselves for commercial purposes.\n\n\tIn one of the more disturbing allegations, Sara Ziff, founder of the Model Alliance, said that modeling agencies are using AI deepfakes rather than hiring real models to meet diversity goals.\n\n\t“A digital model who was created through AI in 2017 by the world’s first all digital modeling agency has appeared as a base of high-end brands, such as BMW and Louis Vuitton,” said Ziff, who noted that Levi also announced this year that it’s using AI-generated models to increase the appearance of diversity. “Critics have called this a form of digital blackface.”\n\n\tThe scope of potentially fraudulent business practices the FTC is concerned about also includes actions that some companies may be deploying to undermine labor. Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya pointed to studios cornering background actors into scanning their likenesses for future use.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nUnique expertise on how the law impacts Hollywood pros, projects and processes\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

But it’s very surprising how few of television’s biggest platforms have even attempted to reproduce that success. There has probably been a visible uptick in available Korean programming in the States but — perhaps in tacit recognition of the fact that Squid Game became Squid Game because of its stealthy word-of-mouth explosion — there hasn’t been an evident rise in shows getting a big promotional push in the hopes of becoming the NEXT Squid Game.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'iCarly' Sequel Canceled at Paramount+\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParamount+ Names Anna Priest U.K. Head, Pluto TV Gets Senior VP, Int'l Content Programming, Acquisitions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIf nothing else, Paramount+ is giving a push to the new six-part drama Bargain, from writer-director Jeon Woo-sung. It’s frequently easy to see why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBargain\t\t\n\t\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\t\n\tA taut one-shot wonder.\n\t\n\n\n\nAirdate: Thursday, October 5Cast: Jin Sun-Kyu, Jun Jong-Seo, Chang RyulCreator/Director: Jeon Woo-Sung\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirdate: Thursday, October 5Cast: Jin Sun-Kyu, Jun Jong-Seo, Chang RyulCreator/Director: Jeon Woo-Sung\n\nBargain is not, of course, the next Squid Game. Nothing is. Or when something is, it will probably emerge out of nowhere.\n\n\tBut it isn’t a wholly inappropriate comparison, especially in thematic terms: Like Squid Game, Bargain uses an elaborate genre exercise for a class critique in which the elite are literally and figuratively preying on the economically disadvantaged. Bargain might be a hair less cynical than Squid Game, but in its often metaphorical evisceration of a commodity culture that itemizes and monetizes the poor, right down to biological minutiae, it’s pretty damn cynical.\n\n\tAnd, as was the case with Squid Game, it will be easy for anybody who wants to ignore the series’ message — see Netflix’s soulless decision to make a “reality” version of Squid Game — to concentrate on the formal elements in Bargain, because Jeon Woo-sung’s direction is attention-grabbing, format-challenging and, at its best, pretty remarkable.\n\n\tIt happens that in between the provocative themes and showy direction, Bargain has a story and characters that are stretched absurdly thin. But with the breathless episodes clocking in at between 35 and 37 minutes, you can avoid focusing on those flaws as much as you choose to.\n\nBargain begins with Park Joo-Young (Jeon Jong-Seo) staring listlessly out the window of a comfortable but remote hotel. All she can see in the distance are mountains and a reservoir. She’s awaiting Noh Hyung-soo (Jin Sun-kyu), who has reached an agreement to take Joo-Young’s virginity for the agreed-upon price of $1,000 (per the sometimes spotty subtitles). Hyung-soo likes what he sees and expresses pleasure that in a world in which nothing is as advertised, Joo Young looks like her picture. But he doubts her virginity and demands to see blood. Ew.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThen he tries bargaining down her price, one of several ways in which the title of the show is literal. Hyung-soo is gross. The whole situation is gross. But don’t worry. It gets worse!\n\n\tSee, despite her schoolgirl uniform and exaggerated giggle, Joo-Young is not, in fact, an 18-year-old high-school junior. She’s an operator in an organ trafficking ring, and Hyung-soo — also not who he claims to be — is soon strapped to a gurney and subjected to an auction, selling off his bits and pieces to the highest bidders. Hyung-soo’s first kidney has just gone for well over $100,000 to Geuk-ryul (Chang Ryul), a dutiful son whose father keeps getting usurped on the transplant list by wealthier patients, when the hotel is rocked by an earthquake and then a landslide.\n\n\tHyung-soo, Joo-Young and occasionally Geuk-ryul (who everybody mostly calls “The Good Son”) spend the next 2.5 hours trying to escape from the collapsed ruins of the hotel, where they’re going to discover that people whose morality allows them to buy and sell the organs of unwitting victims are also willing to do anything to survive. Throw in the prospect of stealing millions from the crumbling enterprise’s coffers and the stakes and body count only rise.\n\n\tIt’s here that I should mention the conceit, or possibly gimmick, behind Woo-Sung’s adaptation of what was apparently a 2015 South Korean short film: Each episode of Bargain is designed to look like a single, continuous shot and, if you were to remove the title sequences and episodic title cards, one could process the show as a continuous three-hour shot — up until some cheating in the lackluster final minutes, designed to set up a second season.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNow at this point, smart viewers have been trained to recognize masked cuts. Bargain is full of them, some very, very obvious — when the camera follows characters plunging from a high floor of the hotel through a perfectly symmetrical hole that goes from rooftop to cellar, it is not, in fact, an uninterrupted practical shot — and some capitalizing on a chaotic environment in which flickering lights, pockets of darkness and plumes of debris offer distractions and technical feints.\n\n\tOccasionally there’s a “How the heck did he do that?” quality to Woo-sung’s direction and the cinematography by Young-Ho Kim. I was more frequently just enjoying the cohesive claustrophobic effect that comes from the technique, as the characters start on the hotel’s fifth floor, make their way to the basement where a pair of laborers dispose of the hollowed-out bodies, and then move back up through the hotel in search of escape.\n\n\tThe hotel is, as I already said, a metaphor, as is generally the case in the building-escape subgenre. From The Towering Inferno to The Raid to Dredd, stories like this use their settings as embodiments of a hierarchy in which the rich are perched precariously at the top, doing anything in their ample power to ignore and then repress the strivers at the bottom.\n\n\tIt’s also an easily segmented environment that lends itself to episodic storytelling. The installment in the cellar — home to a fish-filled pool, gnarly corpse-dismemberment tools and dingy, chipped tiling on the walls and floors — is like something out of a Saw movie, with the director staging torture and an escape attempt in the most dazzling of the show’s one-shot feats. One later episode includes action in a very cramped hotel room; another becomes something out of Reservoir Dogs, with lots of high-intensity shouting and, well, bargaining as characters try to figure out who they can trust and what they’ll have to do in order to survive. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe series’ production design is, by necessity, a malleable marvel, full of twisty hallways and strategically placed crevasses and chasms for characters to navigate or spot approaching terrors through. Just because few of the endless shots are actually longer than five or 10 minutes without a cut doesn’t mean that there isn’t a ton of very intricate choreography at play.\n\n\tI mentioned characters a couple of times there, and I probably should have put “characters” in quotation marks. Bargain is mostly Hyung-Soo and Joo-Young bickering and ascending, with occasional appearances by the Good Son, who shows up exclusively to demand that Hyung-Soo live up to his responsibilities, organ-wise, however involuntary that donation was. He’s there for a strange sort of earnest comedy as well as part of a running joke in which all of these people, victims of circumstance, demand that other people take responsibility for things — medical equity, infrastructure improvements, decency — that ideally should be the mandate of state and religious institutions. Chang provides one sort of dark laughs and Jin provides both high drama and a broader sort of comedy, since his character is stuck dealing with the apocalypse in red boxer-briefs and shiny galoshes for much of the series. It’s left to Jun to play the most fully realized character in a show in which hardly anybody else even has a name, making Joo-Young both victim and capable perpetrator depending on the moment.\n\n\tDon’t spend much time trying to ponder the realism of the interactions between any of the main characters. Don’t spend much time contemplating the practical geography of the hotel. And definitely don’t spend much time trying to make sense of the business plan governing this prostitution/trafficking ring. This is not a show that thrives on common sense or nuance, which caused some diminishing of my interest as the series charged toward a conclusion that felt perfunctory more than cumulative.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tStill, as an intense piece of directorial ingenuity and a pitch-black satire of the dehumanized state of contemporary culture, Bargain is fully worthy of what ought to be initial curiosity and then burgeoning buzz.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for Now See This for recommendations on what to watch and why from THR’s chief TV critic\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
