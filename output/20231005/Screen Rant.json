{"title": "Wheel Of Time: Why The Season 1 Finale Faked Loial's Death", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:34", "text": "Wheel of Time made a surprising choice in the season 1 finale when it pretended to kill off Loial. Here's why that moment was included.\nAmazon’s The Wheel of Time show made a surprising choice when it faked Loial’s death in the season 1 finale, but how did Loial survive? During the episode, the fan-favorite Ogier from Robert Jordan’s novels was seemingly murdered by Padan Fain in a gruesome scene. However, it’s now known that Loial hasn’t been removed from the series after all. Loial’s apparent demise sparked shock from the fans, especially since the character is such an important part of Jordan’s Wheel of Time story. Not only that, but his early “death” felt rather pointless, given that he had hardly been around long for it to matter.\nSince he barely knew Rand and the others, the emotional impact of his death on The Wheel of Time characters in season 2 would have been severely limited. The confusion caused by this decision was cleared up after the finale’s release when Wheel of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins addressed the incident. Though the episode provided no hints that Loial survived the stab wounds he sustained in his encounter with Padan Fain, Judkins confirmed that the character was in fact alive. So, this brings up the question of how did Loial survive.\nIn the season 1 finale, Padan Fain (Johann Myers) appeared to deliver the fatal stab wound to Loial, killing the fan-favorite character. However, shortly after this happened, Wheel of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins confirmed the Ogier didn't actually die. Wheel of Time faking Loial's death in the finale and then confirming his survival immediately afterward was an odd creative choice, but not one that was done without a reason. Judkins’ comments on the matter have shed light on why this moment was included.\nAccording to the showrunner, he wanted to use its Loial fakeout to get fans ready for real character deaths. He explained that while he didn’t truly kill off Loial, some book characters will eventually have to die (even if they live in the source material). His thinking was that if viewers thought Loial was dead (albeit only briefly), they would be “emotionally prepared” for that inevitable scenario [via EW].\n\"I wanted people to be a little on their toes, because real deaths are coming for characters that don't die in the books. We have to, because we can't hold 2,000 series regulars through multiple seasons. It's coming, and I want people to emotionally prepare themselves. The thought that Loial might be gone will hopefully start to get people emotionally prepared, but I couldn't. He's my favorite.\"\nThis reasoning makes sense, especially when considering the size of the series’ cast and how long most of the characters stick around. As the Wheel of Time book series went on, Jordan continuously built on to its cast with new characters and expanded the roles of minor ones. Rarely did the books ever kill off or altogether remove a key character. Instead, dozens of Wheel of Time characters popped in and out and lingered on throughout the series. This was true for not only the biggest players in the story, but also recurring allies such as Juilin Sandar, Galad Damodred, Leanne Sharif, Alanna Mosvani, and Logain Ablar.\nAs Judkins has pointed out, the show just “can't hold 2,000 series regulars through multiple seasons.” A few Wheel of Time characters will have to be written out, which is a book change that Judkins has promised will happen at some point or another. And since keeping every main character around just isn’t a sustainable model for a TV show, it’s understandable that some favorites will eventually meet untimely ends before The Wheel of Time ends. But whether faking out Loial’s death has succeeded in preparing audiences for these unexpected deaths remains to be seen.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows of All Time\nSadly, Wheel of Time never bothered to even explain how Loial survived the apparent death in the first season. In that season 1 finale, Padan stabbed Loial in the chest and it looked like that was enough to kill him. However, when Loial showed back up in season 2, he looked just fine, as if nothing happened. He doesn't even mention getting stabbed in the chest in the first season, and he just shops up looking happy and fit, as he did before this seemingly life-threatening incident. There was a six-month time jump before he showed back up in Wheel of Time, but it seems strange to think that the show has just ignored his near death.\n\n"}
{"title": "Masters Of The Air Release Date & Images: First New WW2 Miniseries From Band Of Brothers Team In 13 Years", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Masters of the Air, a new World War II miniseries from the team behind Band of Brothers, has received a release date, alongside images from the show.\nMasters of the Air, a new World War II miniseries developed by the team behind Band of Brothers, has been given a release date, alongside images offering a first look at the show. The upcoming Apple TV+ series will see the Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman reunite to produce another World War II series. The trio previously collaborated for 2001's Band of Brothers and its 2010 companion series, The Pacific.\nNow, Apple TV+ has revealed that Masters of the Air will be premiering on the streaming platform beginning Friday, January 26, 2024. The series will begin with two episodes before airing one new episode every week, ending on March 15. In addition, the first images from the series were released, which can be viewed below:\nProducer Goetzman also released a statement about what to expect from the series, which can be read below:\n'Masters of the Air' is a salute to the brave men of the 8th Air Force, who, through their courage and brotherhood, helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II. Tom [Hanks] and Steven [Spielberg] have always wanted to visualize cinematically what our author Don Miller has called, this ‘singular event in the history of warfare.’ We’re thrilled that Apple TV+ has given us the opportunity to combine the efforts of so many talented people, on-screen and behind the camera, to tell this important story.\nMasters of the Air is based on Donald L. Miller's book of the same name, documenting the real-life actions of the US Air Force's 100th Bombardment Group - also known as the Bloody Hundredth. As Goetzman indicated, the miniseries will follow the real-life events the 8th Air Force was involved in during World War II. The miniseries will recount the history of the Bloody Hundredth in the form of a war drama.\nThe cast for Masters of the Air underscores how emotionally potent the performances in the series will be. Major cast members include Austin Butler (Elvis), Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin), Callum Turner (Queen and Country), Anthony Boyle (Tetris), and Sam Hazeldine (Slow Horses). However, the ensemble cast of the show will feature dozens of actors portraying the many young men that were part of the Bloody Hundredth.\nWhile Masters of the Air has broken a Band of Brothers tradition by airing on Apple TV+ instead of HBO, Spielberg, Hanks, and Goetzman's involvement indicates the series will be just as memorable. With plenty of talented actors taking on the roles of World War II Air Force soldiers, the series is promising an emotional retelling of the Bloody Hundredth's history. The extent of the series' intensity will be revealed once it premieres next year.\nSource: Apple TV+\n"}
{"title": "Ahsoka's Replacement For Her Broken Lightsaber Was Set Up By Star Wars 5 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Ahsoka Tano may have lost her shorter shoto-style lightsaber in the Ahsoka finale, but Star Wars Rebels already set up its eventual replacement.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nAhsoka Tano may have lost one of her lightsabers in the Ahsoka finale, but Star Wars has already set up its replacement. The Ahsoka finale saw one of the show’s toughest lightsaber duels yet. In a last-ditch attempt to stop Grand Admiral Thrawn from returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy, Ahsoka, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger stormed the Nightsisters’ fortress on Peridea. There, they encountered many obstacles, including a new-and-improved version of Morgan Elsbeth. As a reward for all of Morgan’s efforts in the race to get home, the Great Mothers bestowed a gift upon her, including an additional helping of dark magick, as well as a powerful sword known as the Blade of Talzin.\nReprising their fight from The Mandalorian season 2, Ahsoka and Morgan went head-to-head in a duel that proved to be one of Ahsoka’s most exciting yet. What made it so thrilling is that it's clear that even for someone as skilled as Ahsoka, Morgan was not an enemy easily overcome. Morgan even managed to destroy one of Ahsoka’s two lightsaber hilts – the shorter, shoto-style one – by cutting it in half, forcing Ahsoka to fight with just one lightsaber. Yet, despite Morgan’s best efforts, Ahsoka prevails and kills her adversary – but what will she do now after losing one of her weapons?\nThough the Ahsoka finale makes it clear that Ahsoka could potentially rebuild her lost lightsaber with all the equipment that Huyang has stored aboard their ship – Ezra manages to quickly construct a brand-new lightsaber, too – there’s a chance she may decide not to. In the now partially retconned Star Wars Rebels epilogue, Ahsoka meets Sabine on Lothal in a resplendent white robe while carrying a simple, yet elegant white staff. The Ahsoka show has canonically depicted Ahsoka’s transformation into Ahsoka the White after her ordeal in the World Between Worlds, but the staff has yet to make an appearance. Now that one of Ahsoka’s lightsabers has been destroyed and she and Sabine are stranded on Peridea, she may end up creating that new staff after all, using it as a replacement for her second lightsaber.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nAhsoka has changed as a result of her journey in the Ahsoka show. In the World Between Worlds, she chose life, reconciled with her past, and embraced her future. Stranded on Peridea, a place with a deep and mysterious connection to the Force – as demonstrated by the Great Mothers’ powers, the statues of the Mortis gods, and the appearance of the owl-like creature, a convor known as Morai – Ahsoka may yet change even more. It’s possible that, by connecting to the Force in a new way on Peridea, Ahsoka may decide to become something beyond being a Ronin or a Jedi. She may choose to forego her lightsabers altogether, fully embracing the Force as her closest ally.\nRELATED: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nIn the Star Wars Rebels epilogue, there’s nothing to suggest that Ahsoka still carries her lightsabers with her. Her transformation into Ahsoka the White is meant to symbolize her new-found wisdom, strength, authority, and compassion, mirroring Gandalf’s journey in The Lord of the Rings. To be a leader, and to protect the galaxy, Ahsoka doesn’t necessarily need her lightsabers. Those are weapons used for close combat, and Ahsoka could be more and mean more. Ahsoka’s transformation was foreshadowed when the Daughter – essentially a living conduit for the light side of the Force – gave her life so that Ahsoka may live in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Now, after the Ahsoka finale, Ahsoka has all the tools she needs to become who she was always meant to be.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's Main Character Powers Have 1 Big Thing In Common (That The Boys & The Seven Don't)", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Gen V may be a spinoff of Amazon Prime Video’s superhero series The Boys, but this new show has something that its predecessors did not.\nWarning: This article contains mentions of self-harm, eating disorders, drug abuse, and suicide.\nThe latest installment in The Boys franchise, Gen V, is already proving that it isn't like its predecessors by creating a major connection between its main characters' powers. Gen V is the third series in The Boys franchise, which is based on a series of comics of the same name, written by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. While The Boys explores the corruption of the world's top superheroes and the vigilante group intent on taking them down, Gen V focuses on a group of young supes training at the Vought-run Godolkin University.\nThough Gen V is firmly rooted in The Boys timeline, the series is already much different than those that came before it. The show has an entirely new cast with completely new priorities and aims. However, one especially significant difference between The Boys and Gen V is the connections between the series' supes. While The Boys introduced a set of heroes that were all unique from each other, the characters in Gen V all have one thing in common that links their powers together. This commonality has never been seen before in The Boys or The Seven, which means Gen V could exemplify how the franchise is evolving.\nRelated: Gen V Season 2: Renewal Chances, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nWhat makes Gen V stand out is the fact that all the main characters' powers stem from their mental health conditions. While these supes are powerful, their abilities are all inextricably linked to the personal problems they are facing. This often leaves the characters feeling drained or hurt after using their powers. The connections are as follows: Marie must self-harm to use her blood magic, Emma purges and binges food to shrink or grow, Jordan's powers parallel the identity struggles of a transgender individual, Luke's powers lead him to take his own life, and Cate's abilities are referred to as \"pushing,\" a term often used in relation to drug abuse.\nOne character that doesn't quite fit the mold of this theory is Andre. Andre Anderson is a popular kid at Godolkin University with powers of magnetic manipulation. In his personal life, he is under intense pressure to succeed due to his father's incredible reputation and power. Though it is a stretch, Andre's powers could correlate to his need to charm others, thereby pulling them toward him. His magnetism could also feel like a sort of physical pressure that aligns with the mental one he faces. Either way, Andre's connection to this theory still has time to make itself known later in the series.\nOverall, Gen V's power connection is a hint at what the series is really aiming to say. While The Boys is a superhero and action series through and through, Gen V seems to be less about the superhero side of things, and more about the struggles young people face within the setting of a superhero world. The focus is not necessarily on what these characters can do, but how they do them, and what the cost is to their personhood. This is a topic that is not as prevalent in The Boys, and so is a great area for Gen V to explore, especially through the lens of a younger cast.\nAnother aspect of Gen V that fits with this idea is the dean of Godolkin University. Indira Shetty is the dean of Godolkin, but she isn't a superhero at all. She is actually a behavorial therapist. This fact makes her all the more important when considering the problems each main character is dealing with. These characters don't need help with their powers, but with their mental health conditions, and ironically, Shetty is more equipped to handle such issues. Overall, Gen V seems to be setting up a situation in which these young supes have to handle their personal problems before they can become true heroes.\nThe fact that Gen V's characters are connected via their mental health conditions and related powers makes the series stand out from The Boys. The series' focus on mental health makes the tone entirely different to The Boys, which leans much more into violence and chaos. Overall, these differences are good because they set the shows apart from each other and prove that the franchise can be dynamic. Gen V may be a spinoff of The Boys, but it doesn't have to be a carbon copy, and in fact, its differences are what make it better.\n"}
{"title": "Strange New Worlds Season 3 Should Go Gangster Like TOS & TNG", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds should follow in the footsteps of TOS and TNG, and let its characters take on the gangster genre.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds should take on the gangster genre, following in the footsteps of Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Both previous Trek series made excellent use of the gangster genre in the classic episodes TOS season 2, episode 17, \"A Piece of the Action\" and TNG season 1, episode 12, \"The Big Goodbye.\" \"A Piece of the Action\" sees Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) visit a planet with a culture based on 1920s-era Chicago. Kirk and Spock dress the part as mobsters and have fun interacting with the eccentric locals.\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation's \"The Big Goodbye,\" Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) takes on the persona of fictional hard-boiled detective Dixon Hill in the first Star Trek holodeck episode. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) also get in on the fun, dressing in period wear and embracing the fictional story they find themselves in. The characters of Strange New Worlds have had their fair share of wacky adventures, and they would have a blast taking on a story of mobsters and murder mysteries.\nRelated: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Cast - Every New & Returning Character In Season 2\nWith the gangster episodes of TOS and TNG, Star Trek proved that it can do that particular genre really well. Not only does the concept give the actors a chance to wear fun period costumes, but it also allows them to portray a different version of their characters. Gangster or hard-boiled detective stories may not seem to have a lot in common with Star Trek, but something about the combination really works. The detective genre is an easy genre to reference, with plenty of recognizable tropes and cliches. It would be so much fun to see Anson Mount's Captain Christopher Pike and the rest of the crew of his Enterprise dress up in period costumes and embrace their inner mobster.\nAlthough the Enterprise of Strange New Worlds does not have a holodeck, there are many ways they could justify a mobster storyline. The most obvious solution would be for Captain Pike and the Enterprise to visit Sigma Iotia II, the same planet Captain Kirk and Spock visit in \"A Piece of the Action.\" When the Federation made first contact with Sigma Iotia II 100 years before Kirk visited there, they left behind a book entitled Chicago Mobs of the Twenties. The inhabitants of the planet then formed their entire society based on this book. With a behind-the-scenes team as creative as those behind Strange New Worlds, they could undoubtedly come up with a fun and interesting way to incorporate a mobster story into the show.\nOver the course of its two seasons so far, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has done a fairytale-inspired episode, a space pirates episode, an alternate future episode, two comedy episodes, a courtroom episode, a time travel episode, an amnesia episode, a crossover episode, and Star Trek's first ever musical episode. That is a lot of different genres to cover in 20 episodes, and yet, Strange New Worlds has done a wonderful job of making all of these premises work. The main reason these episodes work so well comes down largely to the incredible cast.\nOf course, the writing has to be solid for these various stories to work, and it undoubtedly has been. But the actors take the writing to another level with their performances, never failing to put their whole heart into every outlandish premise. The writers and actors of Strange New Worlds understand the characters well, and even the most gimmicky episodes move the plot forward and offer insight into the characters. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has proven that it can do many different genres well, and the wonderful cast should get the chance to go full gangster like the casts of TOS and TNG before them.\n"}

Following that, Cliff will either bring out Water- and Psychic-type Slowking, Psychic- and Flying-type Gallade, or Rock- and Grass-type Cradily.

Gengar, on the other hand is a Ghost- and Poison-type, which counters Slowking, Gallade, and Dusknoir.\nWhile battling Leader Cliff with this setup is somewhat a matter of getting the right matchups, when the stars do align, you'll easily walk through his team of shadow Pokémon in Pokémon GO.\nSource: PokemonGOHub/Zeroghan\nRiley grew up in the golden era of Xbox vs PlayStation and has fallen in love with RPGs and action-adventure games as a result.

The Starz drama has already delivered two critically acclaimed seasons and deserves another installment.\nFollowing the success of its first two critically acclaimed seasons, anticipation is incredibly high for P-Valley season 3. Based on the play Pu**y Valley, P-Valley is a drama Starz series that explores the lives of the dancers and employees who work at a Mississippi strip club called The Pynk and the struggles they face day-to-day both at and outside their profession. P-Valley features a talented cast of actors such as Brandee Evans, Nicco Annan, and Shannon Thornton who all consistently give fantastic performances.\nAt the end of season 2, the main protagonist Mercedes Woodbine (Evans) officially retires from The Pynk and starts a new journey in her life. Additionally, Lil' Murda (J. Alphonse Nicholson) and Uncle Clifford Sayles (Nicco Annan) officially decide to reveal their secret romance to their friends and loved ones. The season 2 finale has left a lot of storylines open-ended, but how the show plans on exploring these character arcs is still left up to speculation as not much about P-Valley season 3 has been confirmed.\nRelated: 10 Underrated Series On Starz (That Are Secretly Great), Ranked\nIn May 2023, it was announced that P-Valley season 3 would completely halt production due to the WGA (Writers Guild of America) strike. Series creator Katori Hall stated that she supports and provides solidarity for the picketing writers, stating \"We will not be filming until a fair deal is reached\" (via Deadline). While the writer's strike recently officially ended on September 27. 2023, production on P-Valley season 3 will remain halted until the SAG-AFTRA strike comes to an end as well (via NPR).\nIn October 2022, two months after the season 2 finale, it was confirmed that P-Valley would be returning to Starz for a third season. Hall said in a statement, \"I am blessed beyond measure for this opportunity to write the next chapter of P-Valley.

However, should the strike end in 2023, it is possible that P-Valley will be released sometime in mid-to-late 2024.\nWhile P-Valley has yet to make any major confirmation regarding its season 3 cast, it is very likely that most of the main characters from seasons 1 and 2 will be returning. The only actor confirmed not to appear in P-Valley season 3 is Elarica Johnson, who played Autumn Knight, because her character decided to move away at the end of season 2. According to Katori Hall, Autumn has reached the natural end of her character arc, saying \"She was a woman who came in on the wind and her leaving on the wind.\" (via EW)\nIt has yet to be revealed what P-Valley season 3's exact story will be.

Gigs are entirely optional but often can provide some good rewards and experience, in addition to providing some colorful backstory and lore for the game. They can often be triggered by entering an area or through story advancement, and are frequently started with a phone call, but they do not need to be completed immediately, so V can circle back when ready.\n[Warning: The following article contains mild spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.]\nThe DLC Phantom Liberty adds a substantial amount of new content to Cyberpunk 2077 through both its main story of political intrigue and spy escapades, and also the many side jobs and gigs available that are crafted to enlarge the experience. Most of these gigs offer just as much depth of morality and philosophy in their choices, except possibly the gig \"Waiting For Dodger,\" and provide valuable insights into the lore of Dogtown. Below are a few of the best examples of gigs that V can take on in Phantom Liberty.\nRelated: \"Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists\" - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review\n\"Dogtown Saints\" is a gig in Phantom Liberty where players have to rescue Dr. Anthony Anderson, and gives players the first real opportunity to work with Mr. Hands in this expansion. Mr. Hands was previously a large part of Cyberpunk 2077 and continues his role as a fixer in Dogtown, and also becomes a bit more important to the overall plot than he was previously. In \"Dogtown Saints,\" Dr. Anderson is a ripperdoc who works pro bono to help the downtrodden people of Dogtown who don't have anywhere else to turn. His life is in danger, and Mr. Hands and Odell Blanco want V's help to save him. This is a gig that can be done early on in the DLC, as soon as V leaves the Dogtown hideout.\nTo get the result that makes Mr. Hands the happiest, it's best to try to keep everyone alive. The quest has a lot of moral ambiguity, however, which can lead to some thoughtful and philosophical pondering. Naturally, helping save the doctor to be able to reopen the clinic for the citizens of Dogtown is a good thing, but it's also interesting to think about who has the right to make certain choices. The immediate rewards are nothing extra special: 8,000 eddies, 1,300 EXP, and 167 street cred, but players should be sure to loot the clinic as some of the containers and fallen enemies in the area can drop worthwhile loot.\nRelated: There's One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP\n\"Prototype in the Scraper\" is a gig that V receives from Mr. Hands in Phantom Liberty, which has some moral and ethical decisions for players to make. Essentially, it sounds like a fetch quest at first, being asked to retrieve a prototype implant and the schematics for it. Unfortunately, that prototype is already implanted in someone named Hasan.\nHasan is a thief who V has to track down from a scav den in a Dogtown scraper jail cell. After breaking Hasan out, V has a decision to make about whether to give Hasan and the schematics to Mr. Hands, who will turn them all over to Zetatech, and likely torture and kill Hasan, or V can free Hasan and send the schematics to Mr. Hands. Rewards for either choice are the same, although if V lets Hasan go, then they will get a future side job from him that can lead to an Iconic Tech Pistol reward.\nPhantom Liberty's gig \"Waiting for Dodger\" adds a lot of humor to an otherwise very emotionally-heavy game. Any fan of Cyberpunk Edgerunners will also be interested to see that the main NPC that V works with in this gig is a new Phantom Liberty character, Stella Ramos, who is the sister of Sasha Yakovleva from Edgerunners. Stella's fiancée is an officer who looks to be in trouble at first. The entire situation is filled with sarcasm and humor, which is a fun contrast to the fact that it is involving drug dealing. Particularly if players choose to tell Dodger that the two cops are lying, its consequences are surprisingly light-hearted. The best reward, however, will come from killing Dodger, which provides a Tier 4 Iconic revolver named Rosco.\n\"Treating Symptoms\" is a gig in Phantom Liberty where players get to infiltrate the Voodoo Boys hideout, fight killer robots from NetWatch, and deal with a strange problem of someone threatening to hack into a woman's lungs. It is an incredible story to play through, with options for either stealth or heavy combat, and V gets to deal with some unique characters who epitomize the feeling of cyberpunk.\nUltimately, the choice becomes even more complicated when V runs into another undercover agent who is also in the process of completing a mission. The \"Treating Symptoms\" gig provides a lot of opportunities to have some fun roleplay and will pay out 8,000 eddies as a reward, with possibly an extra 8,000 much later on if V chose to help Alan.\nThe gig \"Talent Academy\" is one of the most deep and thought-provoking quests that are offered as an optional side gig, as the consequences for any possible solution can not only be difficult but for some may even hit close to home in real life. It can be emotional, but is also a very interesting commentary on the real world. In \"Talent Academy,\" Mr. Hands asks V to check out a strange Biotechnica sports facility in Dogtown and steal their data. Eventually coming to the computer of a woman named Fiona, V is caught by Fiona and offered a deal. Either Fiona will give them specific, controlled information to bring back to Mr. Hands in a way that won't hurt her company, or refuse, take all the data, and V can fight their way out. The rewards are the same for either option.\nThe tricky part is that this isn't just a normal company. In Phantom Liberty, Fiona is in charge of a sports academy which is taking advantage of children. Sports teams come there to scout out future star athletes, but the Biotechnica sports facility is not simply training kids but is putting cyberware in the children to improve their performance. The entire gig is written very well with dialogue that can make a person think, and the options presented can affect many lives, including a lot of the children in Cyberpunk 2077.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Abracadabra&quot;: Superman's Weakness to Magic Unlocked His Most Powerful Form", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Superman is incredibly powerful, but he does have a few specific weaknesses, including magic — but magic once somehow made him even stronger.\nIt's almost entirely impossible to harm Superman without using one of his very specific weaknesses. Aside from simply hitting him hard enough to bypass his invulnerability, the only way to deal any real damage to the Man of Steel is with either Kryptonite or magic. But when the sun became infused with magic in a strange future, Superman didn't get weaker — he got stronger.\nSince most people don't have the absolutely absurd strength levels it takes to defeat the Man of Steel, the only other options are using Kryptonite or magic. Kryptonite is famously the easiest way to defeat Superman; depending on the story it's either a mild annoyance or will instantly take him out of the fight. The same is true of magic: while Superman is borderline invulnerable, Superman has no defense against magic. This makes it one of the \"easier\" ways to damage him. The other much more complicated solution is to simply remove the sun, as Superman gains his powers from Earth's yellow sun — if he's without it, he's nothing more than a human. So when a group of villains infuses the sun with magic, one might think that would be Superman's worst nightmare, but things don't go exactly as expected.\nRelated: 1 Classic Superman Power Has a Deadly Upper Limit He Refuses to Use\nSuperman's surprising affinity for magic is featured in a dark future from Superman/Batman #82 by Cullen Bunn, ChrisCross, Marc Deering, Brad Anderson, and Steve Wands. After a group of magical villains sacrifice the sun for ultimate power, the magical heroes of DC try to infuse the sun with new life. While this does technically work, the sun begins giving off magical radiation instead of yellow sunlight. This not only shuts down all technology but apparently empowers Superman with magical energy. Instead of Clark being weakened as he usually is, he simply becomes magically adept. It seems that he not only keeps all of his normal powers but even gains a few new ones, as seen when he simply banishes a group of enemies from existence with a single thought.\nWhile most people think Superman's powers are from yellow sunlight, this isn't entirely true. Superman's powers come from radiation, not sunlight specifically. So when this new sun starts giving off magical radiation, instead of weakening Superman, he becomes significantly stronger than usual, just with a different source and outcome. He maintains most of his strength and the ability to fly but also gains new powers such as banishment and a form of \"magic vision\" akin to heat vision. Because of these new powers, Superman can save this dark future and prevent it from ever coming to pass.\nKryptonians have unique biology, and there are many different ways to mess with them. If a Kryptonian is under a yellow sun, they gain significant powers; under a blue sun, they gain even more. If they're under a red sun, they lose all of their powers. But if they're under a Kryptonite sun, it's agonizing pain for them and they lose their powers. If they gain too much yellow sunlight, their powers go out of control, and. apparently, if they're under a magical sun, then Superman becomes one of DC's strongest magical heroes.\nCheck out Superman/Batman #82, available now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "10 Least Likable Characters in One Piece", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "From sniveling brats to oppressive tyrants, One Piece has its fair share of unlikable and despicable but characters but these ones take the cake!\nOne Piece has given fans innumerable beloved characters over the years, each having a unique character design and a signature gag, trait, or laugh that sets them apart from the rest. Regardless, with the series being as vast as it is and with so many characters to choose from there's bound to be some characters that simply aren't all that likable.\nIt is entirely possible to like a character for being an excellent antagonist, as seen with Katakuri, who despite being a major antagonist of his arc, is generally well-loved and respected for wanting a fair fight with Luffy. However, most of the least likable characters in One Piece are simply too despicable to look past despite their narrative role in the series. \nRelated: 10 Strongest Non-Devil Fruit Users In One Piece\nCharlotte Flampe is Big Mom's 77th daughter who was introduced in the midst of Luffy's battle against Katakuri in the mirror dimension during the Whole Cake Island Arc. Flampe is known mainly for her infatuation with Katakuri which borders on obsession as it pushes her to interfere in the battle out of wanting her brother to win. While wanting to help a sibling is far from despicable, Flampe is disliked mostly for her obnoxious, vain personality. What's worse is her infatuation quickly turns into disgust when she learns about Katakuri's mouth. Faced with the reality that Katakuri isn't as perfect as she believed him to be, Flampe turns her nose on him, going as far as to disown him and threaten to gossip about him to the rest of the family.\nSafe to say, Flampe might've been less unlikable if not for her shifty, petty behavior towards her own brother whom she once idolized. It also doesn't help her case that she comes off as quite the nosy brat.\nStelly is Sabo's adopted brother who went on to become the king of the Goa Kingdom. Much like the rest of the nobles there, Stelly looks down on everyone else as inferior to him. Stelly is particularly condescending to Merfolk and Fishmen and holds racist, stereotypical views about them. Not only is Stelly arrogant but also snotty and extremely spoiled as a result of which he often looked down on and insulted even his half-brother Sabo from a young age. Even as an adult, Stelly's attitude towards Sabo remains highly contemptuous, though he did seem shocked when he learned the latter was alive and part of the revolutionaries.\nTo top it off, Stelly also shows signs of being power hungry, evidenced when he saw the empty throne at Mariejois and even though his actions aren't all that atrocious he is still among the least-liked characters in the series.\nAbsalom was a member of the Thriller Bark Pirates with the power of the Clear-Clear Fruit and a penchant for being quite the misogynistic pervert. Even nicknamed 'Erosalam' by the zombies at Thriller Bark, he not only used his fruit to peek at Nami while she was bathing but also abducted her and forced her to marry him all within the little time the Straw Hats spent there. More importantly, Absalom has also expressed how he liked docile women who couldn't fight back like Nami.\nWhile Absalom's behavior is not much different from Sanji's who also used his Germa powers to try and spy on women at a bathhouse, Absalom doesn't have an inkling of respect for women, unlike Sanji. In fact, Absalom's obsession with wanting a bride stems not from romance but from the desire for more of a trophy than a partner which explains his unpopularity in the fandom.\nRelated: 10 Best One Piece Episodes Ranked\nNow the owner of a massive conglomerate, Wapol is the former ruler of Drum Island and the epitome of the word inexorable. During his time on Drum Island, Wapol was a terrible ruler. Besides being incredibly selfish, he is also a huge coward who abandoned his people to fend for themselves when the island was attacked by pirates. More importantly, he destroyed the rich tradition of doctors on the island by keeping twenty of the best ones for himself and hunting down the rest. Wapol's self-centeredness also makes him very petty and arrogant to the point where he did not hesitate to hit a young Vivi simply because her father Cobra had admonished him.\nIn all, there doesn't seem to be any hope for Wapol to redeem himself. Even after losing everything he had after being defeated by Luffy, Wapol went right back to his old, arrogant self after his rise back to money and power.\nSpandam was the ruthless yet cowardly chief of CP9 and the man in charge of capturing Nico Robin. The dislike for Spandam mostly stems from his sadistic treatment of Nico Robin at Enies Lobby where he not only broke his promise not to harm her but also shoved her down the stairs and physically assaulted her. Spandam was ruthless in the sense that he was willing to sacrifice anything to achieve his goal—that is, except himself. When the Straw Hats attacked Enies Lobby he sent the CP9 agents and several subordinates to deal with them instead, proving to be quite the coward despite his arrogance.\nInterestingly, Spandam is one of the earliest examples of the World Government's brand of absolute justice and highlights the worst problems with the Government, as well as its moral grayness. Together with his horrible personality and hypocritical tendencies, this makes Spandam very easy to dislike.\nA simple look at Coco Village and what the Arlong Pirates did to its people is enough to justify why Arlong may not be a fan favorite. Despite Arlong's sentiments towards humans making sense considering the tragic history of the Fishmen, it hardly justifies his actions toward the innocent people of Coco Village as well as the countless other places he ravaged. Arlong not only took all their money but also killed Bellemere and forced a young Nami into working for him. Moreover, he held the village hostage to ensure Nami's loyalty.\nArlong was easily one of the most ruthless, despicable antagonists of the East Blue Saga who wouldn't hesitate to kill even an innocent child. Considering that the Fishmen's past and their strained relationship with humans weren't explored until much later in the series, it does make sense why Arlong may be among the handful of unlikable characters in the series.\nRelated: What Arlong Is In One Piece: Netflix's Live-Action Fishmen Explained\n While nobles are infamously snobbish as proven by Stelly, the Celestial Dragons are a whole different breed among which Saint Charlos stands out most for his arrogance, pretentiousness, and condescending attitude toward everyone around him. However, what strikes viewers the most is his general disregard for life and his poor treatment of his slaves whom he takes pleasure in abusing and tormenting. Saint Charlos represents the worst of the Celestial Dragons, their perceived superiority over every other being on the planet, and everything that's wrong with the World Government as well as the world of One Piece as a whole.\nThe dislike for Akainu stems mostly from his skewed sense of justice. Akainu's belief in absolute justice often causes him to disregard the lives of several marines and innocent civilians. To him, any means are justified as long as he achieves his goal of terminating what he and the World Government deem 'evil'. Akainu's cruelty stands out most during the Ohara Incident where he decimated an entire ship full of civilians off the chance that one of them may be a researcher. In that sense, Akainu's idea of justice is biased towards the Celestial Dragons he serves.\nAdmittedly, Akainu makes for an excellent antagonist and hardly anyone can blame him for killing Ace at Marineford as he was only doing his job. That being said, Akainu's blind obedience to the Celestial Dragons and his ignorance and disregard towards any other life paint him as quite the unlikable character.\nWhile most of One Piece's least likable characters are unlikable because of their actions or beliefs, Trebol is unlikable by virtue of how obnoxious he is. Though Trebol's constant interruptions during Luffy's battle against Doflamingo weren't quite as noticeable in the manga, they could not be any more infuriating in the anime. That being said, Trebol's obnoxious laugh and laid-back persona hide his true, insidious nature, seen when he took advantage of a young embittered and disillusioned Doflamingo and instigated him to a life of crime.\n​​​​\nRegardless of the role Trebol played in Doflamingo's childhood, the fact remains that he's unlikable because he's annoying, meddlesome, and possibly the most repulsive character in the series.\nRelated: 10 Important One Piece Characters Netflix's Remake Will Probably Never Show\nOrochi is easily the most unlikable character in One Piece. In fact, if being a terrible ruler were a competition, Orochi might even give Doflamingo a run for his money. Not only did Orochi underhandedly grab the title of the shogun, but he also sold his people into slavery to a vicious pirate all while starving them by keeping all the resources untouched by pollution to himself. Moreover, Orochi turned on the only man who took him in all out of resentment and his thirst for vengeance. Yet, despite his anger, Orochi could not bring himself to face the Akazaya Nine and Oden, choosing instead to hide behind Kaido like the coward he is.\nOverall, Wano's story is incredibly tragic, and it's hard to believe a man as pathetic as Orochi almost managed to destroy the entire nation which makes it all the more satisfying when Orochi finally meets his fate for his actions.\nAll in all, only time will tell whether any of these characters will get the chance to redeem themselves. Considering Oda's ability to turn characters on their head and the fact that he has surprised readers before with once unlikable characters like Franky even joining the Straw Hats, it's safe to say nothing is entirely impossible. Unlikely as it seems, there may even be a sliver of hope for One Piece characters like Wapol and Akainu.\nMerlyn De Souza is a freelance writer and anime enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature.

{"title": "&quot;Where Did The Bullet Go?&quot; One Of Walking Dead's Biggest Tragedies Has Real Doctor Very Skeptical", "date": "2023-10-05 12:59:39", "text": "ER Doctor Jordan Wagner expresses some skepticism about what the results would be from one of The Walking Dead's biggest tragic injuries.\nER Doctor Jordan Wagner has analyzed a tragic scene from The Walking Dead, expressing skepticism that the character involved would have survived. The zombie series is filled with plenty of horrific death scenes and major characters being permanently injured within the post-apocalypse. Some of these brutal scenes involve injuries that characters survive, but which change them for the rest of the show.\nIn a video from his Doctor ER YouTube channel, Wagner reveals the chances of survival after Carl gets shot in the eye during The Walking Dead season 6, episode 9.\nWagner's analysis, which starts at 6:36, focuses on how the bullet from Ron's gun entered Carl's eye, making it unclear if he would have survived the incident in real life. Check out Wagner's analysis of the classic yet tragic scene below:\n\nWoah! Where did the bullet go?I'm assuming the bullet went into his eye. We'll never be able to recover that, the eye trauma is done. There's no more globe. Now you just have a hole. But now the issue ends up being, where did the bullet go once it actually passed through the eye? Was it going at an angle that it went out the side, or did it go straight through to the back, going through brain tissue?In this situation, put pressure to the wound. Obviously you can't get to a hospital at this point, so hopefully you're not having brain swelling due to the trauma which can cause you to be altered. And then did it actually go into the balance center of the brain, or into the brain stem?The balance center of the brain is your cerebellum. If it hits the brain stem, there's not a lot of survival, because that's where all your autonomic nervous system type function is.\n\nWoah!

If it hits the brain stem, there's not a lot of survival, because that's where all your autonomic nervous system type function is.\nWhile Wagner highlights the many issues that could arise from Carl getting shot in the eye, Rick's son eventually recovers from his injury. While the bullet easily could have damaged his brain, Carl is shown to be fine in season 6, episode 10 following a two-month time jump. While Carl eventually died in The Walking Dead season 8, he was bit by a zombie, which had nothing to do with his eye injury.\nBased on Wagner's statements, it seems unlikely Carl would have survived getting shot in the eye in real life. His analysis indicates the bullet would have been lodged deep in Carl's skull, meaning he would have received brain damage that may not have been treatable in the post-apocalypse. The likelihood the bullet hit Carl's brain stem also indicates a low chance of survival if he'd been shot in real life.\nHowever, just like in The Walking Dead, Carl losing his eye could have resulted in a miraculous survival if the bullet didn't lodge deep enough to pierce his brain. While in real life this may not have been as possible, the event can still be considered realistic despite the low chances of it ever happening. Even so, as Wagner indicates, Carl's survival would still depend on how good his treatment would be.\nSource: Doctor ER/YouTube\n"}

Now, Jesse has launched a new campaign for a new book that will resurrect other Simon characters. Furthermore, this project comes with an introduction by the legendary Alan Moore.\nSimon Studios has launched a Kickstarter for the book, entitled ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past. Simon provided a synopsis for the book, along with the variant covers, shared below. Blast to the Past meta-plot involves Jesse and his father Jim attending a comic book convention in the present day. They are hurled back in time to 1963, where John F. Kennedy needs protection. Kennedy asks the Fighting American to provide security. The Fighting American then brings together a group of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby characters, such as Captain 3-D, The Fly, and Private Strong. The book will feature covers by industry legends such as Tom Morgan and Joe Rubenstein.\nJoe Simon is one of the architects of the American comic book field, whose career spans nearly 80 years. Simon, with Jack Kirby, helped create Captain America, among many other legendary characters at a variety of publishers.

{"title": "Why Bradley & Laura Broke Up Before The Morning Show Season 3", "date": "2023-10-05 12:50:27", "text": "The Morning Show season 3 had already revealed that Bradley and Laura broke up during the time jump, but episode 5 finally explained what went wrong. \nAfter getting together in The Morning Show season 2, Bradley and Laura broke up before season 3 began, and a flashback episode finally explained why, how, and when. The Morning Show cast grew with the addition of Julianna Margulies in its sophomore season as Laura Peterson, a legendary journalist at UBA and Bradley’s love interest. The Morning Show season 2 set up an interesting dynamic between them as Laura had been out as a lesbian for decades while Bradley wasn’t ready to claim her sexuality publicly. Yet, they’d found a way to make their relationship work, only to break up before The Morning Show season 3.\nThough Bradley and Laura started the season having already broken up, there is plenty of time left for them to get back together, especially after The Morning Show season 3, episode 4 where they admitted they still had feelings for each other. However, they also spoke about how miserable Bradley was in Montana, where she and Laura were during the pandemic. The Morning Show season 3, episode 5 took viewers back in time to Laura's ranch to understand why.\nAt the end of The Morning Show season 2, Laura, who has a heart condition, left New York City for her ranch in Montana as an extra measure of caution against COVID-19. Bradley had agreed to join her, but her brother going missing in the finale delayed her trip. In The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, they started off their time in Montana together on a positive note, using the time in isolation to get to know each other and relax away from all the drama they’d been confronted with throughout the season. However, it also meant moving in together more quickly than they might have otherwise.\nBradley and Laura first met at the 2020 Democratic presidential caucus in early February and were living together in Montana by the end of March. Bradley had admittedly never been in a relationship for more than a few months her entire life, while Laura had a reputation as a “player.” With the added difficulties that isolation can have on one's mental and emotional state, it wasn’t exactly surprising that Bradley and Laura broke up during the pandemic before The Morning Show season 3.\nRelated: The Morning Show Season 3 Is Fixing 8 Problems That Ruined Season 2\nAs if trying to make their relationship survive the pandemic and isolation in Montana wasn’t hard enough, Bradley’s mother passed away from the coronavirus in The Morning Show season 3, episode 5. Laura had attempted to get her help through her connections with certain doctors and clinics, but Bradley knew her mother didn’t really take care of herself even when it came to seeing her own doctor, something that Laura couldn’t fully understand. Bradley’s mom’s death understandably marked a shift in their dynamic as she wasn’t willing or ready to accept the help she needed and that Laura tried to offer.\nIn The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, they eventually had an intense argument that led to both of them saying some pretty awful things to each other. Bradley accused Laura of being \"elitist,\" hating her mother, and judging her family, which contributed to her not being as close with her mother in the months before she died. Laura reminded Bradley that she was the one who’d constantly talked down on her family and said that she must actually be relieved that her mother was dead. While they continued their relationship for a while after this fight, it no doubt was the breaking point.\nEven when they were happy together in Montana, their differences posed problems for Bradley and Laura's relationship in The Morning Show from the beginning. They were in very different stages in their lives and careers, with Laura being a successful veteran at UBA and Bradley still trying to prove herself. While Laura attempted to be supportive of Bradley, it could occasionally come across as condescending, as she couldn’t truly understand how Bradley’s messed up childhood was impacting her present and future in The Morning Show.\nRelated: The Morning Show Season 4: Renewal, Release Date & Everything We Know\nBradley and Laura spoke about this in The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, and Laura promised that she’d work on being less judgmental, but Bradley didn’t give her much of a chance once her mother died. Since their breakup, Bradley has gotten some much-needed therapy and the coveted job on UBA Evening News while Laura is co-anchor at Your Day, America, which has eliminated some of their differences. Still, if Bradley and Laura are going to try and make their relationship work again in The Morning Show season 3, they will have to find some middle ground.\n"}
{"title": "Every American Pie Movie, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-05 12:41:24", "text": "The American Pie movies weren't exactly cinematic masterpieces, but there were still some good ones in the bunch. \nThe original American Pie was somewhat of a comedic game-changer in the world of cinema, bringing back raunchy comedy to the masses, but when it comes to the best American Pie movie, there have been several highs and lows since that film hit theaters. Breaking ground in a new way, the studios wanted to keep the magic going for as long as possible turning it into a juggernaut franchise, both with and without the original stars. Audiences flocked to theaters to watch the gang engage in debauchery and laugh along at all the jokes.\nAlong the way, the main movies ended, but the studio kept pumping out films connected to the world of the originals, all with diminishing returns thanks to the absence of the beloved original stars. There are nine movies in the American Pie franchise, but there is a new American Pie movie in the works with the original cast returning. The American Pie movies began in 1999 and the franchise is still releasing new movies as recently as 2020. Although the newer movies aren't as beloved as the original films, there are still new stories to be told in the universe and audiences will continue watching the raunchy sex comedies.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies of All Time\nAmerican Pie Presents: The Book Of Love follows a group of teens exactly 10 years after the original film took place, finding the infamous \"Bible\" that character Kevin Myers used in the original movie. While it pays homage to the first movie, this is far from the best American Pie movie in the franchise. After destroying \"The Bible\" they must track down every man who has contributed any single move to it over the years to try and put it back together. Along the way, they run into Jim's dad Noah Levenstein (Eugene Levy) who is the sort of through-line from the original cast to the younger kids in the \"Presents\" portion of the films.\nThe Book Of Love ranks at the bottom of the DTV sequels to American Pie because by this time, what made the original movies so charming has been mostly lost. Critics mention that the movie tried to return some of the charm of the originals, but it was still just mostly a copy and paste of the ideas that were at one time original and fresh.\nErik Stifler is the cousin of Steve and Matt Stifler from the main franchise and his girlfriend just gave him a free pass to do whatever he wants in one weekend, so he heads off to a college campus to run in The Naked Mile. Erik is not like the hard-partying members of his family and this is meant to help break him out of his shell and so his other crazy cousin Dwight who is already in college tries to acclimate him to the party scene.\nThis whole frat raunchy scene and the connectivity of having it be a Stifler is another way the studio and writers kept the franchise pushing ahead without main cast members attached to the plot line. The movie was not hated like the latter released Book Of Love which didn't star a \"Stifler\" but was also not beloved by audiences. The movie tries to deliver self-aware humor with college craziness, but critics agreed it fell short in the end.\nBeta House was the only American Pie spin-off film to be a direct sequel to the one that came before it. Audiences responded well to Dwight and Erik Stifler, so they were both brought back for this one. Erik left for college and tried to bounce back from his breakup, but the story then went in the same direction as most American Pie movies. This isn't a bad movie, but it isn't anything that movie fans haven't seen before. It checks off most of the college movie tropes one by one, all the way down to the toga party. There are plenty of better college movies out there, and that holds this down from being one of the best American Pie movies.\nFour friends are about to graduate from high school and finally decide to take charge of their lives and get what they want in their senior year. Whether it's losing their virginity or blackmailing the principal, Annie, Kayla, Michelle, and Stephanie spend the raunchy movie doing whatever it takes to find success. The movie arrived in 2020 and tried new approaches, focusing more on the women characters.\nThe change of focus to the women makes it just different enough to stand out from the rest of the best American Pie movies, as far as the spinoffs go. On a side note, Eugene Levy didn't return for this movie, and his absence is felt as he's appeared in every other movie in the franchise.\nThe first movie following the initial trilogy, American Pie Presents: Band Camp was a bit bigger than every American Pie movie made after it with both Eugene Levy and Chris Owen returning as Noah Levenstein and Sherman respectively. The movie follows Matt Stifler who is ordered to attend band camp following a prank and hijinx ensue. Actor Tad Hilgenbrink actually did a pretty great job mimicking Seann William Scott's mannerisms as Stifler. The cast overall was pretty well-rounded for a direct-to-video release, but it was hard for audiences to move on in just two years' time from the cast that had been there since the start.\nThe third film was meant to be the last American Pie movie in the entire franchise. It showed a lot of character development for Steve Stifler, yet there was a big Oz-sized hole in the gang that fans had come to know and love. Groups that are that tight-knit just don't function as well when they are not whole. Each film gave more screen time and more character development to different characters, and it seemed intentional, until the third when Oz was gone and Kevin was essentially non-existent.\nThis was seen by many fans and critics as the weakest in the best American Pie movies. While it is about Jim's wedding, these events are supposed to be group effort films and this left some key players on the sidelines.\nOf the best American Pie movies, this one is the most laugh-out-loud funny of the entire franchise due to the rapid-fire nature of the raunchy jokes. This film was made at a time when nothing was off-limits, many of the jokes would not be okay in today's climate whatsoever. At the same time, the second movie dealt with a lot of issues that many teens deal with in real life when going off to college. The core of the film, staying connected no matter what changes is actually extremely beautiful and that is why many fans connect so deeply with it to this day.\nThe jokes flowing freely make it feel like it could be any group of friends at any house just holding onto their youth. It also helps that all the friends are still in full force here, something the next movie mistakenly changed. The main story here is Jim and Michelle's romance, and that really helps ground a movie that throws just about everything at the audience for a laugh.\nRegarded by many fans and critics as the closest to the first one in tone as well as humor, the fact that everyone returned to the cast was enough to get fans to head back to theaters for an international box office total of $234 million (via Box Office Mojo). The cast seemed to not miss a beat as they delivered quick-witted lines just like no time had passed as well as those heartfelt group moments the franchise had become known for. The writers also made sure to drop in some moments that were fresh to the franchise as well as acknowledging the age of everyone involved in a comedic way. It even picked up three Teen Choice Award nominations.\nThe best of the American Pie movies was a raunchy comedy that brought back the genre in a viable way as a box office smash as well as a genre in which audiences were ready to receive stories again. Not since Animal House had a raunchy comedy lifted the genre in such a way that it became the talk of all of Hollywood, and that is why this remains timeless movie. The first American Pie movie followed a group of friends and their dating and sexual relationships as they finished high school and prepared for the day they would end up moving apart.\nWhat really carried the movie was the cast, which included Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan as the key romantic couple that carried the franchise, at least through the theatrical American Pie movies. This movie was also the one that received the most accolades, including nominations at the MTV Movie Awards and Teen Choice Awards and several wins at the Young Hollywood Awards.\n\n"}

{"title": "X-Men MCU Movie Update Makes An Avengers 5 & 6 Theory Much More Exciting", "date": "2023-10-05 12:30:28", "text": "A recent update on the development of the MCU X-Men movie has helped to validate a theory about Avengers 5 and 6 that makes them much more exciting.\nThe excitement surrounding the introduction of the MCU iteration of the X-Men has just been supercharged thanks to an update that lends credence to an Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars theory. The anticipation surrounding the arrival of the newest iteration of the X-Men has started to reach fever pitch, even warranting a tongue-in-cheek mention in She-Hulk as Jennifer Walters asks K.E.V.I.N. when they are due as a favor to the fans. Unfortunately, it got no straight answer - but a recent development in the real world has given a pretty big clue, instead.\nNow that the Writers Guild of America strikes have ended, it is full steam ahead on developing the MCU X-Men movie - something which was confirmed by Marvel's recent call-out for writer pitches for its \"anticipated X-Men movie.\" The decision on who will be picked to write the movie will then be decided \"at the top of 2024,\" and it is this that gives a clue on when thee X-Men as individuals will start making their appearances. Specifically, it will probably be in the next two Avengers movies.\nRelated: All The X-Men Movies In Chronological Order\nWith development now in its earliest stages, it's extremely likely that the MCU's X-Men movie will be a Phase 7 release. Every upcoming Marvel movie release so far includes many anticipated MCU introductions such as Blade and the Fantastic Four, meaning the X-Men can hold off on their grand entrance for another phase. This is a good thing for ensuring the anticipation for their arrival builds - but it doesn't mean that none of the MCU's X-Men will appear in other capacities before then. Nor would that make sense.\nDeadpool 3 is looking poised to have fun with a roster of Fox's X-Men, but will likely be used to draw a line under that franchise before moving on with a new cast. With the likes Spider-Man and Black Panther being introduced ahead of their own solo outing, however, it is still extremely possible that the X-Men will be introduced ahead of theirs. Nowhere would this be more appropriate than in Avengers: Secret Wars - and it would be a wise move.\nIn a sense, the MCU has already been laying the groundwork for the introduction of the X-Men by establishing a number of MCU mutants already. The X-Men specifically, though, comprise a lot of iconic individuals, and introducing them all at once would probably be too much for one solo movie. Instead, establishing someone like Wolverine, Professor X, or Magneto ahead of time will help make the group outing easier to manage. Although it is still possible that an X-Man or two might appear before the new Avengers movie, the multiverse focus of each seems to set them both up to be the place that the MCU X-Men will start to be drip-fed to the audience, which is an incredibly exciting prospect.\nOllie discovered his love for all things nerdy very early on in life and has only gotten nerdier with age after only discovering the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in his 30s.

{"title": "10 Horror Movies That Changed The Rules Forever", "date": "2023-10-05 12:30:28", "text": "From Psycho to Saw, these essential spooky movies broke all the rules when they were released, and would ultimately change the horror genre forever.\nThe horror genre is arguably the most inventive genre in movies, and some horror films have been so groundbreaking that they changed the genre's conventions completely. By altering the genre's fundamental aspects and audience expectations, these movies were able to deliver highly effective scares. The result was that they completely changed the horror movie landscape, influencing all that came next.\nHorror is a genre known for pushing the boundaries, but some movies pushed them so far that they broke and were never the same again. From Alfred Hitchcock to Wes Craven, several horror maestros have shaped the genre in very substantial ways. This was only achieved by bucking previous horror movie standards, and completely breaking the previous rules.\nBefore Night of the Living Dead, zombies were voodoo slaves, sometimes (but not always) raised from the dead. Movies like White Zombie popularized the monsters, which while lumbering and mindless, were not the flesh-devourers audiences now know. George A. Romero's first zombie movie, however, changed this forever. Instead, 1968's Night of the Living Dead featured undead zombies hungry for human flesh. While Romero refrained from terming them zombies, a string of imitations were released which were happy to incorporate the designation, and thus, the modern zombie was born.\nThe next major development with zombie movies was Danny Boyle's 2002 movie, 28 Days Later​​​​​. Rather than living dead, these creatures moved very quickly, infected with a rage virus that triggered cannibalistic murder and extreme violence. Like Romero, Boyle was careful not to call his monsters \"zombies,\" and instead opted for the \"infected.\" The result was two-fold: firstly, subsequent zombie movies employed this speedier, more lethal updated zombie; and secondly, zombie movies garnered a connection with infection - leading to a string of contagion movies.\nBefore 1960's Psycho, cinemas would play movies on a loop, and patrons could arrive whenever they desired - staying to watch the beginning of the movie as necessary. Alfred Hitchcock changed this, and not just for horror. Concerned audiences would spoil the ending for themselves, Hitchcock insisted that nobody be allowed entry after the screening commenced. This would ultimately become somewhat standard in all cinema. If this wasn't enough, Hitchcock also made the bold move to kill off the movie's star (Janet Lee) in the opening act. This was later lampooned by Scream, which also used it to undermine the audience's presumption of the upcoming plot.\nIt seems most horror movies these days deploy a last-minute scare, jolting its audience one final time. Typically, these occur after the perceived threat has been defeated - leaving speculation open to the horrors continuing after audiences are safely exiting the cinema. This, however, never existed before the 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie. Brian De Palma's classic waited until the very end before delivering one final fright, Carrie's hand thrusting its way through the rubble and grasping a survivor. While it may appear like a tiresome trope to modern viewers, this scene startled audiences to their core in 1976. A later famous example comes at the end of Friday the 13th.\nOne of the most enduring images in British horror cinema depicts Edward Woodward (as Howie the police officer) trapped in a giant wicker man, burning to death as the sun sets, during the final scenes of Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man. Audiences in 1976, however, were not used to seeing the protagonist die at the end of the film, and many expected (as would be the case in most other horror movies) an imminent rescue for the hero. This rescue does not arrive though, and Woodward's character perishes in the flames as the pagan islanders sing below. This was highly controversial at the time of release and would be a tactic repeated throughout modern horror movies.\nNow an immensely popular horror subgenre, found footage first appeared in 1980's Cannibal Holocaust, which enjoyed a cult following for years. One movie inspired by this, and that arguably popularized the technique, was 1999's The Blair Witch Project. Alongside the movie, the filmmakers created a swathe of fictional material presented as fact, including websites and documentaries, which explored the movie's themes and purported backstory. Additionally, the actors were marked as missing on their IMDB.com profiles, perpetuating the ruse. This cemented the idea for the public and truly blurred the lines between fact and fiction - a theme that persists in horror to this day.\nJames Whale's classic, The Bride of Frankenstein is a masterpiece in early horror. Released in 1935, the movie was a sequel to Whale's hugely popular Frankenstein, adapting the remainder of Mary Shelley's novel. However, many audiences did not realize, and wouldn't for years to come, that Bride of Frankenstein is a surreptitious spoof of Frankenstein. Packed with campy characters and melodrama, Whale took his own movie and exaggerated the elements he found amusing, contrasting them against Boris Karloff's incredible reprisal as the Monster. This technique would be repeated by Tobe Hooper, who released a sneaky parody of his own horror classic with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2.\nDespite featuring one of the most iconic villains in horror history, Hellraiser made a brilliant, and unconventional, decision to have another antagonist than Pinhead. Though still featured dismembering victims with his trademark chains throughout, Pinhead is a side character in the original 1987 Hellraiser, with the human Frank taking the villainous mantle. Frank appears as a violent degenerate, leching over his brother's wife and child, and orchestrating much of the movie's horrors. Frank is so detestable, that by the movie's conclusion audiences are actually rooting for Pinhead to dispatch the man. In fact, Frank proved such a wretched villain that he would appear in the sequel.\nAnother horror franchise with a secondary character so deplorable viewers root for the villain is Saw, most specifically Saw X. Saw X did such a brilliant job at fleshing out the murderer Jigsaw and his battle with cancer, that when he is duped into fake treatment by the detestable Dr. Cecilia Pederson, audiences feel sorry for him. It is quite an astonishing phenomenon, which transforms the villain fans love to hate, to a villain people just plain love. Saw has always walked the relatable villain tightrope, proffering some justification for the horror committed by Jigsaw, but Saw X reorients him as one of the victims, fully undermining the binary horror convention of good vs. evil.\nAn earlier film that flipped the victim/villain archetypes was Wes Craven's seminal The Last House on the Left. It initially depicts the murder of a young woman by some truly vile characters. Then rather unexpectedly, the movie shifts. The killers seek refuge in a remote house, which, unbeknownst to them, is their victim's home. Deducing what happened, her parents seek their bloody revenge. The movie questions notions of justifiable violence and does so by also placing the audience in the awkward position of cheering for the parents to murder the reprobates. It is a truly disgusting movie that broke several rules in horror, but this one still feels particularly unsettling.\n"}
{"title": "Where Was The Boogeyman Filmed? 2023 Horror Movie's Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 12:20:29", "text": "Though The Boogeyman looks like it could have been filmed in any American suburb, the horror flick actually took place in one specific, spooky city.\nThe Stephen King adaptation The Boogeyman has the look of a movie that could take place just about anywhere, making it all the more scary, however as it turns out, the horror film was actually shot in one particular place. The Boogeyman is a 2023 horror movie following teenager Sadie and her younger sister Sawyer as the grief the sudden death of their mother, and at the same time, begin to contend with a shadowy monster inside their home. The film is adapted from a 1973 short story of the same name by horror legend Stephen King.\nPart of what makes The Boogeyman so creepy is the sense that the events of the film could happen to anyone, anywhere. Though the audience watches the Harper family be terrorized by The Boogeyman monster, the smallness of the film's world makes it seem like the viewers could just as easily be the victims. This ambiance is created by building a narrow and generic world through which the film takes place. Audiences follow Sadie at home, at school, and around town, but the movie goes no further than that. Therefore, Sadie's world could just as easily be ours. However, The Boogeyman was filmed somewhere, so where is it?\nRelated: The Boogeyman 2: Is It Happening? Plot Setup & Everything We Know\nAccording to The Cinemaholic, one generic location that The Boogeyman used during filming was McDonogh 35 Senior High School, located in Louisiana. The school is located on 4000 Cadillac Street in the city of New Orleans. Although The Boogeyman is a horror movie, this school is not abandoned or creepy in any sense. In fact, McDonogh 35 Senior High School is still in use, with actual students in attendance currently. It is unclear how production of The Boogeyman affected the school.\nThe use of McDonogh 35 Senior High School comes into play in The Boogeyman during the scenes when Sadie is at school. This mostly occurs near the start of the film, particularly when Sadie returns to school for the first time after her mother's death. In one scene, Sadie is approached by a group of cruel popular girls, and she gets into an altercation with them. Clearly, The Boogeyman's use of this real-life Louisiana school helped in creating a generic atmosphere. Sadie's school looks entirely real, and like any other high school where this could happen to anybody.\nThe rest of The Boogeyman was filmed in other areas of New Orleans, Louisiana. This is an interesting location because of its history of creepy activity, and also, its recognizable locales. In an interview with NOLA, director Rob Savage said \"We wanted this to feel like Anytown, USA — like every Stephen King movie. You want it to feel like it could be anywhere, like it could be your hometown. But when I first got to New Orleans, the aesthetic qualities were so powerful, I was really pushing to get more and more of that in the movie.\" So, despite the fact that Savage desired a broad look for The Boogeyman, New Orleans' unique tones won out.\nApart from McDonogh 35 Senior High School, the rest of The Boogeyman was filmed in and around New Orleans. Presumably, the filmmakers shot vast amounts of the film in the New Orleans suburbs, including the scenes in the Harpers' home like the fiery final sequence at the end of The Boogeyman. Though Savage was taken by the city's spooky atmosphere, the film still feels encompassing enough to be anywhere. In this way, The Boogeyman strikes a balance between being relatable and atmospheric.\nSources: The Cinemaholic, NOLA\n"}

Here are the best medieval TV shows available.  \nThere's been quite the upswing in shows centered around the Middle Ages — or are at least influenced by the culture and events during this significant era, and this has resulted in some of the best medieval TV shows on the small screen. There is more to these TV and streaming shows than just knights in shining armor on horseback or kings and queens battling rebellious commoners or Vikings. These shows bring a piece of history to the small screen with all the drama and action that a viewer could want to not only enjoy the era but learn more about the past.\nIt's not surprising that viewers would be intrigued by such efforts, whether fantasy-based, historical fiction, or an accurate portrayal of real events. After all, this turbulent, dark, and often violent period of human history makes for some gripping settings and engrossing narratives. While Game of Thrones brought a true fantasy-level effort to the show, others have proven to be memorable because they were based on reality. The good news is that there is a wide selection of options for those looking for the best medieval TV shows, whether it be for their tone, their battle sequences, or compelling protagonists.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked\nBritannia is one of the best medieval TV shows on Amazon Prime Video and is a good companion show for more popular series like Rome and Vikings. The time frame of this series is 43 AD and the battle between the Romans and Celts. What makes this different from other shows in the genre is the fact that Britannia features warrior women, magical Druids, and Celtic Queens, and gives fans of medieval entertainment a show with a strong female slant. The series ran for three seasons on Amazon Prime Video and ended just shortly after the Roman invasion of Britain.\nVinland Saga brings the world of the best medieval TV shows into the anime format. There are several anime options when looking at medieval stories, but Vinland Saga sits at the top of the list as the best of the best. Based on the Makoto Yukimura manga series, this follows protagonist Thorfinn, a former warrior of a band of pirates led by Askeladd. He is also the son of one of the world's greatest warriors, Thors. Vinland Saga, which just finished season 2, is set in the world of Vikings, this is a revenge story that sees Thorfinn going after the man who killed his father, and his rise into legend as his journey continues.\nThe Legend of El Cid remains one of the best medieval TV shows on Amazon Prime Video. Set in the 11th century, the Spanish historical drama follows the life of Ruy, a young squire who uncovers a scandal that involves a conspiracy to murder and a plan to commit regicide. However, by bringing this to everyone's attention, Ruy puts himself and his loved ones in danger. Partially inspired by the story of the real-life knight and nobleman, El Cid received praise for the way it manages to build suspense and gripping cliffhangers. The fact that the characters aren't one-dimensional has compelled the viewers to stick with the show.\nAlthough it only ran for two seasons, Knightfall stands as one of the best medieval TV shows ever made. Set in the 14th century, Knightfall was a series that explored the lives of several soldiers in the Knight Templar as they tried to keep their power and influence in the Holy Land. While there were a few who criticized the plot and uneven storytelling, many believed that the directors more than made up for it with the battle sequences and the fight choreography. There are also some dynamic characters as well as some compelling and complex villains (which viewers will love to hate).\nWith three seasons and a star-studded cast under its belt, Medici stands out as one of the best medieval TV shows. Chronicling the rise and fall of the infamous Italian family, Medici is a series that is full of corruption, rivalries, and political strife (which has viewers engaged from the get-go). It's not all full of drama either, as the writers also managed to find a perfect balance between romance and action. While Medici wasn't always historically accurate since they had to dramatize a few events for the sake of some storyline, it does provide an insight into how influential and powerful the Medicis were in 15th-century Florence.\nWhether it's the cool battle sequences, the interesting storylines (that are inspired by the Legend), or because it has some of the best characters, Merlin has managed to captivate the audience for years as one of the best medieval TV shows. Although Merlin isn't historically accurate (especially in terms of costumes and doesn't exactly follow the classic tales), some viewers might not care since the show does focus a lot on fantasy and include a lot of mythological creatures. There's not a lot of blood or gore either, so it's great for those who want something light-hearted and fun.\nHoning in on Polo's years in the court of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Empire, Marco Polo mostly diverges from Western themes, focusing instead on China circa the Yuan Dynasty. Although this Netflix series only lasted 2 seasons, it's rich with character drama containing twists and turns, along with lavish set pieces loosely based on Eastern history. Its robust budget of $200 million can be seen in its rich cinematography and sleek production value, making it one of the best looking of the best medieval TV shows on Netflix.\nBeing based on a historical novel, this miniseries crams a wealth of interesting backstories and authenticity into each of its eight episodes. As viewers would imagine from a show based on an English civil war called \"The Anarchy,\" there are plenty of gripping, dramatic moments to be had in one of the best medieval TV shows. The show keeps a narrow focus on the one hand - revolving around the construction of a cathedral while granting a deep and vast narrative involving several unique characters. Lavish backdrops, along with standout performances by Ian McShane and Hayley Atwell, give The Pillars of the Earth an enriching sense of authenticity.\nThe cutthroat era of Europe 1,000 years ago seems rife with potential when it comes to compelling murder mysteries. This British series from the mid-90s takes advantage of this, crafting engaging crime plots dressed in 12th-century English settings. One of the best medieval TV shows, it takes the premise of Columbo and fuses it with Game of Thrones motifs, making for a distinctly entertaining show. Even with the fun potential of the protagonist's background as a Crusader-turned-Monk, Cadfael focuses on dynamic writing and interesting plots to keep its viewers enticed rather than action.\nWhile Michael Hirst is perhaps most known for his work on Vikings, a similarly dense, compelling historical drama of his found its way on BBC years before. The Tudors takes place several centuries after that show, honing in on England in the period between the Dark Ages and Modernity; the Renaissance. This transitional era sets the stage for a wealth of major events, and Hirst takes advantage of this. While The Tudors runs with some creative liberties, the show uses both fiction and history to round out one of the best medieval TV shows about King Henry VIII.\nIt's true that a cartoon centered around talking mice isn't exactly authentic to history. Yet, this whimsical fantasy uses medieval themes to paint this majestic scene while also appealing to kids. This Canadian animation draws from the popular fantasy novels by Brian Jacques, with each of its three seasons comprising a different book. Focusing on a once-poor mouse named Matthias, the show captures the often gritty nature of medieval living, while balancing it with lighthearted humor. A number of colorful characters and fun fantasy themes round out this charming cartoon.\nRELATED: The Game Of Thrones Jon Snow Spinoff - News, Cast, & Everything We Know\nAnyone who loved Game of Thrones, but wanted to see something that was a bit more on the mark historically should seek out the docudrama Rise of Empires: Ottoman, one of the best medieval TV shows on Netflix. Forget about the fantastical demons and monsters from Game of Thrones. The real-life historical events this series focuses on are just as dramatic and exciting as any supernatural attack. Rise of Empires: Ottoman deals with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire and looks at the successors in Constantinople and the creation of Istanbul after the conquest by Mehmed II.\nBased largely upon the reign of Queen Isabella of Castile, Isabel has proven to be quite an underrated addition to the best medieval TV shows. Like GoT, this series shows the rise to power of various major figures of royal families, along with the inevitable drama, struggles, and clashes that come with them. This short-lived Spanish show features terrific performances by Michelle Jenner as Isabel, Rodolfo Sancho as Ferdinand of Aragon, and Pablo Derqui as Henry of Castile. This is enhanced by some authentic Spanish settings and complex societal/political happenings, including the voyage of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Inquisition.\nWhile there are a number of the best medieval TV shows loosely based on English history of the Middle Ages, BBC Two's The Hollow Crown portrays this period from a more accurate and authentic angle, honing in on major events like the Wars of the Roses. The show draws from the captivating works of Shakespeare's second tetralogy, which includes plays such as The Life and Death of King Richard II. The authentic set pieces, tremendous acting by Benedict Cumberbatch, Judi Dench, and others, and the rich source material offer a solid foundation for this action-tinged drama.\nWhile there are plenty of the best medieval TV shows that focus on the late Middle Ages, The Last Kingdom revolves around the even more violent and cutthroat era of 9th-century England. As it dates back to a time of instability, where Britain is fractured into various (often warring) kingdoms - drama, strife, and outright conflict are guaranteed. It also shows the further destabilizing factor of the Northmen raiders becoming emboldened and mounting assaults on the island. The Last Kingdom sets the stage for some intense and epic battle scenes rarely seen on television. A plethora of enticing narratives and rich characters help flesh out this epic historical show.\nIt's tough to find a more iconic blend of history and mythology than the legendary Robin Hood; a figure who's seen no shortage of adaptations over the years and decades. One of the lesser-known, but nonetheless stronger examples of this folklore hero come in the form of the British TV series, Robin of Sherwood, by Richard Carpenter. While it now seems like a mere distant blip on the radar, running from 1984 to 1986, this drama quietly developed a cult following thanks to its gripping portrayal which blends realism with imaginative mythology, enhanced by an engrossing atmosphere.\nSome areas of history don't even need to be decorated with many fictional or fantastical elements to be entertaining. Such is the case with Vikings, the epic Michael Hirst portrayal of 9th-century Scandinavian society. That's not to say creative liberties aren't taken, yet the grandiosity and fun plots of this action-drama do largely draw from real Viking events and cultural traits. One of the best medieval TV shows, it distills this tale down to a rather simple premise of raiders and explorers seeking a more prosperous new life with new lands. The popularity of Vikings even spawned a spinoff series.\nWhile there are quite a few glimpses into the wondrous and often dark events of the Middle Ages in Europe, this South Korean epic from 2015 demonstrates that the East is similarly rife with thrilling tales of heroism and political strife. The Korean period drama Six Flying Dragons merges real and fictional characters along with settings and premises loosely based on real events. Specifically, it portrays the founding of the Joseon Dynasty in the 14th century, where Neo-Confucianism began to reside over Buddhism, and a cascade of change elsewhere resided over this society, shown through the eyes of Prince Lee Bang Won.\nDespite its brief seven-episode run and the cinematic limitations as a result of the dated '70s production, this French-German swashbuckling tale is nonetheless a rich and entertaining watch. The show follows a Scottish adventurer by the name of Quentin, who finds himself in the midst of a feud that wipes out his entire clan. The series, part of an unofficial trilogy that included King Arthur movie Knights of the Round Table, sees the downtrodden protagonist must find his way in this hostile environment while he heads to France to rendezvous with his only living relative and reach the French court of Louis XI.\nVikings: Valhalla is the spinoff of the original Vikings series and remains one of the best medieval TV shows on TV as it released its second season in 2023. The series takes place 100 years after the previous series ended and details the Norse quest to conquer England after the St. Brice's Day massacre in 1002 A.D. The three Vikings the show focuses on are Harald Sigurdsson, Leif Erikson, and Freydis Eirsdottir. Like the original series, there are a lot of historical characters and events in the series, mixed judiciously with fictional events and characters to create high drama and a very exciting follow-up to the original series as well as the best medieval TV show.\n"}

{"title": "The Boogeyman Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 12:10:26", "text": "The Boogeyman ties up its loose ends and sees Sadie battling the titular monster. We break down the film's ending & the changes from the short story.\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for The BoogeymanThe Boogeyman’s ending ties things up, but teases a potential second chapter to the story. Directed by Rob Savage from a screenplay by ​​Scott Beck, Bryan Woods, Mark Heyman, The Boogeyman is adapted from Stephen King’s short story of the same name. The horror film, which has received mostly positive reviews from critics, includes a final scene that suggests the story may not be over, and that The Boogeyman 2 could potentially be on the horizon.\nThe Boogeyman ends with Sadie (Sophie Thatcher), Sawyer (Vivien Lyra Blair), and Will Harper (Chris Messina) battling the titular creature. The Boogeyman is intent on killing Sadie and Sawyer, and uses Will as bait after killing Rita, Lester Billings’ wife. After a few violent attacks, Sadie and Sawyer set fire to the terrifying creature. Seemingly dead, the house also catches fire, but Sadie and her family are able to make it outside to safety. Sadie and Sawyer return to therapy, and Will finally talks about his grief. After the session, Sadie hears the voice of the therapist, but the closet door is open, indicating The Boogeyman’s presence.\nSadie hears what she believes is her therapist’s voice calling out to her, but when she enters the room there’s no one there. The closet opens on its own and as Sadie draws closer, there’s a sense that the creature is still around, taunting her. She’s pulled back to reality by the actual therapist, and The Boogeyman is never shown. But after a fiery end, could The Boogeyman still be alive? It’s possible Sadie is hearing things after such a traumatic experience. She’s still reeling from what happened, but it could also be that a creature like The Boogeyman never truly dies, haunting its victims until they’re dead.\nThe Boogeyman stays in the shadows and shies away from light, therefore it can only be bested by fire. Fire is the original source of light discovered by humans, and brought people out of the dark at night. Hypothetically, this also kept the monsters at bay, so it makes sense that The Boogeyman, an ancient creature, would be afraid of fire; it’s the one thing that can cause it physical harm. Humans can wield fire to combat it, since the creature can control regular lights, flicking them off at will. It’s why Rita had so many candles lit in her house, which kept The Boogeyman at bay.\nThe monster called The Boogeyman has many origin points. First and foremost, what The Boogeyman is can be traced back to a short story written by Stephen King. The story follows a man named Lester Billings, who is telling a therapist, Will Harper, about the monster terrorizing him and his family. In terms of the movie's lore, The Boogeyman's origins are somewhat murky, but it's clear that it has existed for quite a long time. Furthermore, The Boogeyman seemingly appears after a significant trauma has occurred, or an individual is overcome with grief. The Boogeyman also targets children over adults, therefore, a grieving child like Sadie is the perfect target.\nThe Boogeyman latches onto those who are emotionally vulnerable. The Boogeyman sought out children specifically because they were easier to scare, preying on their weaknesses and emotional exposure in a way that it couldn’t do as easily with adults. Children and teenagers were also less likely to be believed by adults regarding what they were seeing, thus isolating them completely from their support systems. This allows The Boogeyman to lurk and toy with its prey, mimicking the voices children trusted, including their parents, to lure them into the shadows before attacking. Without the emotional vulnerability, the creature wouldn’t be as strong as it is.\nThe creature set its sights on Sadie and Sawyer after following Lester to their home. The sisters were still emotionally raw from the death of their mother a month before, and they were grieving her loss. Their guards were down, making it easy for The Boogeyman to make them its victims. Unlike their father, Sadie and Sawyer were open about their grief. They were also isolated — Sadie couldn’t rely on her friends or Will, who refused to talk about his wife or openly grieve like his daughters, and Sawyer faced The Boogeyman alone at first since no one believed her.\nWhen Lester (David Dastmalchian) comes to Will Harper for help after The Boogeyman killed Lester's kids, the creature continues taunting him until he is dead. Though the nightmarish creature tends to only go after children, it likely went after Lester because he actually believed The Boogeyman existed, and he felt guilty about not being there for his kids. Lester believed his children when they said they saw it, and he was vulnerable emotionally, wanting others to know that the monster existed. Will, on the other hand, was in denial; he was also less vulnerable, closed off emotionally from himself and his kids.\nThe Boogeyman’s ending teases that the creature is not actually dead, and that it could come back to attack Sadie and Sawyer. The Boogeyman is relentless in preying on its victims, and there’s no way to determine whether the monster is permanently dead or if setting it on fire was just a temporary setback. It’s possible the creature could return, terrorizing Sadie and Sawyer until they’re dead before setting its sights on another family. Battling the ancient monster again could be redundant, but The Boogeyman left off in a way that sees Sadie’s family united, which might force the creature to up its game in a sequel.\nStephen King’s short story is wildly different from the film adaptation. Whereas the short story is focused on a long conversation between Lester Billings and Will Harper, The Boogeyman movie expands the story to include Will’s daughters. In the source material, Sadie and Sawyer don’t factor into the story at all; they’re created for the film adaptation. In fact, Lester is the main character, and The Boogeyman short story follows his retelling of the events leading to the death of his three kids, ending with him coming face-to-face with the creature. Everything after that is an addition. It’s only after Lester dies in the movie that the story truly begins.\nThe Boogeyman attaches grief and emotional vulnerability with a monster preying on victims. Despite Sadie and her family getting to a much better place, with Will openly talking about the loss of his wife and The Boogeyman seemingly dying in physical form, the film suggests that grief will continue to be prevalent in one’s life no matter how much time has passed. Discussing it openly and allowing oneself to feel the sadness and loss of a loved one helps, but grief lingers. So regardless of Sadie defeating The Boogeyman and going to therapy with her family, the trauma remains, even if it’s no longer a physical manifestation.\n"}
{"title": "12 Things You Didn't Know About John Wick's Dogs", "date": "2023-10-05 12:10:26", "text": "The John Wick franchise is likely known for 3 things by now; Keanu Reeves being back, Keanu Reeves' Training Regime, and dogs. \nThe John Wick franchise is likely known for two things by now - Keanu Reeves' training regime and the John Wick dogs. It's strange to think a series of action films that have done so well critically and financially are equally popular with fans of high-octane tightly choreographed gun-fu action sequences and lovers of canine companions. Dogs have been so centric to the John Wick films that they've acted as motivation for Wick's revenge, helped him in his recovery, and aided John in fights. The first John Wick movie was all about his dog, as the bad guys killed the pup (Daisy), that was sent to him by his deceased wife.\nThe dog is what sent John Wick on his mission of vengeance to begin with. John got another dog, a pitbull, in the John Wick ending, and he has been his good boy and companion ever since. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum introduces combat dogs, and John Wick: Chapter 4's dog brings the franchise full circle. The dogs have played almost as big a role as any human and are more trustworthy than most. With that in mind, it's no surprise that there are many dog-related facts pertaining to the action series, and there's more to the John Wick dogs than the movies reveal.\nDaisy, the John Wick dog whose death inspired the line \"Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back,\" was played by an animal actor named Andy. It was actually his first role, at eight months old, purchased from a breeder specifically for the film. According to Animal Actors International trainer Kim Krafsky, a beagle was picked because \"There's this thing about them, they're just cute\" (via New York Post). Andy took to the press circuit with the rest of the cast. Following his big-screen debut, Andy took some time off, spending it on the Animal Actors International farm in New Jersey.\nJohn Wick has had two faithful four-legged companions. In the franchise sequels, John is joined by a pitbull named Bubba. Originally though, Wick owned a beagle named Daisy, left to him by his deceased wife who was tragically murdered spurring the events of the first film. Arguably, the death of this John Wick dog was the thing that made his unending revenge kill streak relatable. However, John Wick director Chad Stahelski revealed that they almost didn't go through with the dog's death. The director explained:\n\"We were risking credit cards, a house mortgage, everything. [Producer] Basil Iwanyk put his company up. And then you have that day where you realize we’re doing all this and we’re killing a puppy? I thought we would never come back from it.\"\nUnfortunately, Daisy dies in the first ten minutes of John Wick, but in the film's final scenes, John adopts a pitbull to save it from being put down. This John Wick dog has been played by two different animals in both John Wick: Chapter 2 and John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. Chapter 2 saw the part played by Burton (who Keanu took to calling Bubba), and then Cha Cha in Parabellum (via Pup Help). John's second sidekick has yet to be given a name, likely because the assassin doesn't want to get too attached. Not even John Wick: Chapter 4 revealed the John Wick dog's name.\nA common saying in Hollywood goes\" \"Never work with children or animals,\" inferring that they will steal every scene they're in, and often make shooting said scenes more difficult. This was definitely the case while filming the third John Wick movie in New York. The animal actor Cha Cha, the second dog who played Wick's pitbull, picked a fight with a horse. Luckily Cha Cha came out of the altercation unharmed. It was likely caused by the onset of chaos due to the stress of shooting in such a loud and high-pressure environment, especially as even the horses were involved in the action sequences.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick calls in a favor from the manager of the Casablanca branch of the Continental Hotel, Sofia Al-Awar (Halle Berry). The character constantly has two Belgian Malinois Shepherds by her side, but these dogs weren't played by only two dogs. They were in fact played by five separate stunt dogs so that different animal actors could be used for different stunts, and so that no individual dog became too stressed or fatigued. The John Wick dogs were named; Santana, Tai, Sam 7, Boyca, and Ikar, and each had a special relationship with their on and off-screen handler, Halle Berry (via The Ringer).\nRELATED: John Wick Chapter 5 - If It's Happening, Possible Story & Everything We Know\nThey might not be John Wick's dogs, but Sofia's Belgian Shepherds steal the show in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. They pull off impressive stunts during the Casablanca shootout, but there wasn't an animal handler just off-camera or hiding in the scene. The Belgian Shepherds were basically Halle Berry's dogs. Following her casting as Sofia, Berry had a sit-down chat with the directors, in which they discussed how hands-on the role would be. Not only did she take on combat and weapons training regimes as vigorous as Reaves, but she also spent time training and bonding with the dogs (via The Ringer).\nDuring the filming of their big action set piece in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Halle Berry and the filmmakers only really had one problem keeping the dogs well-behaved. The scene was filmed in the North African country Morroco, an area in which stray cats roam in large numbers and care little for Hollywood film sets. According to John Wick 3's Halle Berry, the cats were, \"everywhere, and when my dogs saw cats they went ballistic.\" In an interview included on the film's Blu-ray, Berry goes on to explain that cats would stroll onto the set and the dogs would chase after them mid-scene, disrupting the filmmaking process.\nPractical stunt work is a big part of the John Wick franchise with the vast majority of what's seen achieved by actors and stuntmen. This extends to the John Wick dogs as well. In a podcast, director Chad Stahelski weighed in on the dogs. The director said, \"There's no such thing as a movie dog. It's just a dog doing his thing on set\" (via ReelBlend). As a result, some of the hardest scenes to film involved trained animals. \"When a dog attacks, it's actually trying to injure a person.\" When viewers see a dog attack a character, it's really going for the attack and is not acting.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, there is a stunt where one of Sofia's dogs leaps from her back and climbs up a second-story balcony. There was no CGI involved. The film's visual effects supervisor, Rob Nederhorst, pointed out on Twitter that all dog-related stunts were real, including the wall climb (via The Slate). \"The dog climbed up that wall. Our action team was incredible and I am honored to have worked with them.\" It's actually well within the realms of reality for a dog to clear a 5-foot jump with a running start or to scramble up a 15-foot wall, and that's without the added benefit of a Halle Berry leg-up.\nAndy, the animal actor who played the first John Wick dog, Daisy, was only eight months old when he took on the pivotal role in the 2014 movie. In that respect, it's not surprising that he wasn't the most well-trained of animal actors. In the opening scenes of the film, Andy is shown palling around the house with Keanu Reeves, but he often missed his mark. In fact, the only way to entice Andy into jumping onto John's bed and licking his face was to spread bacon grease on the actor's cheeks (via Pup Help).\nWhile the filmmakers loved to praise the stuntwork - humans and dogs alike - and practical effects, there was at least one area with CGI. Trainers point dogs in a direction, and the dogs do what their training calls for, but dogs are not actors. For many reasons, a dog cannot bite an actor in the crotch and do so practically and safely. In the third John Wick movie, the dogs were taught to play-attack the bad guys, but it needed to look real. CGI cones were placed over the stunt performer's crotches, so CGI could make the damage caused by the John Wick dogs look real in the end.\nWhile Mr. Nobody's dog in John Wick: Chapter 4 doesn't have a name and is only referred to in production notes as the \"faithful accomplice,\" Stahelski became extremely close with the dog, or the five dogs, that played the combat-loving canine (via AS). The director revealed, “Not only did I get acquainted with them, I worked to understand their energy and build a believable relationship.” Each of the five trained John Wick dogs had their own specific skill that the faithful accomplice showcases in the fourquel, as Stahelski added, “Each one had a different personality, energy, and skill set. One dog did the tugging, another fetched.”\nKieran has a Bachelor of Arts in Screenwriting and Film Studies, which he mostly uses as a conversation piece and professionally on occasion. In the past, he's written film reviews, short stories, scripts, and has acted as a script consultant.\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020. Since graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University with a bachelor's degree in Film, Television, and Cultural Studies in 2014, he has written for numerous movie and music websites.

Derrickson directed 2016's Doctor Strange, which introduced Benedict Cumberbatch's titular Master of the Mystic Arts to the MCU, and after the Phase 3 film's positive reception, Derrickson was expected to return for the much-anticipated sequel. However, despite a great deal of development on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness taking place, Derrickson stepped down in January 2020, replaced by Raimi, yet both Derrickson and Marvel Studios noted that they were thankful for their collaboration.\nSpeaking once again in an upcoming episode of The Playlist's The Discourse Podcast, Scott Derrickson reiterated that parting ways with Marvel Studios wasn't filled with animosity. He noted that there is \"no bad blood\" between him, Marvel Studios, and Sam Raimi, though mentioned that his vision for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Marvel Studios' vision didn't match. While Derrickson wanted the sequel to be an \"extreme departure from the first film,\" and \"a genuine horror film of sorts,\" Marvel Studios went in a more light-hearted direction, shedding more light on Elizabeth Olsen's corrupted Scarlet Witch as the villain. Read an excerpt from Derrickson's interview below:\nAll I can say is that what we said publicly is exactly the truth... We had real creative differences. You know, the movie I wanted to make and how I wanted to make it was different than–it was just increasingly obvious that we were pulling against each other. And that’s how you make a really bad movie, I think. When the producer or the studio and the filmmaker are making different movies, you end up with a monstrosity and, you know, that’s why I had to bounce... I went to the premiere. I’m still friends with Kevin [Feige] and everything with me and Marvel is really cool... They invited me to the premiere and I went. And I’m friends with Sam [Raimi]. I love Sam, so there’s no bad blood over that.\n ​​​​​​​\nConcept art from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness revealed details about Scott Derrickson's original plans, which would have focused on a different villain and provided more insight into Doctor Strange's backstory in the MCU. While Elizabeth Olsen had signed on to be involved in Multiverse of Madness prior to Derrickson's departure, the villain of the film would have been Nightmare, the ruler of Marvel Comics' Dream Dimension. After battling Dormammu, the ruler of the Dark Dimension, in 2016's Doctor Strange, Strange going toe-to-toe with Nightmare in the sequel would have been fantastic, though it seems Strange and the Scarlet Witch would have teamed up against the villain.\nThe original Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness would have also shown audiences Strange's sister, Donna's, tragic death in the Wendigo Forest in their childhood, which was mentioned in Raimi's version of the film. It was also reported that the multiverse would have been explored in far more detail, with Strange traveling to numerous new realities, expanding on the dark, otherworldly multiverse that was glimpsed throughout the first film. Sam Raimi's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was met with a mixed response, but Derrickson's gritty exploration of Strange's persona, and the MCU's multiverse as a whole, might have been more popular.\nSource: The Playlist\n"}

Created by Casper Kelly (Adult Swim), very Short Treks celebrates the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Animated Series. The five very Short Treks episodes, which are decidedly not part of Star Trek canon, are animated in Filmation's style from the 1970s, with some modern animation from Star Trek: Lower Decks and Star Trek: Prodigy worked in. Star Trek fans' reactions to very Short Treks ran the gamut from appreciation to disdain, but they also varied in accordance with each episode's release.\nPerhaps the biggest draw for Star Trek: very Short Treks is the all-star cast of current and legacy actors assembled to voice the various characters. Star Trek on Paramount+'s shows are represented by Ethan Peck as Mr. Spock, Doug Jones as Saru, Celia Rose Gooding as Uhura, Noël Wells as D'Vana Tendi, Bonnie Gordon as various roles, and Bruce Horak, who reprises the late Lieutenant Hemmer from Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Star Trek legacy actors who returned include George Takei as Mr. Sulu, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Armin Shimerman as Quark, Ethan Phillips as Neelix, and Connor Trinneer, who played Commander Trip Tucker for the first time since Star Trek: Enterprise ended in 2005. Here are the five episodes of Star Trek: very Short Treks ranked, worst to best:\nRelated: Star Trek's 5 New Shows Ranked, Worst To Best\nThe scatological \"Worst Contact\" is the low point of Star Trek: very Short Treks. The premise of the third comedic short involves Star Trek: The Next Generation's Commander Will Riker, Dr. Beverly Crusher, and an unnamed crewman from the USS Enterprise-D attempting to make First Contact. \"Worst Contact\" rapidly devolves into gross-out humor by the aliens who resemble the Talosians from the first Star Trek pilot, \"The Cage.\" There's not much to enjoy in \"Worst Contact\" besides hearing McFadden and Frakes play Dr. Crusher and Riker again (with Beverly calling Commander Riker \"Bill\").\nYou can watch \"Worst Contact\" here:\n\"Skin a Cat\" is an inauspicious debut for Star Trek: very Short Treks. Set aboard the USS Enterprise of Star Trek: The Animated Series, the short has some clever jokes involving turns of phrase that the increasingly strange alien crew members of the Enterprise take offense to. While Ethan Peck plays Mr. Spock in lieu of the late Leonard Nimoy, Pete Holmes plays a confused, generic starship Captain who doesn't seem to be James T. Kirk (thankfully). The oddball designs of some of the alien Enterprise crew are funny, but the overall experience of watching \"Skin a Cat\" leaves a lot to be desired.\nYou can watch \"Skin a Cat\" here:\nThe presence of a very much alive Lt. Hemmer, and Nyota Uhura wearing a Starfleet Cadet's uniform, confirms Star Trek: very Short Treks episode 2 is set during Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1. A holiday party aboard the Starship Enterprise turns awkward fast when Lt. Spock unveils a \"blooper reel\" where the jokes are thousands of horrific deaths in a nod to the series premiere of Star Trek: Discovery, crew members being maimed by transporter malfunctions, and Spock getting dumped by his Vulcan fiancée, T'Pring (Gia Sandhu). The gallows humor of Spock not understanding what a \"blooper\" is does come off as funny, and \"Holiday Party\" is a step up from \"Skin a Cat.\"\nYou can watch \"Holiday Party\" here:\nThe final Star Trek: very Short Treks episode ends the series on a musical high note. Going full meta, \"Walk, Don't Run\" is hosted by Star Trek: Lower Decks' Ensign D'Vana Tendi (prior to her season 4 promotion to Lieutenant, junior grade). Unfortunately, the upbeat Tendi runs afoul of Scotty (Carlos Alazraqui), who takes offense to some of the Orion's verbiage. But their arguments, which include an amusing debate about Star Trek: The Animated Series' rec room vs. Lower Decks' holodeck, are diffused by the arrival of Commander Riker and Mr. Sulu, who kick off a wacky musical number. Of course, the song in \"Walk, Don't Run\" can't compete with the quality of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' musical numbers, but Noël Wells' singing voice as Tendi shines in this homage to animated Star Trek combining the TAS and Lower Decks animation styles.\nYou can watch \"Walk, Don't Run\" here:\nAt a breakneck two minutes, \"Holograms All The Way Down\" is half the length of the other Star Trek: very Short Trek episodes, but it crams in over a dozen Star Trek characters and manages to be genuinely funny. Written by Star Trek: Prodigy executive producer Aaron J. Waltke, \"Holograms All The Way Down\" kicks off by returning to the Enterprise NX-01 with sly wink at Commander Trip Tucker's death in Star Trek: Enterprise's controversial series finale before it turns into a madcap holodeck adventure uniting characters from every Star Trek series, including Star Trek: Prodigy. \"Holograms All The Way Down\" even jokes about Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's classic \"In The Pale Moonlight\" as the holodeck plot spins toward a truly bizarre sight gag. \"Holograms All The Way Down\" is easily the best Star Trek: very Short Treks episode, and it's a loving ode to Star Trek overall.\nYou can watch \"Holograms All The Way Down\" here:\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}

These Tokens are essential, but at that point, there will be no easy way to find or locate Contracts and the game does not give any hint as to when these will become available. It is not until a certain quest becomes available that Basim can find and complete Contracts.\nDue to returning to stealth-favored mechanics in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, players will have to find ways to decrease their Notoriety and ask for favors from other characters. These are all connected in the game, and players might find themselves frustrated if they cannot find Contracts to earn the Khidmah Tokens. There is another way to do so, but finding Contracts is by far the easiest method.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nDuring the quest to find Ali ibn Muhammad, Basim will be tasked to regroup at the Bureau after freeing a group of rebels.

Once it is available, interact with the Contract Board at any Bureau location, and accept any number of Contracts you want. There will usually be around five Contracts available for Basim to accept if he has none selected.\nBasim can accept every single Contract on the Board if he so wishes, and this can allow for more choices when exploring the world. It will also allow you to see where on the map the Contract is and the level of the area it is located in. Players can view more details in the menu.\nTo fulfill a Contract, go to the Investigation screen in the menu, and select “Contracts.” There will be a list of all available Contracts that Basim has accepted, select the one you want to do, and travel to the point on the map. Accepted Contracts can be seen on the map of Baghdad as a pinwheel with a question mark in it.\nOnce Basim is close, he can use Enkidu to mark the exact location and from there complete it like you would any other quest. Optional objectives are tracked from the moment you enter the Quest area to the time you finish the Contract. You will not have to return to the Bureau, instead, Basim receives the rewards as soon as he has finished the job. New Contracts will become available at the Bureau when Basim finishes a Contract on his list, which all allow Basim to explore the city of Baghdad in Assassin's Creed: Mirage.\n"}

With theories abounding over how the X-Men will finally make a full appearance in the MCU timeline, there are many questions that need answering, including how the typical air of distrust between mutants and humans will be justified. It is a narratively messy plot point that even plagues the comics, as the difference between mutants and other super beings is often tenuous.\nUntil now, the humans of Earth that don't possess superpowers or galaxy-sized brains have very little reason to distrust their super-powered protectors. The Blip, the Battle of Earth, and many other humanity-saving feats have all but cemented the Avengers and their ilk as protectors of Earth and bona fide celebrities. Although the argument could be made that they entice the trouble they then defend against, the consensus seems to be that without the likes of the Avengers, humanity would be doomed. It surely stands to reason, then, that the mutants would be seen in the same way.\nRelated: Marvel's X-Men Movie: Everything We Know\nThe MCU's biggest challenge with regard to the X-Men now (aside from explaining away their absence over the last several years) is differentiating them from other super-powered beings that have won the hearts and minds of the general population. This could be done through the public vilification of the main villain in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Namor, the MCU's oldest mutant. Aside from inflicting a lot of damage to Wakanda itself, he and the Talokanil had grander designs: to take control of Earth with Wakanda's aid.\nNamor's bad relationship with humankind could be the springboard the MCU needs to stoke resentment against those who call themselves \"mutants.\" The term has not been thrown around too often in the MCU, leaving it wide open to being co-opted by just about anyone looking to besmirch the innocence of mutantkind. Namor could then be the perfect target of a smear campaign against any who would call themselves \"mutants,\" suggesting that any who do so ascribe to the same nefarious anti-human sentiments as Namor. Then all that's required is for Magneto to further widen the rift between mutants and humankind by giving credence to their fears.\nPart of the central themes of the X-Men lore is how they can be ostracized from society due to their unique set of gifts. This is, after all, the driving force behind Magneto and his team of \"bad guys,\" as many retaliate against the bigotry of human beings who consider themselves to be \"normal.\" The theme opens up a plethora of storytelling possibilities, sympathetic villains, and allegories that stand the test of time and help to make the X-Men as popular as it is today. As a group, the X-Men represent a safe haven for their kind, and their fight against those who consider mutants to be either inferior or superior to humans is central to their existence, and something the MCU will need to embrace.\nOllie discovered his love for all things nerdy very early on in life and has only gotten nerdier with age after only discovering the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in his 30s.

{"title": "Dave Filoni Is Completing The Massive Star Wars Story He Started 12 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The Ahsoka finale has set up the completion of a massive story arc Dave Filoni started 12 years ago, continuing it from animation to live-action.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nDave Filoni has re-introduced a massive Star Wars story in the Ahsoka finale that he first started 12 years ago, and it has huge implications for the future of the galaxy. The course of Ahsoka season 1 has drawn upon plenty of characters, moments, and other story threads that Filoni first debuted in animation, largely due to the fact that most of Ahsoka Tano's (Rosario Dawson) story has occurred in animation up to this point. Now, the finale of the Star Wars Disney+ TV show has tied the two mediums even more closely together.\nMuch of the interest and intrigue of Ahsoka season 1 lingered with Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll, and what power or entity the dark Jedi kept sensing on Peridea. He told his apprentice Shin Hati throughout the series that he heard it calling to him even before they made it to Peridea, and he described it as some kind of \"beginning\" - a way to end the cycle of Jedi versus Sith. It's now been revealed that it was the Mortis gods calling to him, and their origin goes all the way back to an animated Star Wars series.\nThe Mortis arc was a part of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, which saw Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan Kenobi all mysteriously stranded on the mystical planet with three Force-gods. This is how Ahsoka ended up being tied so closely to the Daughter, the Force-goddess who gave her life so that Ahsoka could live. The Mortis gods were also seen in Star Wars Rebels season 4, as they opened a gate for Ezra Bridger into the World Between Worlds. Now, 12 years after this The Clone Wars arc first premiered, Filoni is continuing its story.\nNot only is Baylan last seen standing on the hand of a statue of the Father, but Ahsoka is also visited by her convor Morai, the owl who's been connected to her ever since the Daughter sacrificed her life for Ahsoka's. The stone statue of the Daughter is also the only one on Peridea that's destroyed, as both the Father and the Son still remain standing. Many viewers have thought this could be pointing towards an introduction to Abeloth, the Mother who was overcome with darkness when she tried to gain the same immortal powers as her family.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nEither way, there's no doubt Filoni plans on completing his massive Star Wars story centered around Mortis in the near future. Ahsoka season 2 hasn't yet been confirmed, and even if it doesn't happen, this story could be told in Filoni's The Mandalorian-era movie. All roads for the future of Ahsoka are leading directly back to Mortis, and given its importance in The Clone Wars arc where it first debuted, what unfolds next with have a huge impact on the fate of the Star Wars galaxy.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are now streaming on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best PlayStyles in EA Sports FC 24", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "PlayStyles are the latest addition to Ultimate Team in EA Sports FC 24, giving specific boosts to the top stars reflecting their real life abilities. \nEA Sports FC 24 is here and the latest title in the series sees the introduction of PlayStyles to separate the very Elite footballers. Replacing the previous Traits system, PlayStyles-specific attributes have been given to the best players in EA Sports FC 24 to boost aspects of their play on the pitch. In addition, PlayStyles+ takes it to another level with certain players, such as Marcus Rashford with a Power Shot, receiving an even bigger boost, making these stars more valuable to players in Ultimate Team.\nCards in Ultimate Team can learn new PlayStyles by completing Evolutions, allowing you to tailor your own abilities to the best players if they don't automatically start with one. Combining this with the updated Chemistry system in EA Sports FC 24 gives you freedom when building a team. In total, there are 34 PlayStyles, all tied to certain aspects of play on the pitch, Scoring, Passing, Ball Control, Defending, Physical, and Goalkeeper. Here are the 10 best PlayStyles currently in EA Sports FC 24.\nRelated: EA Sports 24: Release Date, Editions, & Pre-Order Bonuses\nThere are lots of passing-based PlayStyles that midfielders can especially take advantage of, including Pinged Pass. It increases the speed at which passes travel to their target without making it harder for the receiver to control the ball. While the best passes of the ball can already do this, if they have this PlayStyle it can open up teams quicker. It also gives you opportunities to play longer balls, that would normally be intercepted with ease.\nThe dead ball PlayStyle does exactly what it says on the tin. While most players online tend to play the ball short from free-kicks around the edge of the box, it can be worth having a player with this trait in your team to have direct shots on goal.\nThe accuracy of free kicks and the line that is drawn on the screen showing the ball path are both increased, meaning if you know what you are doing you can score a high percentage of the time with them. While free-kicks do take practice, having a Dead Ball specialist can make the difference in tight games.\nSpeed has always been a key attribute across sports titles and those players with the Rapid attribute have an even greater increased speed. They are also able to keep control of the ball while dribbling at a higher speed. Top stars such as Kylian Mbappe have the Rapid PlayStyle and it will make them even harder to stop this year.\nCombining this with other PlayStyles has the potential to change a number of stars to become overpowered cards and the majority of those playing online will look to take advantage of this.\nThe Technical PlayStyle increases speed during Controlled Sprints and enables precise wide turns while dribbling. Dribbling is more effective in EA Sports FC 24 than in previous entries in the series, which makes the Technical PlayStyle even more powerful. Players such as Lionel Messi, who already excel at close-control dribbling, are now even harder to take the ball off.\nLast-second movements with the ball can give players that opening to pass or shoot and this PlayStyle will allow that.\nIn the late stages of matches, stamina plays a huge role, with players struggling to stay at top speeds the longer the game lasts. The Relentless PlayStyle reduces fatigue loss during the game and gives players more of a boost at half-time. A great option for those in the middle of the park, it can make a huge difference in the final ten minutes or in any games that go into extra time.\nInterceptions are a key part of football and can make a huge difference in matches on EA Sports FC 24. The PlayStyle increases the chance to intercept a ball, as well as the distance a ball can be intercepted. Players automatically intercept well in this year's game and this takes it to another level.\nHaving this on a defensive midfielder can pick off a lot of dangerous passes and in turn start a counter-attack quickly.\nSkill Stars have previously determined what special moves a player can make in the FIFA series. However, the new Trickster PlayStyle enables the execution of unique flick Skill Moves. For those who like to show off on the field including a player with this PlayStyle will open up new options and ways to beat defenders.\nLots of the top stars including Heroes and Legends available in EA Sports FC 24 have the Trickster ability, so for those who can afford them, they are worth it.\nWhile several of the best defensive players are already capable of blocking a lot of shots, those with the Block PlayStyle, such as Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk, have enhanced blocking range and an increased success rate of blocks. Like interceptions, a lot of this will be done automatically when defending, but those with the PlayStyle will feel impassively for the opposition. When using players with the Block ability, no extra action needs to be taken, but their presence when defending will be felt.\nFor a number of years, Finesse Shots have been overpowered in the FIFA series. On certain games in particular any shots from around the edge of the box would fly into the top corner. While this isn't the case with normal Finesse Shots in EA Sports FC 24, those with the PlayStyle attribute can score from a host of different positions and angles.\nChelsea's star striker Sam Kerr is one such player to have this PlayStyle and if you give her room to shoot outside the box it could easily end up in the top corner.\nWhile all of the PlayStyles have their uses, the Power Shot is the best and most effective. In the most important areas on the pitch, Power Shots can be extremely effective, but they take time and space to use. With this PlayStyle players will shoot faster, meaning defenders will have less time to react.\nPower Shots, if on target, are rarely saved by goalkeepers and this will allow you to get your shots off quicker in EA Sports FC 24.\nSimon is a Gaming Guides writer for ScreenRant focusing on FIFA and Pokemon.

Debuting in 2021, the Showtime original horror series follows the girls of the WHS Yellowjackets soccer team as their plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and have to resort to extreme measures to survive. The series also follows some of the girls 25 years later as they are still dealing with the fallout of their dark past. Endlessly creepy and brilliantly acted, Yellowjackets only got better in its second season, despite some very conspicuous changes to the main cast.\nThe character of Akilah is only featured in the flashback storyline, but her deft Girl Scouts abilities made her something of a team leader despite their obvious limitations. It hasn't been revealed what was the ultimate fate of Akilah in the Yellowjackets timeline, but it could be speculated that she didn't make it judging by the fact that she has not appeared in the present day. The role was originally played by Keeya King, a Canadian actor who gained acclaim for playing the role of Violet in the Syfy Channel series Van Helsing. Recasting on TV is common, but the sudden change was an odd departure for the creepy series.\nFans of Yellowjackets immediately noticed a change to the supporting cast of the series when Keeya King was replaced by Nia Sondaya in the role of Akilah for season 2. As previously stated, recasting is a common practice in TV, but the departure of King was never officially explained by those involved with the show. However, Sondaya proved herself to be just as capable in the role as she grew the character who teetered between sanity and madness as she found herself swept up in the frenzy of the other girls.\nAkilah in season 2 went from just a helpful rookie with a bit of Girl Scouts experience, to a full-fledged character as she became a follower in the group's eventual descent into cannibalism. The ending of Yellowjackets season 2 left Akilah in a fascinating position, and she will likely grow more when season 3 finally rolls around and the season might also reveal her final fate. As for King's departure, it could have simply been a matter of scheduling, since the talented young actor has been quite busy since she left the cast of Yellowjackets after season 1.\nRELATED: Yellowjackets Season 2 New Cast & Returning Character Guide\nA consummate show business workhorse, Keeya King has kept herself quite busy since leaving Yellowjackets, and she has seen the size of many of her roles increase since playing in the prestigious series. In 2022, King starred in the Tubi TV original thriller film Rush For Your Life where she played journalism student Tasha who goes undercover to expose the secrets of her college's sororities. In the same year, she played the small role of Nikki in the Bruce Willis-led geezer teaser action film, Detective Knight: Rogue.\nKing's final role in 2022 was a three-episode stint on the Canadian legal drama Diggstown, and she landed another film role in 2023 when she starred in Pride: Seven Deadly Sins, a TV movie. In the Lifetime original, King played the role of Ella, which once again allowed her to expand her horizons as a dramatic actor. While she has yet to star in a project that has rivaled Yellowjackets on its critical success since she departed, it's clear that Keeya King has no issues getting work.\nDalton is a freelance writer, novelist, and filmmaker from Orlando Florida.

With her power to rearrange the molecular structure of all matter, Atom Eve is one of most powerful heroes in any universe, something that is shown off to stunning effect in new cosplay honoring one of Invincible’s premiere superheroes.\nShared via Instagram by photographer Pat Loika, the photos depict cosplayer Kira Kelly mid-flight as Atom Eve.\nCreated by Robert Kirkman and Corey Walker, Eve’s classic superhero design is perfectly captured by Kelly's cosplay, with its bright, primary colors and a simplistic silhouette. Check out Loika and Kelly’s brilliant work below.\nRelated: Invincible's Last Line Redefines the Meaning of Omni-Man's \"Think, Mark!\" Speech\nRunning for 144 issues, Invincible was one of the most popular independent comics of the past several decades. The story of teenager Mark Grayson, son of the world's most famous superhero, featured the character following in the footsteps of his father Omni-Man, becoming the eponymous \"Invincible.\" Atom Eve is depicted throughout Invincible as Mark's one true love, a hero as formidably powerful himself, and a strong, capable love interest. Cosplayer Kira Kelly delightfully brings Eve to life, with some excellent Photoshop effects completing the effect, allowing Atom Eve to show off her matter manipulation powers with some swirling atom energy designs.\nInvincible was notable in how it followed its characters in real time, staying with Mark as he graduated from high school, went off to college, and eventually settled down and started a family with Atom Eve. In a world dominated by Marvel and DC, Invincible's ability to build its own universe of superheroes to stand alongside the Big Two was a remarkable achievement.The world of Invincible was filled with heroes and villains who felt iconic the way the best Marvel and DC characters do. There’s Atom Eve, of course, along with fellow heroes in the original Teen Team, like Robot, Dupli-Kate, Monster Girl and Atom Eve’s original boyfriend, Rex Splode.\nUnlike the Marvel and DC universes, these characters were able to grow and change in real time, making them feel like real people who were living actual lives on the page. This is one reason why Atom Eve and Invincible’s story resonates with so many readers, and why Kira Kelly's collaboration with Pat Loika, bringing to life a dynamic representation of Atom Eve, is one of the most engaging cosplays of the year. With Invincible having a second life thanks to its current Amazon Prime Video adaptation, the series' characters are still at the forefront of many fans memories, something Loika and Kelly's cosplay expertly taps into.\nSource: Pat Loika, Kira Kelly\n"}
{"title": "12 Most Iconic Disney Villain Songs, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "Whether they're sang by the villains themselves, their henchmen, or the heroes of the story, these iconic songs reveal Disney's darker side.\nThe most iconic Disney villain songs are a unique and captivating facet of the studio's musical legacy. These songs serve as a musical canvas for the darker and more complex characters in the Disney roster, allowing them to express their nefarious intentions with style and flair. These songs often encapsulate characters' motivations, fears, and aspirations, becoming integral to the overall narrative.\nAs proven by the best Disney songs of all time, the emotional depth conveyed through music allows audiences to more profoundly connect with the characters - even if they're extremely nefarious villains. Disney songs that reveal the villains' innermost desires convey just the right amount of context for adults - without crossing the line in movies made primarily for children. Both enthralling and disturbing, iconic Disney villain songs are a testament to the studio's ability to infuse even the darkest characters with a certain charm. In the musical world of Disney movies, even the most evil of villains have a chance to steal the spotlight with their wickedly enchanting melodies.\nRelated: 10 Animated Disney Movies With The Most Songs, Ranked\nThough The Jungle Book's King Louie isn't much of an antagonist, he's still technically a Disney villain, and his song is inarguably better than any other villainous tunes in the movie. Performed with lively flair, \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is a whimsical plea from the smooth-talking orangutan to Mowgli, expressing a desire to learn the secret of humanity's fire, in order to become more like humans.  \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is notable for its catchy beat, tune, and infectious rhythm with swing jazz elements, and King Louie's performance effortlessly captures the essence of fun and mischief prevalent throughout The Jungle Book.\nPerformed by the lovable bear Little John, one of the most likable members of the Robin Hood cast, \"The Phony King of England\" is a good old medieval hoedown. It isn't sang by a villain, but it's about the movie's main antagonist, the self-serving lion Prince John. A lively and humorous tune that explains the relationship between the common folk and their cowardly lion monarch, the song encapsulates the film's theme of standing up against injustice. \"The Phony King of England\" isn't that well-known compared to other iconic Disney villain songs, but it's quite a clever and well-disguised nod to folk protest songs in the real world.\nSang by the villainous Brom Bones, this song narrates the legend of the Headless Horseman, a ghostly rider seeking a replacement for his missing head in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. The eerie and ominous lyrics create a sense of foreboding and excitement, combined with a darkly melodic traditional pop tune that balances the themes. The song is also performed by the legendary Bing Crosby, who voices not just Brom, but also the narrator and Ichabod Crane in the movie. Largely underrated, both \"Headless Horseman\" and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad went on to inspire Disney's latter, more famous musical numbers.\n\"You're Only Second Rate\" from The Return of Jafar is performed by the charismatic antagonist Jafar himself. This song unfolds as Jafar, having returned in his quest for revenge, revels in his wickedness, malevolence, and magical prowess. In the signature style of the Aladdin franchise, the song combines Arabian influences with a Western orchestra, the perfect epic backdrop to a villain of Jafar's stature. Genie is on the unfortunate receiving end of \"You're Only Second Rate,\" and apart from the clever wordplay being funny and entertaining, it also underscores how easily Jafar can dominate Genie in a contest of magic - making the villain all the more frightening.\nRelated: Aladdin 2: The Return Of Jafar Is The Best Disney Sequel\nCruella de Vil doesn't sing her eponymous song in 101 Dalmatians. Instead, video game designer Roger comes up with \"Cruella de Vil\" on the spot at home, as his wife Anita's boss Cruella comes over for a visit. While trying to come up with the lyrics for a jazzy melody, Roger gets inspired by Cruella's impending presence, resulting in a darkly humorous and smooth tune that uses Cruella's own name as its catchy hook. With Roger's voice, the rhythm of the song is hypnotic, and serves as the perfect introduction to one of the most evil, memorable, and complete villains in Disney history.\nRelated: All 101 Dalmatian & Cruella Movies Ranked, Worst To Best\n\"Mine, Mine, Mine\" from Pocahontas is a bold and brassy musical number that epitomizes the greedy ambitions of Governor Ratcliffe. In this song, Ratcliffe expresses his desire for gold and riches as they embark on a journey to the New World - and even betrays Ratcliffe's true intentions of somehow claiming the British throne. The upbeat tempo and triumphant orchestration highlight Ratcliffe's imperialistic mindset and unchecked avarice, contrasting sharply with the film's themes of harmony and understanding. The lyrics emphasize the conquering mentality of the colonial expedition, echoing the historical narratives on which the film is based.\n\"Be Prepared\" from The Lion King is secretly one of the darkest moments hidden in a '90s children's movie. With Scar explaining his evil and meticulous plans while assembling his army, \"Be Prepared\" is an epic war anthem that illustrates Scar's cunning nature and the impending threat he poses to the Pride Lands. What's even darker is that the song was inspired by The Lion King artist Jorgen Klubein sketching Scar as Adolf Hitler. After seeing this sketch, the directors where inspired to use scenes from the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will in order to give chilling life to the marching scenes in \"Be Prepared.\"\nWith its New Orleans jazz-inspired vocals and riffs, \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" set a new high standard for catchy Disney tunes - while also being perfectly suited to giving the villainous Oogie Boogie his most crucial moment in the film. One of the best songs from The Nightmare Before Christmas, \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" is an aptly soulful gem sang by the eponymous boogeyman of Halloween Town. The song is a lively, swing-inspired piece with dark undertones, blending whimsy and malevolence seamlessly, just like Oogie Boogie himself. The epitome of macabre and charming, this tune deserves the praises it has garnered over the years.\n\"Gaston\" from Beauty and the Beast is a boisterous and humorous musical number that serves as an ode to the film's primary antagonist, Gaston. Performed by Gaston himself and his fawning sidekick LeFou, the song celebrates Gaston's egoistic and testosterone-driven prowess. The upbeat and lively tune, accompanied by a tavern full of enthusiastic townsfolk, creates a jovial atmosphere that contrasts with the film's more somber moments. The lyrics humorously highlight Gaston's exaggerated self-confidence and how he's idolized by the locals, hinting at an antihero underneath the comically arrogant figure. Contextualized with the plot of Beauty and the Beast, \"Gaston\" highlights the eponymous villain's underappreciated complexity.\nRelated: 10 Disney Villains Who Were Almost Heroes\n\"Hellfire\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a dark and haunting masterpiece that briefly but deeply dives into themes of lust and obsession. In a raw reveal of the character's most turbulent inner conflicts, Frollo's powerful vocals convey a sense of torment as he grapples with his forbidden desires for Esmeralda. The intense orchestration, chilling lyrics, and overall stark dramatic flair perfectly capture Frollo's struggle with its own sense of morality. \"Hellfire\" stands as a unique Disney song, pushing boundaries and exploring darker aspects, showcasing the versatility of the studio's musical repertoire.\nThe Princess and the Frog's \"Friends on the Other Side\" is sang by Dr. Facilier, arguably the most underrated Disney villain of all time. Dr. Facilier uses the catchy jazz-inspired tune to revel in his role - as an intermediary between the world of the living and the dead. From parlor tricks to actual glimpses into the other side, Dr. Facilier wows the naive and selfish Prince Naveen - and corners him into making a deal. After \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" raised the standard for soulfal jazz in Disney musical numbers, Dr. Facilier's \"Friends on the Other Side\" answered the call with this smooth, sultry, and cajun-flavored ode to voodoo.\n\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid is a spellbinding showcase of villainy sung by the sea witch Ursula. The song begins with Ursula telling Ariel about how she uses her powers to help the unfortunate - but it ends in Ursula's Faustian bargain to transform Ariel into a human in exchange for her voice. The sultry melody, coupled with Ursula's tongue-twisting verses and clever wordplay, captures the character's cunning nature. One of the most iconic Disney villain songs of all time, \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" is a haunting anthem about making a deal with the devil - but from the devil's abyssal point of view.\n"}
{"title": "One Small Baldur's Gate 3 Decision Makes The Battle At Last Light Inn So Much Easier", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The battle at Last Light Inn can be a challenging obstacle in Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3, but it's possible to smooth things over with one choice.\nThe battle at Last Light Inn can be a challenging and even frustrating encounter in Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3, but it doesn't have to be. As a deep, choice-driven roleplaying game, Baldur's Gate 3 is all about offering multiple approaches to overcoming the hurdles that it presents throughout the story. Some enemies can be defeated through persuasion rather than battlefield prowess, and certain encounters may never even arise depending on the decisions made beforehand. The ability to choose the order in which the party does many tasks can also be a great way to dodge certain complications that only arise with specific sequencing.\nLast Light Inn is a rare beacon of safety in the Shadow-Cursed Lands of Baldur's Gate 3, but the battle that occurs there threatens that sanctified nature. The Selûnite cleric Isobel provides the protection for the inn through the power of her goddess, and when the Flaming Fist traitor Marcus comes to take her away, the inn will lose that protection entirely. Avoiding this outcome in the battle requires the party to keep Isobel on her feet, a task that can be tricky given her inclination toward exposing herself to danger.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Should You Save Isobel Or Side With Marcus At The Last Light Inn?\nIt seems counter-intuitive to suggest avoiding a story encounter in Baldur's Gate 3, but when it comes to the Last Light Inn, it can actually be a viable plan. Marcus' arrival at the inn is a planned cutscene moment rather than a background activity in the world, meaning that the party has to initiate a conversation with Isobel for it to ever occur. Going about other Act 2 business instead of rushing to converse with the cleric has the odd side effect of actually protecting the inn rather than bringing it under threat.\nTaking this approach doesn't mean that the Last Light Inn has to be avoided entirely, as Isobel doesn't lurk the common area waiting to spring a cutscene upon the party. It's fully possible to explore everything else to do in the Last Light Inn before venturing out into the rest of the Shadow-Cursed Lands, as initiating the conversation with Isobel requires entering her room and approaching the porch where she performs a ritual. Although some conversational triggers in Baldur's Gate 3 are easy to initiate by accident, this isn't one of them.\nThe story of Baldur's Gate 3 makes it seem imperative to speak with Isobel, as the Shadow-Cursed Lands feature an oppressive darkness that can easily sap health from the party. Isobel, however, isn't the be-all and end-all for curing this issue. The blessing she gives the party will remove them of their need to use generic light sources like spells or torches for the moderately dangerous areas of the shadow curse, but it doesn't protect against the areas where the problem is deepest, rendering it convenient but unnecessary as a navigational tool.\nThe Moon Lantern is the actual key object for protection against the deepest areas of the shadow curse, and this can be safely acquired without Isobel's involvement. Although certain triggers can induce her to offer it to the party, it can also be acquired by venturing out with the Harpers to defeat a patrol that carries a functional Moon Lantern. This is a manageable fight that doesn't make protecting NPCs either particularly difficult or strictly necessary, so it poses little in the way of an obstacle to comfortable exploration of Baldur's Gate 3 Act 2.\nRelated: How To Get (& Fix) The Moonlantern In Baldur's Gate 3\nThe biggest concern with skipping out on the initial conversation with Isobel at the Last Light Inn would be the amount of Baldur's Gate 3 story content that could be lost by the decision, as ignoring NPCs can sometimes lead to parties missing intriguing side narratives. This method does obviously require the sacrifice of the initial key scene with Isobel, but it doesn't cut off any significant moments later in the story. The party can safely speak with her after carrying out an important mission in the Shadowfell, resulting in a different interaction that would otherwise be missed and putting the story back on the same track.\nThe consequences for this choice come back to haunt Marcus rather than Isobel, resulting in his apparent death at the hands of Ketheric Thorm in Baldur's Gate 3. When it comes to the climactic battles and story beats of Act 2, everything will ultimately sync up with the path of saving Isobel in combat while avoiding the potential risks that the battle can incur. It's undeniably the safest way to ensure that the Last Light Inn doesn't fall in Act 2, making it a reasonable option for anyone who wants to protect everyone while avoiding reloads.\nRelated: Should You Enter The Shadowfell Before Moonrise Towers In Baldur's Gate 3?\nDespite all the advantages of not talking to Isobel, it's ultimately just a surprisingly effective alternative rather than a definitive way to play through Act 2. The main downside to this method is the loss of potential XP from the Last Light battle, which could make later encounters a bit more challenging if it prevented a timely level up. It also doesn't feel quite as seamless in the story, as Act 2 is clearly written around the expectation that parties will speak to Isobel first. The later dialogue option is a nice contingency plan that shows consideration for a different order, but its more of a bandage than anything.\nUltimately, there's no wrong way to approach the story at the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3, as any technique can lead to interesting outcomes. For parties unwilling to risk the lives of the inn's inhabitants, however, talking to Isobel is the most dangerous decision to make. Various patches have made the inn fight less of a struggle than it was at launch, but no method of protecting the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3 is as surefire as leaving Isobel to her own devices.\n"}

And then, towards the end of the premiere episode, titled \"This Took Too Long,\" it's revealed that Ben has been missing and presumed dead for three years.\nIn an interview with TV Insider, executive producer Chris Grismer confirms the three-year decision came from the writers room.

Their quotes are below:\nGRISMER: “[It] came from the writers’ room. I think it was a great way for us to not have to sit in all the fallout from the original story and just sort of get ahead to the meat of what’s going on. I really liked that it wasn’t three years for him and to watch that contrast, that struggle between two people experiencing time differently.”\nPRATT: “The big question is, what happened to everybody in those three years? The fact that Ben has no recollection of three years passing is a true — I could go nerd out on you and talk Einstein’s theories of time-space continuums, but the reality is he now has to deal with everybody else’s life went on. Where is Addison? What is she dealing with? That mourning and that loss or the belief of that loss and how she kept herself together and the fact that she now has to face somebody that she thought was gone forever is a huge journey for not just Addison, [but also] for Ian, Magic, and Jenn because suddenly they have a chance to bring him home.”\nRelated: Quantum Leap Season 1 Ending & Time Travel Twists Explained (In Detail)\nThe premiere episode saves the clarification on Ben's twist until the last moment. After successfully completing the objective behind his leap, Ian finds Ben. The emotion of their reunion is short-lived, as Ben has all sorts of questions. Ben observes that Ian looks different and is wearing a forlorn expression. With hesitance, Ian shares the reality of the situation: It's been three years. Ben is thought to be dead. The Quantum Leap project is shut down.\nBefore Ben can even process the information, he's sent away on another leap as the NBC reboot balances its weekly stories with the larger overall arc. But in terms of that overall arc, Ben now has a closer connection to Scott Bakula’s Sam Beckett. The updated series has been focused on figuring out what happened to Beckett, who also vanished in the original series. Ben will presumably now learn for himself what that experience can be like.\nThere's also the question of how the new characters will impact the story. There's Hannah Carson, played by The 100 alum Eliza Taylor, a complex woman \"who is more than she appears to be.\" Quantum Leap season 2 trailers reveal that Hannah knows about Ben's secret, which could suggest that the three-year gap has a lasting impact on the team. It could be the case that they'll struggle to get close again.\nSource: TV Insider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

It is focused on committing crimes, which can alienate companions but also leads to great rewards.\nThe Crimson fleet is one of the many factions in Starfield. They are a criminal organization operating out of the Kryx system. Joining them will require breaking the law, stealing, and other dubious actions.\nInitially, you must join the Crimson Fleet as an undercover spy for the UC Sysdef. However, as the story progresses you can choose to become truly loyal and betray your UC Sysdef handlers. This is a stand-alone questline and does not interfere with joining any other faction.\nThe Crimson Fleet will not invite you directly. Instead, you must first commit some type of crime within the United Colonies space and get caught. This could include theft, smuggling, assault, trespassing, or murder. Upon being arrested, you will be sent to meet with Commander Ikande, who will brief you on the job for the quest Deep Cover.\nYou will be sent to the planet Cydonia to meet with Saorise Bowden. You can either bribe her for information or refuse and be imprisoned. The latter will lead to you receiving an anonymous letter with the same details. Either option will eventually lead to the Broken Spear to speak with Alder Kemp.\nYour next task is to go and wrangle out money from Karl Fielding. Either persuasion or combat will convince him to hand over the cash. Report back to Alder and he’ll explain that you may now meet with the starship Astraea in the Europa system. This will give you an audience with Naeva, who will have a short request to kill Austin Rake on board the Ragana.\nGo to the Enceladus system and board Ragana. Locate Austin and either execute him or convince the captain to do it for you. Upon successful completion, talk to Naeva again and she will send you to The Keys to meet Delgado and join the Crimson Fleet, proper.\nDuring this whole time, UC Sysdef will keep hounding you to relay back info about the Crimson Fleet’s operations. This will cumulate in the mission Legacy’s End. There is the option to side with either the Crimson Fleet or UC Sysdef for the remainder of the game’s story. To truly be part of Crimson Fleet, head to The Key and agree to ship Kryx’s Legacy to the faction.\nRelated: Best Starfield Companions\nThis is a rather evil act, and many companions will disagree with the choice. However, staying with the Crimson Fleet will also recruit Mathis Castillo to your side. You also get several exclusive rewards, including taking part in the Crimson Fleet’s mission board for side quests. But, you also lose out on some of the best weapons, including the option of looting Delgado’s personal gear.\nTo play things safe, consider making a separate save at the beginning of Legacy’s End. If you become unsatisfied with the Crimson Fleet, you will always have the option of reloading and making another choice. This can even include not resolving the quest at all, leading to having access to both factions for the remainder of Starfield. You can also simply wait until New Game Plus to take the other route and view both outcomes.\nKurtis Seid has been covering the game industry for over a decade.

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage Map Size: How Big Is AC Mirage?", "date": "2023-10-05 11:00:26", "text": "Assassin's Creed Mirage returns to the franchise's roots with a smaller title set in a stunning recreation of 9th-century Baghdad.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has been a return to the franchise's roots, with a smaller, more stealth-focused title set in a stunning recreation of Baghdad in the year 861. The title tells the origin of Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character who was introduced in the franchise's last title, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, by which time he was already a Master Assassin on his travels to Norway​​​​​.\nAssasin's Creed Mirage's story brings the series back by returning to the Middle East. Many years before Altair's story in the first Assassin's Creed, which took place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land (modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Syria), a 17-year-old Basim worked alongside his mentor, Roshan. He would go on to grow from being a common street thief in Baghdad to a fully-fledged member of the Hidden Ones by taking down members of The Order of the Ancients.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nAssassin's Creed Mirage's developers compared the game's map to previous entries in the long-running series during 2023's Summer Game Fest. During this interview, Ubisoft stated that Assassin's Creed Mirage's depiction of Baghdad would be similar in scale to Constantinople in 2011's Assassin's Creed Revelations and Paris in 2014's Assassin's Creed Unity. However, these maps varied quite significantly in size. The Constantinople map was 0.94 km², whereas Assassin's Creed Unity took advantage of the improved hardware available with the release of the PS4 and Xbox One and offered a hugely detailed Paris map more than twice as large at 2.40 km².\nThis comparison was presumably intended to point out a difference between the scale of Assassin's Creed Mirage and the massive maps of the franchise's last three mainline entries, Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. After years of the franchise using a similar formula with annual releases, Ubisoft opted to change the direction of the series by adding more ARPG elements and showcasing huge open-world maps consisting of parts of Egypt, Greece, Norway, and England. Valhalla's total map size came in at over 99.7 km², which is a far cry from the likes of Revelations and Unity.\nWhile this change has received praise from many, there are members of the Assassin's Creed fandom who have complained that these games feel too large for their own good and would rather see the series return to its roots. Fortunately, Ubisoft seems to be catering to both parts of the fanbase with smaller, stealth-heavy titles like Assassin's Creed Mirage and larger ARPG titles like the upcoming Japan-based Assassin's Creed: Codename Red in the coming years.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nAssassin's Creed Mirage's Baghdad map will be around 2.30 km², which is nearer to the size of Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris than Assassin's Creed Revelations' Constantinople. Previously, images of the game's physical copies — some of which included a physical map — revealed that players could visit the surrounding areas outside the city, such as the Abbasiyah, Harbiyah, and Karkh districts, and Alamut. The latter of which should be familiar to long-term fans of the franchise as a major stronghold of the Hidden Ones and Assassins.\nThis led YouTuber DG VFX to make calculations using gameplay footage objective markers. According to these calculations, Assassin's Creed Mirage's total map size is 45 km², with the playable area being 13 km². This makes the game larger than both of the titles Ubisoft previously compared it to, but fortunately, much smaller and more manageable than entries such as Odyssey or Valhalla​​​​.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nWhile the Assassin's Creed series does have its mythical and fantasy elements, it has also been known for its incredibly detailed reconstructions of real-world locations. The most famous example was when Assassin's Creed Unity's depiction of Notre Dame was used to assist in rebuilding the real Paris landmark after a structural fire in April 2019. Ubisoft and its team of designers, artists, and historians who had spent years researching and recreating the cathedral and offered its 3D model to the French government and other organizations involved in the effort. The company also pledged to donate half a million Euros to help with the restoration and encouraged fans to donate as well.\nTherefore, it should come as no surprise that Assassin's Creed Mirage's depiction of Baghdad is following this trend. Assassin's Creed Mirage's Art Director, Jean-Luc Sala — who has a personal connection to the location, having grown up on the other side of the Tigris River from Baghdad in Iran before moving when he was 11 — had previously spoken on the challenge of recreating a 9th-century version of the Iraqi capital with Gamesradar+.\nThe main challenges stemmed from the fact that Baghdad during that time was technically a lost city after being burned down by the Mongols in the 13th Century. Therefore, little is known about the location in that era, and historians actually wished the team at Ubisoft Bordeaux luck with their recreation, warning them that the lack of information would be \"problematic.\"\nThis didn't deter the team, however, who continued to work with historians and scholars around the globe to piece together as much knowledge as they could from archeology and references in literature to recreate the location as faithfully as possible. Sala stated, \"It's not 100% accurate, but this is the best it can show,\" and explained that historians can now use the game's 3D model to talk more about the subject.\nAccording to Sala, Dr. Ali A. Olomi, the esteemed historian of the Middle East and Islamic history, was \"like a kid\" when Ubisoft showed him around Assassin's Creed Mirage's recreation of Baghdad. Olomi had spent his life studying that period and that city, and therefore, Sala stated that it was an incredibly \"emotional\" experience for both the professor and the developers, showing that Ubisoft's hard work and dedication had truly paid off.\nTherefore, while Assassin's Creed Mirage's map may be smaller than other games in the series, it has plenty for players to explore. With the game taking place during what historians have referred to as the Golden Age of Islam, it should also offer a unique experience for those wishing to visit a previously unseen version of Baghdad and its surrounding areas via Basim's story and one that's extremely different from most modern depictions of the Middle East.\nSource: DG VFX/YouTube, Gamesradar+\n"}

Dittos don't appear like most Pokémon. In fact, when you're out walking, you won't see a single Ditto. Dittos disguise themselves as a different set of Pokémon every month. If you're lucky, one of these Pokémon will transform into a Ditto after capture.\nShiny Dittos are even rarer than their regular counterparts. If you catch a shiny Pokémon, it is guaranteed to not be a Ditto. Shiny Dittos have the same disguises as regular Dittos. The shiny spawn rates for a Ditto are about equal to those of rare spawns. There are eight different Pokémon that could secretly be Ditto.\nDitto's disguises are spread between generations 1 through 6, with two Pokémon in Generation 1 and two in Generation 5. Nintendo last updated Ditto's disguise list during the March 2023 Let's GO/Team GO Rocket Takeover. Each copy behaves under the same rules as a real Pokémon of its type, despite being a Ditto.\nThe two Generation 1 Pokémon that Ditto likes to disguise itself as are Diglett and Grimer. As Generation 1 Pokémon, both of these are common in the wild and easy to track. Diglett is the safer bet of the pair, as it loves to spawn in wide-open spaces. This makes it easy for more players to catch Digletts and maybe find their first Ditto.\nSnubbull represents Generation 2 in the disguise line-up and is the only Fairy-type Pokémon on the list. Snubbull's followed up by Generation 3's Corphish, who got an upgrade in September 2023. Corphish now has Razor Shell in its move collection. If bulldogs and crabs aren't your style, you can look for a Starly, Ditto's Generation 4 disguise.\nRoggenrola and Tympole are both Generation 5 Pokémon and more disguise options for Ditto. Roggenrola is usually stronger than Tympole, so if you want to farm one of these two, Roggenrola would be more worthwhile to collect, just in case you find one you'd like to add to your permanent collection. The last character Ditto can turn into in Pokémon GO is Litleo, the humble lion from Generation 6. Litleo is an excellent pick for any Pokémon master building a team off of cuteness due to its big eyes and feline appearance.\nIf you want to increase your chances of finding a Ditto in Pokémon GO, keep an eye on your Nearby tab. If you find one of these eight Pokémon on the list, hurry to their location as quickly as you can. It may take a while, but if you focus your catching efforts on these Pokémon, you may find a Ditto sooner than you think.\n"}

Whatever your reason, whether it's to assist you in a difficult part of the game, unlock certain endings, or outfit your V with the best gear, console commands can make it happen. The possibilities of what you can accomplish with console commands are practically limitless.\nOn the other hand, console commands aren't always about acquiring the best Cyberpunk 2077 weapons, Cyberware, and vehicles or unlocking every possible ending. Sometimes, they're used as a quality-of-life mod. For example, removing the encumbrance on V so that you can spam pick up useless items to your heart's content. Even if console commands aren't your cup of tea, everyone can benefit from them in Cyberpunk 2077.\nRelated: Cyberpunk 2077: Ranking Every Possible Ending From Worst To Best\nAlthough update 2.0 brought many improvements and modifications to Cyberpunk 2077, a console command window was not one of them. As a result, you will need to install the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod by Yamashi to use console commands and cheats in the game. The mod itself has been updated to support Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. And, once downloaded, it's as simple as pressing the Tilda key (~) in-game to open the console commands menu.\nYou can use the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod for other applications, such as a UI, to configure other mods, set up hotkeys, and turn on/off certain game settings you would not otherwise have access to.\nUnfortunately, it's limited to PC players because you must download Cyber Engine Tweaks to access console commands. In other words, Xbox and PlayStation users cannot access or use console commands in Cyberpunk 2077.\nAlthough console commands have many applications in Cyberpunk 2077, most players immediately gravitate toward cheats. Cheats are commands that change your character's performance, such as adding unfathomable amounts of health, money, or XP to them. Here are some of the best console commands and cheats using the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod - though it's merely scratching the surface.\nConsole Command\nWhat It Does\nGame.AddToInventory(\"items.money\", 100000)\nAdds 100,000 Credits into your pocket.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"Health\", \"100\")\nAdds health points to V.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"Armor\", \"100\")\nAdds armor points to V.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"CarryCapacity\", \"100\")\nIncreased V's max carrying capacity.\nGame.InfiniteStamina(true)\nGrants V infinite stamina.\nGame.SetLevel(“Level”, x)\nLet's you change V's in-game level.\nGame.SetLevel(\"StreetCred\",x,1)\nLet's you change V's Street Cred level.\nvs = Game.GetVehicleSystem ()\nOpens the command to allow players to unlock every vehicle in the game.\nvs:EnableAllPlayerVehicles()\nThe player unlocks all the vehicles in the game.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.QuickHackLegendaryMaterial1\", 10000\nAdds 10,000 Tier 5 Quickhack Components to V's inventory.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.CWCapacityPermaReward_Legendary\")\nInstalls a legendary Cyberware Capacity Shard.\nGame.PrevSys_off()\nTurns off getting wanted by the police.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.PerkPointSkillbook\")\nGrants V one perk point.\nAny console command that ends with a numerical value can be modified. For instance - Game.AddToInventory(\"items.money\", 100000) - that 100,000 can be changed to 200,000, 300,000, and so on. Furthermore, if a command ends with an \"X,\" it means you must include your own numerical value of what you want, such as Game.SetLevel(\"Level\", x).\nAlthough these are some of the best console commands and cheats from the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod, it's not nearly all of them. In fact, there are thousands of commands and cheats at your disposal with this mod, all of which can be found online.\nYou can find commands and cheats on that list for practically everything. There are commands for acquiring every weapon, such as the best Katanas. Alternatively, acquiring certain pieces of clothing, such as David's Jacket in Cyberpunk 2077.

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage: How To Decrease Notoriety", "date": "2023-10-05 09:30:25", "text": "Basim’s Notoriety in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage can land him in big trouble, so decreasing it as soon as possible is a necessary evil.\nIn Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, Basim’s Notoriety will change the way you are able to play the game, and it is essential to learn how to decrease that notoriety early. With a high Notoriety, Basim will be easily spotted throughout Baghdad and unable to avoid guards who are furtively searching for him. Fortunately, there are several ways players can decrease Basim's Notoriety throughout the game and ensure he stays unnoticed.\nAssassin’s Creed: Mirage takes place slightly before the last entry in the series, Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, expanding on the story of Basim to explore how he got from street thief to the Hidden One. This entry in the series is much more focused on stealth like many of the earlier games, and being seen doing something illegal will instantly increase your Notoriety. Players should note that engaging in open combat will increase Basim's Notoriety immediately.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nThere are four levels of Notoriety in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage that will affect how Basim can travel through the city of Baghdad. Starting at the first level, Wanted Posters will appear throughout the city, and some civilians and guards may notice Basim. At level two, guards will likely find you and start patrolling rooftops, and more civilians will recognize you. At the final level, the elite Shakiriyya guard will begin following you, and civilians will regularly notice you.\nBasim should rely much more on stealth mechanics in Assassin's Creed: Mirage to complete missions, as completing tasks without being seen will not raise his Notoriety. However, there are several points in the game, including very early on, where Basim will be forced to do something in the open, or you will accidentally murder someone in front of a civilian you did not know was there. Luckily, there are two main ways to decrease your Notoriety.\nIf you start to get spotted, run for it and hide until things have calmed down. The Notoriety bar fills up incrementally, so disengaging and letting things calm down could keep the bar from reaching the next level.\nThe first and perhaps easiest method to decrease Notoriety is to remove Wanted Posters. They will appear on the bar at the top of the screen when Basim is near one, and Basim can approach and interact with the poster to remove it from the city. However, this can be risky when many civilians or guards are nearby, as getting caught removing it by a guard will not decrease your Notoriety. When Basim's Notoriety is high, Wanted Posters will almost always appear near Basim on Assassin's Creed: Mirage's map.\nThe second main way is to use a Power Token to bribe a Munadi. Power Tokens can be acquired through quests or pickpocketing, and Munadi can often be found standing on a platform in the middle of busy areas. Approach one and offer them a Power Token to spread false rumors about you, and Basim’s Notoriety will decrease immediately. This can be done anytime in Assassin's Creed: Mirage, even in the middle of quests, so take advantage of it if you can.\n"}
{"title": "The Best Cleric Multiclass Build In Baldur’s Gate 3", "date": "2023-10-05 09:00:27", "text": "Playing a multiclass hero in Baldur’s Gate 3 can be beneficial, but you need to know how to build them. Here are the best Cleric multiclasses so far.\nUsing a Cleric Multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3 is an excellent way of optimizing your character’s potential as a divine damage dealer or a team supporter. Multiclassing is a feature available in Larian Studio’s popular turn-based RPG that essentially allows you to undertake two distinct classes and level them up with a single character. Doing so will open up your list of potential skills, thus giving you completely different approaches to the game. Using some of the best Multiclass combinations allows you to expand your character’s range of abilities, making them a more skilled healer or perhaps a more versatile DPS.\nUsing Multiclasses, however, is optional. They can provide benefits if you are thinking of optimizing the character’s build for a specific archetype that fits a well-rounded party composition. Alternatively, it can also become a mess of stats thrown around, where a character can do many different things but doing all these things rather poorly. As such, players should be using the best Multiclasses available, and part of doing so is using the Cleric as a base, as one of the best classes in Baldur’s Gate 3 – even if it is one of the least popular ones.\nRelated: 5 Best Multiclass Combinations In Baldur's Gate 3\nThe Cleric and Paladin Multiclass combination may be one of the most traditional ones that stem from Dungeons and Dragons, and, once again, it proves its value in Baldur’s Gate 3. Mixing these two classes will allow you to transform your character into an envoy of holy powers, not only dealing a lot of damage but also healing and protecting yourself and your teammates. With the Cleric’s healing and buffing powers, you can make yourself even stronger when jumping into the heat of the battle to start smiting opponents, as Paladins often do.\nCleric & Paladin Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\nAt least 6\nPaladin Level\nAt least 2\nBest Abilities\n \nA fun and devastating strategy is to use the Cleric’s Spirit Guardians and head over to a group of enemies to start beating them up with the Paladin’s various smite abilities. In addition to this, Paladins can also use Bonus Actions starting at level, which allow them to strike twice. This can also be used against bosses like Ketheric Thorm in Baldur’s Gate 3. Because Clerics rely heavily on Wisdom and Paladins often depend on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, finding the sweet spot can be tricky.\nUltimately, it comes down to your desire to mold them into an offensive light powerhouse or a more support-focused tank with excellent offensive capabilities. Either one works well, as the Cleric and Paladin Multiclass stands as one of the best Multiclasses in the game. Even a stealthier approach with a combat focus on debuffs against enemies can be achieved through a Trickery Domain Cleric and Oathbreaker Paladin Multiclass. In terms of roleplaying campaigns in Baldur’s Gate 3, the Cleric and Paladin Multiclass may be one of the best to use, as Clerics’ and Paladins’ proficiency with the holy light makes for a perfect match.\nIf your approach to the playable character is proper support for the rest of the team, then one of the best possible combinations is a Cleric and Bard multiclass build. This special mash-up will give you healing and protective abilities from Cleric in Baldur’s Gate 3, but the Bard will be the one doing the shining in terms of buffs. In fact, it is recommended for the Domain of Life Cleric to be leveled only a little bit so that you can unlock the essential skills, giving room for the Bard to develop more.\nCleric & Bard Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\nAt least 3\nBard Level\nAt least 7\nBest Abilities\n \nThe main focus of this build will be upgrading your buffing capabilities, which comes at the expense of your offensive powers. That is not to say you will be completely useless in terms of damage output, but this Cleric and Bard Multiclass hero will not be the spearhead of the party. On the other hand, it may be the most important piece of a team composition in Baldur’s Gate 3, as the Cleric Bard mix will protect allies consistently while empowering the main damage dealer to wreck opponents. An additional advantage of this build is applying the occasional debuff to enemies.\nRelated: Baldur’s Gate 3 Classes Are Going To Save Your Campaign From Disaster\nAnother positive aspect of this Cleric and Bard Multiclass build is that the stat spread is much more organized than the one with Cleric and Paladin, which has the risk of going all over the place. With a Cleric Bard in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to invest in Charisma and Wisdom. This will, in turn, also allow you to take on the role of the persuasive and deceitful negotiator, capable of talking your way out of most situations, should you have that option. Characters that deal damage tend to steal the spotlight, but this Multiclass mix is second to no DPS.\nIf you want one of the most overpowered Multiclass builds in Baldur’s Gate 3, mixing Cleric and Sorcerer is the solution. Not only are these two of the best classes in the RPG, but they are also complementary to one another. While Cleric will thrive with protective abilities and an occasional buff, the Sorcerer will wreak havoc with its elemental abilities across the arena. This Multiclass is not as tanky as the Paladin Cleric, which can endure many rounds of incoming damage, but it is one of the finest DPS builds available.\nCleric & Sorcerer Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\n5\nSorcerer Level\n7\nBest Abilities\n \nThe Sorcerer alone is already an S-tier class to choose from with its Lightning-based abilities, but mixed with a class that protects itself like the Cleric; you get a master magic user. In addition, both use the same types of weapons and armor, so there is no need to unlock proficiency with heavy armor or certain weapons, for instance. Like the Cleric Bard Multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to invest in Charisma and Wisdom, as the Cleric will play a less important role than the Sorcerer for damage purposes. Nevertheless, this is much more balanced.\nYou will need to increase Cleric to a fairly high level, even if the Sorcerer class is to be the priority. If you focus your character into a Tempest Domain Cleric with a Storm Sorcerer, you may as well be invincible – you even get the ability to fly. This is one of the most broken DPS builds, but a pleasure to play with. Regardless of whether you are looking for more damage output or support capabilities, the Cleric is a great class to use in Multiclass builds for Baldur’s Gate 3.\n"}

According to the YouTube creator Minecraft & Chill, other landmarks like an Outpost and Village found in a nearby tundra are places you may also loot for helpful gear.\nVillages, Outposts, and Temples are essential places to travel to during a good Survival run of Minecraft, making this seed popular by including all three early on. Spawning in this world puts you on the sands of a beach next to a Jungle biome with four Temples hidden inside the dense forest. A nearby Village, both in the forest and in the close desert, should give you everything you need to get started very quickly in your adventure.\nThere are a few Witch Hut structures within the Jungle biome of this seed as well, but some dangerous mobs guard them. You may want to get some protection against them before trying to loot their homes.\nOne of the biggest challenges with Survival seeds with tons of biomes is the sheer amount of time it takes to travel to each important location. Thankfully, this world provides an easy solution to this problem, with a vast river connecting almost every Minecraft environment. In addition, a Shipwreck and an interesting collection of Cherry Blossom trees inside an enclosed icy mountain give you some advantages to work with when you spawn.\n\"Warm\" biomes like Deserts, Badlands, and Jungles are all present here, with several Temples in each region to explore to your heart's content. Three of these spaces also give you access to Strongholds underground, which are perfect for those in Survival mode who eventually want to take on the Ender Dragon. There are so many Ruins, Villages, and even a hidden Igloo base in Minecraft that will keep you busy for a long time.\nThis seed has every Overworld biome within just over 1,000 blocks right when you spawn, creating a shockingly even distribution of environments. A large Badlands biome is located next to a large ocean that connects all these places with every type of aquatic biome. Even the incredibly rare Lush Cave biome is seen underneath a large ravine, allowing you to harvest almost every known material in Minecraft.\nThis seed has the greatest potential in Survival mode because of the presence of every biome in the game at equal distances from the island you spawn on. Anyone who will be dedicating a lot of their time to a Minecraft world should be able to visit various unique places to keep the experience fresh. All you need is a boat to go anywhere you could imagine in this limitless seed.\nThe best seeds for Survival in Minecraft provide the resources your character needs to live and a wide variety of places to go that make your adventure constantly exciting through discoveries.\nSource: Minecraft & Chill/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Our Flag Means Death Season 2 Episodes 1-3 Recap: 13 Biggest Moments", "date": "2023-10-05 07:01:28", "text": "The pining gentleman pirate Stede Bonnet and a heartbroken Ed \"Blackbeard\" Teach return in Our Flag Means Death season 2's three-episode premiere.\nSpoilers ahead for the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death season 2.\nThe three-episode Our Flag Means Death season 2 premiere on Max is packed with all the humor, heartbreak, and high-seas misadventures that made the first installment such a hit in 2022. In Our Flag Means Death season 1, gentleman-turned-pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) renounced his family's wealth and aristocratic title for a life of piracy. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for Stede, who found himself falling for the once-ruthless Captain Blackbeard, a.k.a. Ed Teach (Taika Waititi), against his better judgment. At the end of Our Flag is Death season 1, Stede fakes his death to return to Ed and their pirate life.\nUnlike Stede, though, Ed isn't taking their sudden separation well. Consumed by heartbreak, he ignores his duties as captain of the Revenge, inciting anger from his first mate — and notorious Stede hater — Izzy Hands (Con O'Neill). After being accused of going soft, Ed tosses one of his own overboard to flex his power, dumps all of Stede's belongings overboard, and strands the gentleman pirate's crew on a deserted island. Little does Ed know, Stede is dead-set on being reunited, which is right where Our Flag Means Death season 2 picks up.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Our Flag Means Death Season 3\nHaving officially renounced his wealth and recovered most of his crew, Stede is trying to make his way in the pirate world. In the Our Flag Means Death season 2 premiere, he pens a message in a bottle to Ed, narrating the ups and downs of his misadventures. Mostly, things have been challenging, though Stede tries to put a positive spin on it all: \"We're in a rebuilding phase as a crew,\" he writes. But what's really driving Stede is his love for Ed and his desire to find the wayward captain. \"To reiterate, we’re doing great,\" Stede narrates. \"I think of you, often.\"\nWhile Stede is turning his heartbreak and hardship into action, Ed isn't handling the separation so well. Instead of being driven by purpose, he's compelled by his off-the-handle emotions and reverts back to his Kraken persona. \"I’m the f***in’ devil,\" Ed announces in true Blackbeard fashion as his crew murders an at-sea wedding party just for kicks. Even to Ed's crew, the violence seems uncharacteristically hollow and aimless, making Blackbeard and Stede's awkward breakup all the more troubling.\nRelated: Who Is Anne Bonny? Minnie Driver's Our Flag Means Death Season 2 Character Explained\nIn Our Flag Means Death season 2, episode 1, \"Impossible Birds,\" Stede and his crew find themselves without many options. Hoping to save enough for a proper ship, they broker a deal with Spanish Jackie (Leslie Jones), a much-feared pirate bar owner who boasts 19 husbands, working for her at the Republic of Pirates. After Stede's crew tries to rob Spanish Jackie of her chest full of precious indigo, they find themselves in a tight spot until the local soup kiosk owner, Zheng Yi Sao (Ruibo Qian), saves them.\nZheng Yi Sao reveals herself to be a revered pirate queen and takes Stede and his comrades about her ship, the Red Flag. Earlier in the episode, the faux soup server explains that she prizes action over ambition, which becomes a running theme for the season. Generally speaking, the captain of the Red Flag doesn't take men aboard her vessel but makes an exception for Stede's crew of \"tender as hell\" guys. At first, that seems like a life-altering favor, but things grow more complicated on the pirate queen's ship.\nAfter Izzy encourages them to dump loads of loot from the Revenge just so they can plunder more, Blackbeard's crew starts to speak up about what's happening aboard the ship. \"We think you’re in an unhealthy relationship with Blackbeard,\" Jim (Vico Ortiz) tells Izzy. But that's not the only friction point. As a heartbroken, angry Blackbeard creates an increasingly \"toxic atmosphere,\" the crew isn't just worried about Izzy, but themselves too. Unfortunately, things don't go well when they voice these concerns.\nIn season 1 of Our Flag Means Death, Izzy had accused Ed of being a \"shell\" of his former self after the once-ruthless captain continually hesitated to kill Stede. Outwardly, Ed has tried to project strength and rehabilitate his soft image, though that's caused him to backslide and take things too far. The friction between Izzy and Ed is still very much there, so when Ed draws his pistol on the crew during the workplace meeting, the first mate has no problem telling Ed that what's ruined him is, \"You’re feelings for Steve f***in’ Bonnet.\" Without a second thought, Ed shoots Izzy.\nRELATED:  10 Memes That Perfectly Sum Up Our Flag Means Death\nWhile aboard the Red Flag, Stede and his crew meet the only other man the pirate queen ever took aboard: Lucius (Nathan Foad). Formerly Stede's scribe and the lover of Black Pete (Matthew Maher), Lucius is somewhat glad to be reunited with his former crew, but the events of the Our Flag is Death season 1 finale loom large. In fact, pushing Lucius overboard was one of the heartbroken Ed's first acts that was meant to prove his still-callous nature. At first, Lucius hides the truth, but after Stede fixates on finding Ed, Lucius points out that Blackbeard might not be the person Stede wants him to be.\nAfter Ed shoots Izzy, he makes Frenchie (Joel Fry) his new first mate. Unwilling to be the next one in the line of fire, he tries to talk down his credentials. But the ever-unhinged, heartbroken Ed demands the appointment and Frenchie has no choice but to accept. His first act as Ed's new right-hand man is to finish off Izzy, but Frenchie and the crew decide to secretly stow Izzy below deck instead. Meanwhile, aboard the Red Flag, Zheng Yi Sao's first mate dubs Nathaniel Buttons (Ewen Bremner) a \"sea witch.\" Perhaps just a funny reference to the pirate's ability to commune with seagulls, it could point toward a future season 2 plot point.\nGiven Frenchie's inability to lie well, Ed deduces that his former first mate is still alive and on the Revenge. Below deck, Jim amputates Izzy's wounded leg just before Ed discovers them. After handing Izzy his pistol and telling him to finish himself off, Ed decides to blow off some steam. He steers the Revenge directly into a raging storm and then shatters the wheel. Still not satisfied, he forces his crew to fight each other and threatens to fire a cannon at the mast, in the hopes of killing everyone on board. Breakups really are rough.\nUnable to tolerate their captain's barbaric behavior any longer, the crew of the Revenge take matters into their own hands and fight back. After knocking Ed to the ground, Jim raises a cannonball high into the air — seemingly to crush Ed's skull. However, the camera cuts away, leaving Ed's fate up in the air. When the battered Revenge washes up beside the Red Flag, the pirate queen's first mate suspects mutiny and suggests they kill Izzy, Frenchie, Jim, and the rest of Ed's crew.\nRELATED: Our Flag Means Death Season 3 Confirmed To End The Show (But That Depends On 1 Factor)\nBack at the Republic of Pirates, Zheng Yi Sao falls for the ever-level-headed Oluwande Boodhari (Samson Kayo), as he and Stede were regulars at the soup kiosk. Previously, Oluwande was romantically linked to Jim, who, in turn, gets involved with Madeleine Sami's pirate character —nothing says romance like amputating a leg together. When Oluwande and Jim reunite during Our Flag Means Death season 2, episode 3, \"The Innkeeper,\" it's clear their connection remains, further complicating Oluwande's budding relationship with the pirate queen.\nWhen it becomes clear that Zheng Yi Sao is going to heed her first mate's advice and kill the remainder of Ed's crew, Stede takes matters into his own hands and devises a clever escape plan. Not only does he bust out the rest of the crew, but he manages to get everyone safely aboard the Revenge. To ensure the pirate queen doesn't pursue them, Stede's crew steals the wheel of her ship. While the escape may be glorious, Stede has clearly made a powerful enemy.\nEarlier in the third episode, Ed washes ashore on a seemingly deserted island. This somewhat tracks with what Izzy and the others say when they're accused of mutiny, claiming they just marooned a \"retired\" Ed. However, Ed's unconscious body lies below deck while his mind and spirit go on a journey of self-discovery. As it turns out, the island is Ed's version of purgatory. There, he meets his mentor, the late Captain Ben Hornigold (Mark Mitchinson).\n\"You’re afraid you’re unlovable,\" the purgatory Hornigold tells Ed when he can't decide whether to return to the world of the living or accept his demise. This ties into Ed's history with his own father, whom he killed, as well as why he took the breakup with Stede so hard. When Ed says he hates Hornigold, the ex-pirate captain points out that he's just a projection of Ed's inner turmoil, pushing Ed to have the hard realization that he actually hates himself.\nAs Ed has his moment of self-discovery in purgatory, Stede finds his body and begs him to come back. In his vision, Hornigold ties a rock to Ed and pushes him off a cliff. Struggling to surface with all that weight dragging him down, Ed thinks about giving in to what's heaviest. But when he hears Stede's voice, Ed fights to return to the light. Unfortunately, episode 3 cuts to the credits after Ed opens his eyes. Can Blackbeard and Stede find their way in Our Flag Means Death season 2? If the sure-to-be emotional reunion is any indication, it seems the two pirates might be fated for each other.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

{"title": "True Story Of Zheng Yi Sao, The Pirate Queen In Our Flag Means Death", "date": "2023-10-05 07:01:28", "text": "Dubbed one of the most successful pirates in history, Zheng Yi Sao is the latest iconic figure to appear in the series Our Flag Means Death.\nSpoilers ahead for the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death season 2.\nIn season 2, Our Flag Means Death wastes no time introducing Zheng Yi Sao, a pirate queen with an incredible true story that puts the tale of Blackbeard to shame. Of course, the series is accustomed to pulling figures from the pages of history. Created by David Jenkins, the swashbuckling, period rom-com focuses on gentleman-turned-pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby), who renounces his family fortune in favor of misadventures on the high seas. Soon enough, the captain of the Revenge meets one of history's most notorious pirates: Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi).\nWhile Blackbeard, a.k.a. Ed Teach, and Stede are the couple at the series' center, other real-life pirates populate the first 10-episode season of Our Flag Means Death. Most memorably, Will Arnett plays Calico Jack, an old friend of Blackbeard's who encourages the captain to give in to his most reckless impulses. A handful of new additions to the cast were announced ahead of the season 2 premiere: the sophomore outing of Our Flag Means Death has Minnie Driver's Anne Bonny join the crew as well as Ruibo Qian's Chinese pirate queen, Zheng Yi Sao.\nRelated: Where You've Seen Frenchie From Our Flag Means Death\nDuring China's Qing Dynasty, Zheng Yi Sao made a name for herself, becoming one of the most successful pirates in history. A former sex worker, Zheng Yi Sao was known to be a formidable businessperson, which attracted the attention of the pirate Cheng I, who lorded over the Red Flag Fleet. After marrying Cheng, Zheng Yi Sao became immersed in the world of piracy. Even though one of the names history knows her by, Ching Shih, simply means \"Cheng's widow,\" her piratical legacy is even greater, as Our Flag Means Death season 2 suggests.\nWhen her husband died, Zheng Yi Sao stepped in to lead Cheng's fleet, cleverly outmaneuvering his heir apparent and lover, Cheung Po Tsai. According to Atlas Obscura, she commanded a staggering 1,800 ships and 80,000 men — numbers that make Blackbeard's four ships and 300 men pale in comparison. To keep the Red Flag Fleet unified, the pirate queen implemented a strict code of laws, vowing to behead those who broke the oaths. Even with the East India Company, Chinese, and Portuguese fleets on her case, Zheng Yi Sao remained undefeated and, eventually, retired from a life of pillaging in exchange for amnesty (via Google Arts & Culture).\nWhile it's not known if the showrunners have mapped out Zheng Yi Sao's story into Our Flag Means Death season 3, it is clear that the pirate queen will play a crucial role in the second season. Zheng Yi Sao is most well-remembered for commanding a massive fleet. In the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death's sophomore season, the Red Flag fleet amounts to just a few ships. Given Stede and his crew's betrayal of Zheng Yi Sao, they've made an enemy of the formidable captain, which means it's likely that she'll return with the full force of her infamous fleet.\nWhile the series isn't set in the South China Sea, Our Flag Means Death keeps what's known about Zheng Yi Sao's disposition intact, as she's portrayed as a confident leader and skilled negotiator. However, there are some embellishments: the Our Flag Means Death season 2 villain runs her vessel by relying on the principles of unity, cohesion, and balance. Moreover, in the series Zheng Yi Sao's crew is made up almost entirely of women, which wasn't the case in real life. Regardless of the changes the show makes, Our Flag Means Death stays true to Zheng Yi Sao's spirit, further cementing her legacy as one of history's most accomplished pirates.\nSources: Atlas Obscura, Google Arts & Culture\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

With only 6 chances to get the right answer, players may need a little help.\nWordle is a simple word-guessing game that tasks players with solving a five-word puzzle using letter position clues. Wordle presents the player with six rows of five empty boxes. Simply enter a random five-letter word and the website highlights certain letters in green if they are correct, yellow if they are correct but in the wrong spot, or grey if they are not in the word at all. With this information, players need to try to figure out the word within the six guesses to be successful.\nThese types of guessing games have been around for a long time. One of the originals was called Mastermind, where players are tasked with guessing a row of colored pegs that utilizes the same hint systems found in Wordle. If players would like to try the game for themselves, it can be found on the Wordle website, which creates a new puzzle every day, keeps track of players' win streaks and guess distribution, and has a popular sharing ability.\nComedian Patton Oswalt scored a Wordle win-in-two, even though he only got a single misplaced letter from his starting word. He shared his win from July 15th on Twitter and called it \"Lucky!\"\nWith a new Wordle added every day, players may need a little help with the more difficult words, and having a strong starting word is important. Players may not have time to work out the puzzle solution every day, or perhaps they just want to keep their streak going but are having too much difficulty with the daily word.

{"title": "Wonka Receives Family-Friendly MPAA Rating, But There's A Unique Twist", "date": "2023-10-05 03:27:25", "text": "Wonka's MPAA rating has finally been released, revealing that the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel features some surprising violent moments.\nWonka's MPAA rating has finally been released, and while it isn't too surprising, there's a little twist. The prequel to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chcolate Factory was directed by Paddington's Paul King and features an all-star cast including Timothée Chalamet, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Keegan-Michael Key, and Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa. In Wonka, a younger Willy Wonka sets out to make his name as a world-class chocolatier in a rags-to-riches tale.\nWith Wonka's December 15 release date drawing closer, FilmRatings.com has unveiled the MPAA's official rating. While it has expectedly earned the family-friendly PG rating similar to the Gene Wilder-led Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the reasons for prequel movie's rating are somewhat surprising. The MPAA awarded Wonka a PG rating due to \"violence, mild language, and some thematic elements.\"\nWhile Wonka's rating could raise brows, its reasons aren't out of the ordinary for previous adaptations of the Dahl novel, which each had their own challenging elements. Despite its G rating, the first 1971 adaptation features moments where Charlie is threatened by the seemingly sinister Slugworth, Charlie and Grandpa Joe narrowly escape razor-sharp blades, and Wonka takes everyone through a terrifying tunnel. Meanwhile, Burton's quirky scenes, mild language, and heightened action in the 2005 adaptation saw that movie being given a PG rating like Wonka.\nFor Wonka, the noted violence could be due to it having clear, definitive villains as opposed to abstract concepts and archetypical characters. Willy will have to make his name for himself while avoiding the wrath of the \"Chocolate Cartel,\" an alliance of greedy chocolatiers consisting of Paterson Joseph's Slugworth, Mathew Baynton's Fickelgruber, and Matt Lucas' Prodnose. While the Wonka trailer reveals them confronting Willy in public, they have also been seen trapping him beneath a glass floor while the room fills with liquid chocolate, teasing their dangerous methods.\nWhile it remains to be seen just how Willy and the Chocolate Cartel will come to blows, Wonka's trailers hint that Chalamet's chocolatier will have to quite literally be quick on his feet to not suffer their wrath. Though the movie is being presented as a whimsical musical, the stakes could become quite high. Nevertheless, while some moments may be intense, they won't stop Wonka from maintaining a family-friendly tone.\nSource: FilmRatings.com\n"}
{"title": "All 3 One Chicago Shows Re-Open Writers Rooms Following WGA Strike Ending", "date": "2023-10-05 02:32:23", "text": "All three One Chicago shows - Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., and Chicago Med - re-open their writers' rooms following the WGA strike's conclusion.\nAll three shows within the One Chicago franchise have officially re-opened their writers' rooms following the end of the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) strike. The WGA's 148-day strike ended on September 27 after the writers negotiated a fair new deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). While much of Hollywood is still on pause due to the ongoing Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) strike, some aspects of production are resuming, particularly when it comes to writing.\nAs reported by Deadline, the writers' rooms for the One Chicago shows have re-opened following the end of the WGA strike. This means Chicago Fire season 12, Chicago P.D. season 11, and Chicago Med season 9 have all resumed writing and are one step closer to returning to the air. In addition to the One Chicago shows, NBC’s Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU and CBS' three FBI dramas are also resuming writers' rooms this week.\nPreviously, the One Chicago shows always premiered new episodes during the fall TV season. However, it has been quite clear for a while that the shows won't make their usual release dates this year. Even though the writing is back on, the SAG-AFTRA strike will prevent filming from getting underway. Still, despite the uncertainty around the SAG-AFTRA strike, industry insiders had a relatively optimistic outlook on the shows' returns.\nInsiders estimated Chicago Fire and its spinoffs' returns in the days leading up to the WGA securing a deal with the AMPTP. While they acknowledged that many factors could impact the timeline, they correctly predicted that writers' rooms would be open by early October. From there, they predicted One Chicago shows could be released as early as March 2024. This might sound fairly speedy, but production on procedural dramas like the One Chicago shows tends to be pretty swift. Plus, with speculation that the SAG-AFTRA strike will resolve soon, it's possible that the shows could make a spring 2024 return.\nHowever, it's important to remember that it's still unknown for sure when the SAG-AFTRA strike will end. Negotiations recently resumed, and the end of the WGA's strike is expected to pressure the AMPTP to also strike a fair deal with the actors. Still, without a confirmed end in sight, negotiations may take longer than expected. Plus, the shows must film enough episodes to keep up with weekly releases once everything is running again. Hence, while a March 2024 release date seems possible for One Chicago shows, it remains to be seen if they can make it.\nSource: Deadline\n"}
{"title": "Jamie Lee Curtis' One Piece Season 2 Casting Talks Will Happen, Insists Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-05 01:28:21", "text": "One Piece showrunner Matt Owens offers a positive update for Jamie Lee Curtis' campaign to play the character Kureha in season 2 of the show.\nOne Piece showrunner Matt Owens has offered a positive update on Jamie Lee Curtis' campaign to play Kureha in season 2. Kureha first appears in the manga's Drum Island Arc as a reclusive doctor the Straw Hats go to in order to help a sick Nami. Curtis will campaign to play Kureha after the Hollywood actors strike is over, as she herself is a fan of the franchise and wants to be involved in its live-action adaptation.\nSpeaking with Deadline, Owens revealed the team behind One Piece season 2 wants Curtis to portray Kureha. He revealed that, while the actors strike is preventing any negotiations from happening right now, there are plans to talk with Curtis about having a role in the show. Check out what Owens had to say below:\nWe have opportunities to stunt cast some roles, some rules that are very important, and it came out that Jamie Lee Curtis is a One Piece fan. As soon as she said that, we were like, okay, we have to try and get her on the show. What can we do? And Doctor Kureha, very luckily, is a character who is coming up in our story, and is someone who is perfect for Jamie Lee Curtis.\nSo we tried to start manifesting this dream of ours. After she won her Oscar, the writers room sent her a figure of Doctor Kureha with a nice note that said, 'Congratulations on your statue, here’s another one to put next to it. Hope to speak to you soon.'\nWhen she reposted that, it got a lot of fan interest, and I commented on it. We’re trying to manifest it. Yes, as of right now, SAG is still striking so there have not been real conversations. But as soon as there can be, I’m ready. I will take her out to dinner, we’ll talk about it. We’ll do all of it because at this point we’re writing for her — we really, really want her to come and play with us in Season 2.\nCurtis announced she wanted to play Kureha in late September, reposting fan art of herself as the doctor in her signature outfit. Since both Curtis and Owens are interested in her hopping aboard for season 2, it wouldn't be surprising if she's cast soon after the actors strike ends. Not only would this reveal how far the story of One Piece season 2 will take the Straw Hats, but it would also guarantee a fitting actor for the role of Kureha.\nBeyond saving Nami, Kureha also introduces the crew to Chopper, a mysterious reindeer who can turn himself into different forms after eating a Devil Fruit. Chopper is trained in medicine just as much as Kureha, prompting Luffy to ask him to join the Straw Hats as their doctor. Because of this, Kureha plays a significant role in the story beyond her primary purpose, making an acclaimed actor like Curtis the perfect casting choice.\nThe fact that Curtis may join the One Piece live-action cast in season 2 also reveals the next season will cover at least up through the Drum Island Arc of the Arabasta Saga. However, since the season will likely focus on the Straw Hats' journey to Arabasta like in the manga, the show may go beyond Drum Island. However much of the manga the next season covers, it appears Curtis will be part of bringing it into live-action form.\nSource: Deadline\n"}

The Masked Singer season 10 again features host Nick Cannon and panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. During the season premiere, Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse, which was one of the biggest unmaskings in the show's history.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features some fantastic costumes including Diver, Gazelle, S'More, Rubber Ducky, and Cow, who competed in the first competition episode. Rubber Ducky was revealed to be Anthony Anderson. He was replaced by the Wild Card contestant, Pickle, on NFL Night. Also singing in the show's milestone season will be Anteater, Candelabra, Cuddle Monster, Donut, Hawk, Hibiscus, Husky, Royal Hen, Sea Monster, and Tiki. Here are the clues and identity guesses for Diver.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nDuring The Masked Singer season 10 premiere, Diver gave a clue about himself stating, \"Usually I'm pretty pumped, but lately I've been lost in the abyss. I might be the most hated creature in the ocean right now. Usually you can find me under the sea, but, for this clue, you'll have to look to the sky.\" The clue was a picture of a cardinal.\nWhen Diver came out on stage to perform, Robin commented that he was tall. Diver sang a rousing rendition of \"Any Way You Want It\" by Journey, with much of the song being sung in a high pitch. His clue package began with him stating, \"Diving into a completely different persona feels like a nice escape.\" Diver then held up a newspaper called The Masked Singer Post with a headline that read, \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\"\nDiver confessed, \"I've been everyone's favorite person to hate, and, to be honest, I get it.\" An hourglass with sand pouring out of the bottom then appeared on the screen. He continued, \"I'm the first to admit, I've made mistakes. But, honestly, I did it for love.\" Diver went on to admit, \"It hurts when I get judged by people who never even met me, and I become a scapegoat for every bad dude they've ever known.\" A knight's shiny armor was then shown on the screen.\nDiver then shared, \"But I'm hoping all that will melt away when I hit the stage. Getting to share my voice without the preconceived notion of who I am is really what I need right now.\" Diver then held a compass that pointed to the Midwest. \"So tonight, I'm really getting my head in the game because I'm not ready to go back to the real world just yet.\"\nAfter Diver's performance, another clue was revealed. It was a magazine cover that said, \"Masked Money Money Money.\" The headlines read, \"Diver Opens Another Business!\" and \"11 Million Eyes on Diver!\" Diver explained, \"The more people talk about my business, the more I want 'em out of it.\"\nRelated: How The Masked Singer Season 10’s Anonymouse’s Clues Related To Demi Lovato\nOn NFL Night, Diver sang \"I Ain't Worried\" by OneRepublic. He once again showcased his high vocal register, and also performed a full dance routine. He interacted with the audience, and really got the crowd going. In Diver's clue package, he shared, \"Making my debut as the Diver last week was so rewarding. It felt great to get all the love from the panel and audience: something, as you know, I haven't gotten much of lately.\"\nDiver went on to reveal, \"As a kid, I always wanted to be famous. I modeled, I acted, and, of course, sang. I was always waiting to become a household name. I just didn't know it would be for everyone hating me.\" Diver was then shown watching his Masked Singer performance on a screen.\nDiver continued, \"But I'm here to show the world that I'm more than my mistakes. Being here already feels like a healing experience.\" A pair of red high heel pumps then floated across the screen. Diver said, \"Getting to share my talent, instead of my drama, is exactly what I've needed.\" He declared, \"So, tonight, I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball 'cause I am not ready to take off this mask.\"\nAfter Diver's performance, a superfan in the audience revealed another clue about Diver. He had a black club painted on his chest. Diver explained, \"I'm well-suited for the club. I know how to get the club going! What's up!\"\nAfter Diver's first performance, the panelists had some very varied ideas about who he might be. Nicole guessed that he might be Adam Levine, while Ken declared that Diver could only be Tom Sandoval. Fans on social media agree with his guess. Jenny believed that Diver might be Scott Disick. Based on the clues, Diver seems to be someone from the Midwest, possibly St. Louis, Missouri, because of the cardinal, which is the city's major league baseball team.\nOn NFL Night, Nicole guessed that Diver might be Pete Davidson, while Ken continued to insist that Diver was Tom Sandoval. Robin thought Diver might be Pauly D from Jersey Shore. For their final guesses, Robin stuck with Pauly D, and Nicole agreed with him. However, Ken had his second correct guess of the season, with Jenny agreeing. Diver ended up being Tom Sandoval.\nTom's clues led to Vanderpump Rules, including the premiere night \"pumped\" clue and the red high heel pumps. Tom is from St. Louis, which is why there was a cardinal and Midwest clue. Tom is a singer, who is currently in a band called Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras, which explains the \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It\" clue, in addition to him making headlines.\nAll of the clues about being hated refer to Scandoval, in which Tom was revealed to have been cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with one of Ariana's best friends, Raquel Leviss. Because of Scandoval, Vanderpump Rules season 10 had 11.4 viewers, which explains the number in his premiere night clue.\nPerhaps The Masked Singer can be Tom's redemption story, as he proved that there's more to him than his mistakes. With his impressive vocals and energetic dance moves, he showed off his talents. However, a deep dive into Tom's past may cause some to feel that he has a lot to make up for after cheating on Ariana. Fans will see more of him as he currently stars on Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test season 2. Whatever happens next, as Diver, Tom dove headfirst into The Masked Singer season 10 and gave fans two fun and impressive performances.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}

The retro pink refrigerator had a magnet that said, \"Welcome to fantastic Las Vegas.\" Cow continued, \"I won Grammys, traveled the world. I made hit after hit after hit. I guess you could say, I was kinda my own cash cow.

He wasn't really around, and I didn't have a lot of positive male role models growing up.\" The camera then panned to a pair of red boxing gloves with a gold down arrow on one of them.\nCow continued, \"I was raised in a house of all women, who made me the sensitive Cow that I am.\" Cow then looked at a picture of himself as a child, posing with a grown-up Cow wearing a hat that resembles Mickey Mouse's Sorcerer's Apprentice hat. Cow also revealed that he's a father. He said, \"Now, as a parent, I know the value of being present for my children. I've always achieved a lot of success in my life, but my greatest accomplishment has always been my kids.\"\nCow was shown with three young cows. There was a piece of paper with a red heart drawn in crayon, along with crayons scattered on the paper. He shared, \"It's so easy to get overwhelmed by the smoke and mirrors of fame, but I told myself early on that I am a family cow first. So when I get on that stage, I'll be thinking of them and treasuring every single moment.\"\nAfter Cow's performance, The Masked Singer season 8 contestant Le'Veon Bell (Milkshake), brought out another clue. It was a pair of black tap shoes, carried out in a giant purple bowl with a gold star on it. Cow explained, \"Much like a Super Bowl Half Time show, I am known for my killer moooo-ves.\" He then showed off some of his dance moves.\nRelated: The Masked Singer: Gazelle Identity Prediction & Clues\nAfter Cow's first performance, Jenny guessed Shawn Stockman from Boyz II Men because he has a biopic coming out, and the group has had a Las Vegas residency and won a lot of Grammys.

Jenny thought Gazelle might be Riverdale actress Camila Mendes, while Robin guessed that she was Lucy Hale. Nicole theorized that Vanessa Hudgens might be under Gazelle's mask. Although many fans on social media have been guessing that Gazelle is Carrie Underwood, the clue about her crashing and burning during a national talent competition seems to have ruled her out, since Carrie won American Idol season 4.\nDuring NFL Night, Jenny used the villain clue to guess Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester. However, Ken thought she might be Constance Wu. He got choked up when he made the guess because Constance is a dear friend of his, and Gazelle's voice moved him. Nicole thought that, because Gazelle spoke about not fitting in with the herd and had a surfboard and Hawaiian shirt clues, she might be Auliʻi Cravalho, the voice of Moana in Disney's animated feature film, Moana.\nGazelle's dazzling performance got her through to the next round, in which there will be even more clues as to who she is. Based on Gazelle's incredible vocals in her first performance, Jenny predicted that she would make it to the finals.

S'More added, \"I thought it was the end of the road, but I was still hungry for a new journey. So that's why I'm here to conquer the Masked Singer stage. This S'More's gonna make you melt.\"\nAfter S'More's performance, another clue was revealed to help figure out his identity. It was a shiny silver film reel that said, \"Starring S'More.\" S'More explained, \"As you can tell, I'm very talented on and off stage.\" This lead to Nicole to theorize that S'More might not only be a singer, but maybe an actor too.\nRelated: All 16 Masked Singer Season 10 Costumes Revealed\nFor S'More's second performance on NFL Night, he sang and danced to a rousing rendition of \"Moves Like Jagger\" by Maroon 5. In his second clue package, he began by saying, \"Last week, I burst forth with bravado, and I'm thrilled to have made it to NFL Night.\" S'More then shared how he got started in show business, stating, \"I was born for the fearless life in the spotlight, but my father was afraid to lose his son to the fantastical world of fame.\" S'More said this while he was on a theater stage. He was then shown standing in front of a bubbling cauldron.\nS'More went on to say, \"While I was still in high school, a huge opportunity to work with an industry legend came my way.\" A television set with an M on it was then shown. S'More then looked at a picture of his father, an older S'More, saying, \"But when my dad found out, he told me to turn down the gig. I made the hard decision to move out.\"\nS'More was next seen taking a bow on stage. He said, \"Years down the road, I conquered the Broadway stage, a lifelong goal.\" There was then a Masked Singer game console with a video game controller on the screen. S'More shared, \"There was no way it could get any better, until one night after curtain call, I saw my dad backstage. Hearing him say he was proud of me was really the biggest win I could ask for. So dad, this one's for you.\" \nAfter S'More's performance, he moonwalked on the stage. Then, NFL player DeSean Jackson brought out a clue. It was a bucket full of oranges. S'More explained, \"I've tasted victory before, and it's so sweet. I hope to do so again here at The Masked Singer!\"\nThe Masked Singer season 10 panelists offered some interesting first guesses for S'More's identity. Nicole commented that the first thing that popped out to her was \"step by step.\" She pointed out that they've had members of boy bands such as *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees, and now they were due for a member of the New Kids on the Block, who have a hit song called \"Step By Step.\" Because of this, Nicole guessed that S'More could be Joey McIntyre.\nJenny focused on S'More's instant rise to fame, and guessed Justin Guarini, who was the runner-up to Kelly Clarkson American Idol season 1. S'More's mustache and goatee reminded Robin of Kevin Richardson from the Backstreet Boys. On NFL Night, the panelists continued to focus on boy bands from Florida because of the oranges clue. Nicole guessed JC Chasez from *NSYNC, who originated in Orlando. Robin stuck with his guess of Kevin because Kevin was on Broadway in Chicago. He also thought the game console could refer to the Backstreet Boys' song, \"Quit Playing Games (With My Heart).\" However, Ken thought that S'More could be actor Simu Liu.\nAlthough these guesses make sense, another possibility for S'More's identity could be Ashley Parker Angel, who was a member of O-Town, the group that was formed on MTV's reality television series, Making the Band. The M on the television set might refer to MTV. In addition, the O in O-Town stands for Orlando, which could be represented by the oranges. O-Town was the first group to be signed by Clive Davis to his record label, J Records, so he could be the industry legend S'More was referencing.\nThe angel clue could refer to Ashley's last name. The pizza clue could reference his appearance in the film, Pizza Man. Ashley has appeared on Broadway in Hairspray and Wicked. The cauldron clue could be a reference to Wicked.\nS'More is definitely still melting hearts with his soulful singing and smooth persona. There will certainly be many more clues about his identity because he made it through to the next round of the competition. Whoever S'More turns out to be, the competition is heating up because of his sweet and sizzling vocals.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}

He began by saying, \"To be honest with you, I never imagined myself dressing up as a pickle singing center stage.\" He was shaking up spray paint as he said it. A Joker playing card was shown hanging taped to a locker. Pickle continued, \"But, now that I'm here, this wild boy's planning on winning it.

The streaming platform has a large library of films, both new and old, and many of them chronicle blossoming relationships and rekindled romances. Whether they're modern classics or newer releases, these movies are sure to evoke some major emotions. As for which feelings they'll conjure, it depends on the type of romance film in question.\nAmazon's got something for everyone, whether it's an entertaining rom-com, like The Wedding Singer, or a more dramatic tale of love, like Chemical Hearts. The streamer's offerings run the gamut, showcasing a variety of different relationships. Some will have viewers cheering the main characters on, while others will leave them with tears running down heir cheeks. If one thing's certain, it's that all of these romance movies will hook the Prime Video subscriber watching them from start to finish.\nRELATED: 10 Of The Most Romantic Movies Ever Made, According To Reddit\nBased on Casey McQuiston's best-selling book of the same name, Red, White & Royal Blue is a newer addition to Amazon's lineup of romance movies. The Prime Video exclusive follows Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the current U.S. president, and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine) of Britain as they begin a secret romance. The politics of their relationship force them to keep things under wraps, but that proves much easier said than done. When their roles threaten to tear them apart, Alex and Henry must choose between people's expectations and each other. Despite all the high-stakes drama, Red, White & Royal Blue is a breezy and fun romance.\nAnother movie based on a best-selling romance novel — this time from author Sally Thorne — The Hating Game is currently available to rent or purchase on Prime Video. And it's well worth the investment. Following corporate rivals Lucy Hutton (Lucy Hale) and Joshua Templeton (Austin Stowell), The Hating Game is the perfect watch for anyone who enjoys a good hate-to-love relationship. As two assistants at the same publishing company, Lucy and Joshua are constantly attempting to outdo one another. However, their intense office rivalry evolves into a steamy attraction. It's one that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats for the movie's full runtime.\nDirected by Eugene Ashe, the 2020 romance movie Sylvie's Love is among the most compelling currently streaming on Prime Video — and it's the perfect option for anyone who enjoys a good period piece. Opening in 1950s Harlem, the film follows the titular Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) as she falls for a saxophone player named Robert Halloway (Nnamdi Asomugha). The pair embark on a whirldwind romance that will sweep viewers up with it. Even after the pair separates for years, their feelings remain strong as ever. This second-chance romance is bound to tug on viewers heartstrings, especially with the standout performances from Thompson and Asomugha.\nRELATED: 10 Films To Watch If You Liked Prime Video's Sylvie's Love\n2022's Bros is another LGBTQ+ romance movie streaming on Prime Video, and Bros truly deserves to be a hit despite its box office flop. Directed by Nicholas Stoller, the movie follows Bobby (Billy Eichner) and Aaron (Luke Macfarlane) as they reluctantly develop feelings for one another — a development that threatens their beloved \"freedom.\" So begins a comical narrative that sees them dealing with their commitment issues, all while an eclectic soundtrack plays and numerous A-listers cameo. Bros is an all-around fun time, and its ending is equal parts realistic and satisfying.\nThose looking for more of Lili Reinhart after Riverdale's series finale should check out Chemical Hearts on Prime Video — though no one should go into this particular romance movie looking for a cookie-cutter happy ending. The film sees Reinhart starring opposite Austin Abrams. The two play Grace Town and Henry Page, and their teenage characters fall head over heels for one another. Unfortunately, like most high school romances, things don't play out as expected. Chemical Hearts showcases stellar performances from both its leads, along with a number of scenes that will leave viewers misty-eyed before the movie is through.\nThose looking for a more fantastical story can relive the hype of 2008's Twilight, a supernatural romance based on Stephenie Meyer's book of the same name. Most people have heard of Twilight by now, but the film follows vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) as he develops feelings for the new girl in town, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Cheesy and occasionally funny without meaning to be, Twilight is by no means a masterpiece within the romance genre. However, it's fun and delivers on the intense feelings of its leads. There's a reason the movie became so popular, spawning multiple sequels and building a fanbase that still exists over a decade later.\nThose searching for a lighthearted romance movie on Prime Video should look no further than 2022's Ticket to Paradise, which combines an A+ cast and a stunning setting to stellar effect. Starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts — and yes, that duo is enough reason to check this out — the film follows two divorced parents as they travel to Bali to stop their daughter from making a huge mistake in the name of love. Naturally, this stirs up all kinds of feelings between the two characters, delivering a second-chance romance that will leave even the most hard-hearted viewer in their feelings by Ticket to Paradise's ending.\nA movie that's a bit heavier than the standard rom-com, 2023's Somebody I Used to Know is still worth the watch, if only for Alison Brie's and Jay Ellis' performances. They play Ally and Sean, two exes who have seemingly moved on from one another — though that's quickly called into question when Ally returns to her hometown and they reunite. The fact that Sean is engaged complicates matters, raising all kinds of difficult questions for Ally. These don't lead where viewers might expect, with Somebody I Used to Know turning some of the genre's most problematic tropes on their heads in favor of a more modern and surprising conclusion.\nThe oldest romance movie on this list, Four Weddings and a Funeral holds up as a solid viewing experience nearly three decades after its debut. Streaming on Prime Video, the film follows the English Charles (Hugh Grant) as he courts an American named Carrie (Andie MacDowell), who he continues to run into at weddings and eventually a funeral. The performances from Grant and MacDowell are enough reason to give this a watch, but the movie's focus on fate is also a compelling one that will leave viewers feeling uplifted.\nThe Wedding Singer is a classic rom-com movie, and it's among the most well-known ones streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Starring Adam Sandler as Robbie Hart and Drew Barrymore as Julia Sullivan, this movie is worth watching for its star power alone. Of course, the fun plot, which sees Robbie and Julia realizing they're engaged to the wrong people — conveniently at the same time they meet one another — adds to the viewing experience. The Wedding Singer is one of those romance movies that remains entertaining no matters how many times viewers have seen it. Perhaps that's why its popularity has lasted for so many years.\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

During the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, The Drew Barrymore Show came under fire for deciding to resume production without its WGA writers. Following extensive criticism and backlash, Barrymore made the decision to not resume the show until the strike ended, only for it to conclude a week later.\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, White, Kinon, and Koe turned down an offer to return to the show, which is slated to return on October 16 for season 4. The Drew Barrymore Show is now interviewing and seeking new writers under the new WGA guidelines.\nWhite, Kinon, and Koe choosing not to return to The Drew Barrymore Show marks the beginning of a change in Hollywood following the end of the WGA strike. With the WGA holding out for 148 days, the writers stood firm until they received a new deal that guaranteed fair pay, better working conditions, and restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. Even though the strike has ended, the WGA and its members are continuing to fight for what they deserve.\nRelated: Writers' Strike Deal Explained: 8 Biggest Points & Agreements Confirmed\nWhen the talk show planned to return without its WGA writers, it sent a clear message that the writers' work was not valued. They understandably do not want to return to a production that does not fully value them or their work. White, Kinon, and Koe are setting a powerful example, showing that television and film writers do not need to settle, and they deserve productions that value them. The new WGA guidelines that they fought for tirelessly over the course of 148 days not only offers protections and better compensation, but has also set a new precedent across the industry.\nWhen the SAG-AFTRA strike ultimately ends, there will likely also be a shift among actors, with there being less tolerance in the industry for productions where the work of writers and actors are not fairly valued. As for The Drew Barrymore Show, the talk show is unlikely to have a smooth return given their initial decision to return without their WGA writers. Drew Barrymore couldn't have known when the strike would end, but the decision to resume during the WGA strike feels even more unwise and short-sighted given how soon the strike ended after the initial announcement.\nSource: THR\n"}

Appearing in Void Rivals #4, the Decepticon Shockwave is left in control of Cybertron, suggesting that the Decepticons won the Cybertronian war millennia ago.\nSkybound shocked the world when they revealed they had acquired the Transformers license with the surprise appearance of Jetfire in Void Rivals #1, and now they’ve provided a shock of a different kind with the latest Transformer to appear in the Energon Universe. The appearance of Shockwave in Void Rivals #4 by Robert Kirkman, Lorenzo de Felici, Matheus Lopes and Rus Wooten is a major revelation, not least because the Decepticon warrior’s appearance confirms that the Decepticons have won the war.\nShockwave appears on Cybertron as a Skuxxoid bounty hunter attempts to sell off a bounty to the Decepticons. Shockwave turns the Skuxxoid away, saying they don’t have the resources on Cybertron to keep themselves running full-time, let alone to pay for any bounties.\nThe Decepticons ruling Cybertron following some failure on the part of Optimus Prime is something that’s been hinted at since the Energon Universe was first announced, so getting confirmation of that story point is a huge reveal and should amp up the stakes for the coming Transformers series by writer/artist Daniel Warren Johnson and colorist Mike Spicer. The set-up is reminiscent of the original G1 Transformers cartoon, which features a band of Autobots and Decepticons stranded on Earth following the great Cybertronian war.\nAt that point, Shockwave was left in control of the remaining Decepticons on Cybertron while Megatron followed after Optimus Prime to search the universe for more Energon. It further hammers home how Skybound is pulling heavily from Transformers’ G1 era, and it’s not a bad direction for the franchise to take. Having Optimus Prime and his Autobots reeling from losing the Cybertronian war makes for a great starting point for the new series, as they now must overcome insurmountable odds by standing up to the triumphant Decepticons once more.\nWhere the Energon Universe era goes from here is anyone’s guess, but Skybound has certainly given fans plenty to be excited about. By aligning fellow Hasbro property G.I. Joe more closely to the world of the Transformers than ever before, the creators have found a way to relaunch both properties in a way that’s generated unprecedented levels of excitement for both franchises.\nVoid Rivals #4 is on sale now, and Transformers #1 is on sale October 4th, both from Skybound Entertainment.\n"}

Prime Video, specifically, has a massive selection of action flicks, but not all of them can live up to the standards of its best 10.\nSome of Prime Video's best current movies come from the action genre, though to be fair, some of its worst probably come from the action genre as well. It's particularly easy in action movies to focus solely on spectacle and let the narrative and acting go by the wayside, which leads to some really poor flicks. Luckily, Prime Video is well stocked with movies that manage to avoid that mistake, especially in the case of these 10 outstanding action movies.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nTop Gun: Maverick is one of the six movies to make $1 billion at the box office since 2020, proving that this sequel film is well worth a watch.

Kinley and Ahmed are ambushed by Taliban forces during the War in Afghanistan, starting the film off on an action-packed note. The Covenant received positive reviews from critics and did fairly well at the box office during its limited theatrical release. This is easily one of the best action movies currently on Prime Video, especially for fans of military films.\nAlthough Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves bombed at the box office, it's still a great action movie that's available to stream on Prime Video. Honor Among Thieves received positive reviews from critics despite its poor box office performance, and now that it's on Prime Video, the film's streaming numbers can help recover what was lost at the box office. This film has a lovable blend of humor and dramatic storytelling, interspersed with engaging action sequences and memorable characters, making it well worth a watch for Prime Video subscribers.\nThe Batman, starring Robert Pattinson as the title character, is another worthy addition in the long line of Batman movies. This riveting action filmed was widely acclaimed by critics and performed strongly at the box office, bringing in around $770 million worldwide. The Batman is driven by strong performances from the cast and expertly crafted visuals. The film's dark camera lenses give it an ominous feel that contributes to the film's dark overall feel.

Skyfall is packed with incredible visuals as well, and it's generally positive reviews from critics praised the film's expertly choreographed action sequences. This is a strong option for Prime Video subscriber looking for an exciting action flick.\nV for Vendetta is a thought-provoking action film that follows an anarchist's attempts to spark revolution within a totalitarian version of Great Britain.

{"title": "8 Witcher Book Moments That Will Help Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt Win You Over", "date": "2023-10-04 23:31:44", "text": "Liam Hemsworth has big shoes to fill as he steps in as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher, but these 8 book moments can allow him to win fans over.\nLiam Hemsworth has big shoes to fill as he prepares to take over the lead role of Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher, but there are eight big moments from the books that can help Hemsworth win over The Witcher's fans. Henry Cavill played Geralt in the first three seasons of The Witcher, inhabiting the role with a natural ease that made him the main attraction of this Netflix original. However, Cavill grew fed up with the show's controversial creative decisions, finally abandoning the show and leading Netflix to replace him with Liam Hemsworth.\nTaking over for Cavill will be no easy task, and The Witcher seems to have already lost a big chunk of its viewership with Cavill's departure, but Hemsworth is an accomplished actor with as good a chance as anyone of revitalizing this struggling franchise. He will have to do his best to replicate the things that Cavill did well, but he needs to put his own spin on the character as well. These eight big moments from the books will give Hemsworth the chance he needs to ingratiate himself with fans and leave his mark on the franchise.\nRelated: 10 Most Important Characters Introduced In Witcher Season 3 (& How They Set Up Season 4)\nOne of the most important parts of Hemsworth's role in replacing Henry Cavill will be how well he handles the action sequences. Geralt's fight with the half-elf, Schirrú, represents a good early opportunity for Hemsworth to show that he is up to the task. Shirrú is one of Vilgefortz's (Mahesh Jadu) hired assassins sent to kill Geralt after Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) reveals his location under torture. If The Witcher season 4 can save the show, this fight against Shirrú can play a big part in that. It may end up being brief, but it's one of the earliest book moments for Hemsworth to demonstrate his swordsmanship in.\nIn The Witcher novels, Cahir (Eamon Farren) begins shadowing Geralt's group after Emperor Emhyr (Bart Edwards) order his execution for failing to capture Ciri (Freya Allan). Geralt saves his life when they stumble onto him in the woods, but he refuses Cahir's help in the search for Ciri. Eventually, after the two are stranded together following Cahir's injury from Schirrú, Geralt accepts Cahir's help and his honest intentions concerning Ciri. This is a heartwarming moment in the books that could provide a good way for Hemsworth to display emotion and compassion, and possibly, ingratiate himself to fans.\nThe Witcher season 3's Cahir twist seems to have started this process early, so it's possible that Geralt's acceptance of Cahir will come earlier than it does in the books. That might be a good thing though since it is a valuable opportunity for Hemsworth to display his emotional range as an actor. This is also a significant moment in the story because, for a time, Geralt wants to refuse everyone's help in the search for Ciri, so the fact that he is willing to accept help here represents a big moment of personal growth for The Witcher's main character.\nGeralt being knighted by Queen Meve (Rebecca Hanssen) of Lyria and Rivia after the Battle for the Bridge is a big moment because it gives Geralt a right to use the title, \"Of Rivia\", which until this moment, he had simply used to make him sound more trustworthy. This is another great opportunity for Hemsworth to show off his acting range as he tries to capture Geralt's mixture of bemusement and pride at being knighted. Geralt has always been scornful of knights up to this moment, but he feels some sort of honor in being recognized by a monarch, leading to an emotionally nuanced moment for Hemsworth to execute.\nThe Battle for the Bridge is an epic confrontation in which Liam Hemsworth's Geralt can show why he is one of the characters who could beat Vilgefortz in the future. Geralt and his company end up getting entangled in this fight when the ferry they are traveling on is trapped between a Nilfgaardian army and an army of Lyrian and Rivian resistance. This conflict comes to a head when Geralt and his friends are forced to depart their ferry and choose a side or risk being killed in the crossfire.\nNaturally, they choose not to fight with the Nilfgaardians, instead choosing to aid the Lyrians and Rivians in their attempt to gain control of a critical bridge that crosses the mighty Yaruga River. Geralt fights with uncontrolled rage, running along the edge of the bridge and cutting down anyone in range. Geralt turns the tide of this battle almost single-handedly, as the close quarters on the bridge force the Nilfgaardians to challenge him one at a time, leaving them with no chance of defeating the magically mutated witcher. Hemsworth can use this moment to prove his swordsmanship is worthy of succeeding Cavill.\nGeralt's final confrontation with Vilgefortz is one of the most epic moments in the entire Witcher book series. This is an absolutely critical moment for Hemsworth's Geralt to nail, but if he does, he can change the narrative around his replacement of Henry Cavill. Geralt fights Vilgefortz for the second time with the help of a protective amulet he receives from Fringilla Vigo (Mimi Ndiweni). The duel happens in Stygga Castle after Geralt overhears that Vilgefortz is hiding out there. This is the biggest opportunity for Hemsworth to prove his worth in the role of Geralt of Rivia.\nRelated: This Witcher Book Character Will Fix The Show's Villain Problem In Season 4\nGeralt will eventually befriend a highly intelligent higher vampire named Regis, whom Geralt has lots of interesting philosophical discussions with. These conversations can allow Hemsworth to display the intelligent side of Geralt that loves to debate intellectual topics. This side of the character has largely been absent from Netflix's adaptation of the series, but Hemsworth can bring this side of Geralt into the show and improve the character as a whole while potentially winning over fans in the process.\nAnother moment with Geralt and Regis that Hemsworth can take advantage of to win over fans is their rescue of an innocent woman being accused of witchcraft. Geralt and Regis manage to outwit the man trying to have her executed, ultimately using Regis' vampire abilities to complete a trial that is invented to be impossible. This is the type of noble deed that makes fans like Geralt in the first place, so Hemsworth needs to take advantage of it and win over fans by showing his ability to portray Geralt's altruistic side.\nOne of the final opportunities Hemsworth will have to win over Witcher fans will be in the Rivian pogrom that takes place at the end of The Lady of the Lake. Geralt nearly dies trying to protect his dwarven friends from the rioting humans, proving again that he is a caring friend who is willing to die for others. Hemsworth needs to depict Geralt's desperation in the face a charging mob without losing his characteristic bravery. This will be a final moment of desperate altruism as Geralt does his best to defend his friends and stop the killing.\n"}
{"title": "1 Far Side Comic Is Hiding a Surprisingly Dark Joke About Charlie Brown", "date": "2023-10-04 23:31:44", "text": "One Far Side strip imagined a universe where all the newspaper comic strips are real - and Charlie Brown has a much darker side than anyone realized.\nGary Larson's The Far Side was a longtime hit in the newspapers – and one installment of the strip suggested it kept its place there through underhanded means. The comic employed dark humor and morbid surrealism over the course of its original 16-year run, and wasn't afraid to tease its neighbors in the funny pages.\nThe \"Far Side's Spy Center\" strip is on the surface a seemingly lighthearted bit, a wall of television screens depicting other cartoon characters, being watched by Far Side regulars: two stereotypical Larson-style humans, a snake, and a cow.\nIt is only as the reader takes a closer look at the TV screens that this Far Side panel reveals its darkest joke: Charlie Brown, threatening to put down Snoopy.\nRelated: Far Side's Most Confusing Comic Has an Incredibly Simple Explanation\nAll the references in this Far Side strip can be hard to catch, but eagle-eyed readers can depict references including Bloom County's Opus realizing he's being watched, and Hobbes about to attack Calvin. Gary Larson himself is apparently under observation as well, appearing in the top right-hand corner of the frame. In the center of the frame, however, good ol' Charlie Brown is threatening to have Snoopy put down. It is a particularly dark joke, which works because it is the diametric opposite of Charles Schulz's Peanuts. The Far Side, no stranger to controversy, made several Peanuts references throughout its run, in typical dark, and bizarre Far Side fashion.\nAnother stand-out Peanuts reference in The Far Side, similarly a dark reference to Snoopy's demise, plays on his iconic \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" stories. A fighter pilot stands next to his plane, with his kills painted on the side – including the silhouette of a familiar scarf-wearing dog, on top of a familiar dog house. Additionally, Peanuts character, Lucy Van Pelt, was the subject of her own Far Side joke, this one featuring a group of anthropologists instead come across ancient art, depicting Lucy as drawn by Charles Schulz. At the time of its printing, Peanuts had been running for about 30 years, making this an off-brand homage to the comic's longevity.\nGary Larson often used parody in The Far Side, and it is clear that his references to Peanuts and other comic strips resulted from a love of the medium; being lampooned in a Far Side strip was an honor, not an insult. \"Far Side's Spy Center\" is one of Larson's most visually ambitious strips, as he often favored minimalism in his cartoons. Here, the caption is minimalized, but the references to other comic strips speak volumes, both about Larson's own humor, and what he thought of the humor of his contemporaries. Charles Schulz was without a doubt a major influence on Larson's The Far Side, who in turn paid homage in his own particular style.\nAs far back as she can remember, Casey Connor always wanted to be a Goodfeather writer.

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released in 1993, Cool Runnings was based on the true story of the first Jamaican national bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The sports comedy starred the late John Candy as the former Olympian Irving Blitzer who coaches the four-man bobsleigh team, which includes Derice Bannock (Leon Robinson), Junior Bevil (Rawle D Lewis), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), and Sanka Coffie (Doug E Doug).\nIn a new interview with The Independent for the film's 30th anniversary, Turteltaub and the Cool Runnings cast opened up about the controversy regarding the characters’ Jamaican accents. The actor credited as Leon says that Disney wanted him to \"sound like a black Aladdin.\" It was also suggested to Turteltaub that the cast sound like Sebastian the Crab, a Disney character with a Trinidadian accent. Read what the cast and director shared below:\nLewis: I saw it morph into the movie that it is now. It was something that had never been told before – Jamaicans in tights? People were like, \"How’s this going to go under the Disney umbrella?\"\nLeon: They wanted me to sound like a black Aladdin. They wanted a Disney version. It was tough because if anybody wants to be authentic, it’s me — but I’m a professional and I had to do the job.\nYoba: They’d say, \"People in Middle America won’t be able to understand you.\" At that time, people had less access to cultural differences and didn’t know how Jamaican really sounded.\nTurteltaub: The next day, I told the cast, \"I’m going to get fired if you don’t sound like Sebastian the Crab. Please don’t get me fired.\" We joked about it but they got it. They understood. \"We’re not going to do Sebastian the Crab but we’re going to make an Americanized version of the movie that people around the world can understand.\" Times have changed a lot in 30 years. There’s zero chance I’d get this job – and I probably shouldn’t get it. I’m on the side of the people who say I shouldn’t have directed this and yet we ended up with a pretty great movie. It’s tricky.\nBefore Turteltaub took over the movie, Brian Gibson was attached to direct a more serious take on Cool Runnings. Once Disney took over the film, they removed all references to sex and drugs and turned it into a family-friendly film. This creative shift caused Gibson to drop out and in turn, Turteltaub was hired, though he had several battles with then-Disney boss Jeffrey Katzenberg, who worried that the characters' Jamaican accents would be difficult to understand. From that point on, this became a point of constant contention.\nRelated: The 90 Best Movies On Disney+ (October 2023)\nKatzenberg and company wanted a more Disneyfied version of the characters' Jamaican accents, a \"black Aladdin,” as Leon says. However, the cast wanted to present a more authentic Jamaican cadence. Katzenberg threatened to fire Turteltaub if he couldn't understand the characters' accents, so the cast agreed to \"make an Americanised version of the movie that people around the world can understand.\" While Cool Runnings would go on to become a beloved feel-good classic, it was criticized for perpetuating caricatures rather than authentic representations of the Jamaican dialect.\nSource: The Independent\n"}
{"title": "A Million Miles Away True Story: What Really Happened To Astronaut José M. Hernández", "date": "2023-10-04 23:20:44", "text": "A Million Miles Away is a biopic based on the life of Astronaut Jose M. Hernandez. From cast to theme, here's how it compares to his real life. \nA Million Miles Away is a biopic based on the life of NASA Astronaut Jose M. Hernandez, and, as with any biopic, it's fair to wonder how closely it sticks to his true story. Directed by Alejandra Marquez Abella, the film is based on Hernandez's 2012 autobiography Reaching For The Stars: The Inspiring Story Of A Migrant Farm Worker Turned Astronaut. A Million Miles Away combines the collaborative efforts of NASA and Amazon Prime with the passion of the film's director. It stars Rosa Salazar as Jose's caring and devoted wife Adela and Michael Peña in the lead role of Jose.\nA Million Miles Away depicts one man's relentless pursuit to make his dreams come true, a concept many can relate to. The film has received a co-sign from the NASA astronaut himself, who has gone on record to praise how \"masterful\" of a job the film's portrayal of his life is. Although the film checks off boxes for style and tone, Abella was allowed some room for poetic reinvention. Here's how the film compares to the real-life story of Jose M. Hernandez.\nJose M. Hernandez was born on August 7, 1962. He was born in French Camp, California (although he considers Stockton, California his hometown) to a family of migrant farmworkers from Mexico. According to an interview with ABC News, Hernandez knew as young as 10 years old that he wanted to fly out to space. After seeing astronaut Gene Cernan grace the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, he was inspired to be among the stars.\nJose's dreams took him all the way from the fields of California to the halls of the University of California Santa Barbara, where he earned his Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2001, he began his career with NASA when he joined the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. By 2004, he was accepted into NASA's highly competitive astronaut program after reportedly being rejected 11 times. In August 2009, he embarked on a 14-day mission to the International Space Station on the STS-128 and made history as the first migrant farm worker to travel to space.\nSince retiring from his career at NASA in 2011, Hernandez has become a multi-hyphenated success as a philanthropist, author, and CEO of his own engineering company. When he's not promoting the advancements of Tierra Luna Engineering, he can often be found performing outreach for underrepresented youth, encouraging their dreams of pursuing careers in STEM, and exposing them to the fascinating world of space exploration.\nA Million Miles Away chronicles Jose's journey from migrant worker to NASA astronaut. The movie includes major key moments in Hernandez's life, touching on both advancements in his career to his home life in California. Although A Million Miles Away focuses on Hernandez's story, it also highlights integral players and components of his life that helped him become the successful man he is today.\nA Million Miles Away doesn't just showcase Jose's roots as a means to an end, it plays up how Hernandez's background as a Mexican-American farmer influences his career in science, equipping him with the necessary tools he needed to thrive. The film not only depicts a groundbreaking tale, it also glorifies the discipline, persistence, and support he needed to take his life from farm to space.\nA Million Miles Away checks off boxes for style, tone, and attention to detail. It manages to sneak in moments both big and small from real conversations with family members to the moment he gets accepted into NASA. This realistic depiction of success demonstrates how small fragmented moments all play a major role in the outcome of someone's success.\nThe inclusion of moments like his first day of work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where a receptionist mistakes him for a janitor, is a testament to the kind of roadblocks Hernandez faced as a man trying to achieve the seemingly impossible. In the same interview with ABC, Hernandez admits that he had moments of self-doubt where he questioned whether he was worthy of the opportunities he'd been given. He also suspected that his background as a migrant worker may have been held against him in some capacity.\nHowever, his persistence and unwavering support from his loved ones helped him get to new heights, and in the film, this is especially apparent. Hernandez's network of real supporters is highlighted in A Million Miles Away. From his parents (who reportedly gave up their dreams of being homeowners to help support Hernandez) to his second-grade teacher Ms. Young (who allegedly encouraged his parents to settle in one place), the film features references to real tender moments that shaped the trajectory for Jose and his family. With the help of NASA's clearance, A Million Miles Away was able to secure real-life footage, locations, and technical expertise.\nTo take it a step further, the film's portrayal of Mexican-American culture has made it a hit among the Latino community, something that gives director Alejandra Marquez Abella pride. The film is praised for its authentic portrayal of the Latino community all across the board. A Million Miles Away features Mexican food, music, and celebrations that help capture the essence of the Mexican-American lifestyle. Additionally, the film portrays the strong sense of interconnectedness among family and community that is a driving force in the Latino community.\nAs heartfelt and authentic as the movie is, it does leave out a few details. This tends to happen when someone condenses an entire life into a two-hour film. Although a reference to Hernandez's career at The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory makes it into the film, it neglects to touch on one of his most vital career milestones.\nWhile employed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Hernandez contributed to the creation of a tool that broke ground in cancer screening and imagery. He was the co-creator of the first full-field digital mammography system that detects early signs of breast cancer. Although he reportedly wishes this groundbreaking moment in his career would've made the cut in A Million Miles Away, Hernandez is still fully supportive of the biopic. In essence, while a few things were left out or tweaked, the biopic is about as close to Hernandez' real story as possible.\nSource: ABC News\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

{"title": "10 Most Unnecessary Remakes Of Classic Movies", "date": "2023-10-04 23:10:45", "text": "While some movie remakes have been successful, others miss the target or add nothing new. And some films should never have received a remake at all.\nIn Hollywood, many remakes of classic movies have been released over the years, but there are a number of remakes that were unnecessary as they either didn't add anything new or didn't honor the source material. Some remakes can retell a classic story, some can add a new twist, and some can re-imagine the story differently from the original. The success of a remake depends on its similarities to the source material, its production, and its connection to both audiences and critics.\nSome movie remakes such as King Kong, A Star is Born, and West Side Story have been released to critical acclaim and regarded as a refreshing take on the original story. Other remakes miss their target and are a bitter disappointment. There are plenty of movie remakes out there that have been seen as entirely unnecessary and unneeded by anybody at all. Here are a few of them.\nReleased in 1980, Alan Parker's Fame centers on students attending New York's High School of Performing Arts, as they progress from their first day to graduation. The 1980 film received praise for its acting, music, and ability to portray the highs and lows of success in a relatable manner to audiences. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score and is still regarded as one of the best musical drama films of the 1980s.\nThe 2009 remake followed the same storyline of attending a performing arts school while using different characters but was regarded as shallow compared to the original film. It received criticism for its clichéd stories, lack of proper character development, and removing the serious and darker themes that were an essential part of the 1980 film. Critics and viewers alike agreed that this remake tried to take advantage of High School Musical's success and relate to a younger audience, but it lacked the soul and heart that made the original a hit.\nThere were high hopes for 2017's The Mummy; it was intended to be the first in Universal's Dark Universe based on their classic monsters of the 20th century. With Tom Cruise starring as Sergeant Nick Morton, the film sees an Ancient Egyptian queen being accidentally released from her tomb and causing havoc across present-day London. The Mummy is regarded as one of the most legendary monsters of all time, so there were hopes that the 2017 film would bring a new exciting take on the story.\nWhen the film was released, however, it failed at the box office and received a cold response from audiences. Critics felt the movie stripped away all the humor and fun that made the original 1999 trilogy a success. The original trilogy's star, Brendan Fraser, has stated that removing the fun is where the movie went wrong. Despite strong action sequences and an interesting take on the story, The Mummy couldn't connect with viewers, which led to Universal canceling the Dark Universe altogether.\nDirected by Herbert Ross, Footloose is a 1984 musical drama film that follows Kevin Bacon's teenager Ren, who moves to a small town where dancing is banned. With the help of new friends and his new crush Ariel, Ren fights to overturn the town's views on dancing and the right to express themselves through music. The original was a box-office success and is memorable for its popular soundtrack; it received more recognition in recent years thanks to its multiple references in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.\nParamount released a remake of Footloose in 2011, starring Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald. Unlike other remakes, it wasn't a complete failure, receiving moderate reviews and performing decently at the box office. But critics agree that a remake of Footloose just wasn't needed in the modern era and it didn't have the same emotional impact on viewers as the original did.\nProduced by Steven Spielberg, 1982's Poltergeist looks at a suburban family whose home is haunted by a host of ghosts that abduct their youngest child. Thanks to its talented cast, relatable characters, and gripping story, the original Poltergeist delivers pure terror and suspense and is regarded as a horror classic. Heather O'Rourke's line \"They're here!\" is oft-quoted as one of the more memorable lines in the horror genre.\nMany horror movies have received a remake over the years, so it was no real surprise that Poltergeist would end up receiving one in 2015. However, many agree that the remake fell flat, relying too much on jump scares and adding nothing new or exciting to the story. Despite the cast giving their all, the Russo Bros' Poltergeist remakeis largely regarded as a pointless and unnecessary rehash of an already iconic horror film.\nLike Poltergeist, House of Wax is another remake of a classic horror film, the 1953 Andre DeToth film, which itself was a remake of 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum. The 2005 film sees a group of friends stranded on their way to a football match, and they seek assistance at a wax museum. But they soon find themselves in a fight for survival and must try to escape before they find themselves becoming the wax museum's next exhibits.\nHouse of Wax tries to deliver a new twist to the original story, adding an amount of gore and slash that was not seen in the original two movies. Despite receiving some praise for its casting and new take on the original story, House of Wax was ultimately written off as being too bland and mundane. It certainly couldn't quite hold a candle to the terrors of the original films.\nThere have been many adaptations of Stephen King's works; his first novel, Carrie received its first film release in 1976. The original film, starring Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. It has had a major influence on pop culture and is considered an inspiration for many horror films.\nRemaking an already iconic film is never easy, but director Kimberly Peirce brought Carrie into the 21st century with a 2013 remake. Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore did a decent job as Carrie and Margaret White, respectively, and the film tried to embrace a modern setting, but it was jarring that a few old bits of slang were still included in the remake. Ultimately, critics felt Carrie brought nothing new or thrilling to the original story, regarding it as a redundant version of the 1976 classic.\nPlanet of the Apes has seen many film adaptations thanks to its fascinating concept. Its most iconic adaptation is the 1968 sci-fi movie starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who finds himself stranded on a planet that is inhabited by talking apes. It is considered a classic science fiction film with one of the best sci-fi twist endings ever.\nTim Burton decided to bring a modern take on the story with his 2001 remake. But despite stunning visuals and make-up designs, critics considered the remake a letdown, due to its confusing story, lackluster performances, and unpopular take on the iconic ending. It was such a failure that a sequel was shelved, and it would be another decade before the franchise was rebooted again, this time much more successfully.\nProbably one of the most infamous remakes of all time, The Wicker Man has become a movie that has achieved \"so bad, it's good\" status. Marketed as a horror movie, The Wicker Man has been regarded by critics and audiences as unintentionally funny thanks in part to Nicolas Cage's over-the-top acting and its poorly written script. The unintentional comedic aspect has allowed the movie to become a cult hit and a part of internet meme culture.\nIn contrast, the original 1973 film is considered a cinematic masterpiece. It was praised for its subtlety in its portrayal of horror with the beliefs of Christianity and paganism as well as stunning performances from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee. The final scene of the movie is regarded as one of the most frightening moments in movie history; considered one of the greatest folk-horror films, the 1973 original stands tall against the abysmal 2006 remake.\nAlfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the most influential movies, regardless of genre. Starring Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, proprietor of Bates Hotel and sadistic murderer, Psycho is seen as one of the best psychological horror films and one that laid the blueprint for movies that came after. Psycho's iconic shower scene, where Janet Leigh's Marion Crane is murdered by Bates, left such a mark on visual style in filmmaking that it continues to influence certain shots in modern movies today.\nGus Van Sant's 1998 remake film is notorious for recreating the original as a shot-for-shot remake, copying Hitchcock's camera style and the original script. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche were seen as greatly miscast in their roles as Norman Bates and Marion Crane, and critics despised the film for its lack of thrills and horror. Winning a Razzie award for Worst Remake, Van Sant's Psycho is a remake that nobody needed.\nRecreating a classic film is no easy task, but the remake of 1959's Ben-Hur was a critical and commercial disaster. Adapted from the novel by Lew Wallace, 1959's Ben-Hur sees Charlton Heston as the titular character, fighting against the Roman Empire and trying to restore honor to his family name. It is hailed as one of the best religious drama films ever made, thanks to its influential musical score, its talented cast, and its iconic chariot race scene. It won a record 11 Academy Awards in 1960 and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.\nThe remake failed to make any significant impact, being deemed a pointless endeavor by critics. With the 2016 Ben-Hur remake losing close to $120 million at the box office, audiences clearly felt the same. The CGI effects and modern edits couldn't hold up to the epic cinematography and production of director William Wyler's original film. A misguided and incompetent remake that pales in comparison to its predecessor, Ben-Hur is perhaps at the top of the list of the most unnecessary remakes of classic movies.\nEidhne Gallagher is a writer, creator and researcher  based in Ireland, the Land of Saints and Scholars.  A self-described bookworm, she lived her childhood with her head stuck in a book.

{"title": "10 Space Movies That Experts Claim Are Wildly Inaccurate", "date": "2023-10-04 23:01:44", "text": "Although space movies transport viewers beyond Earth, experts have found that not every movie set in space is getting the science right.\nWith so many space stories out there, it's no surprise that experts have found that many science-fiction movies get real-life astronauts and the science of space wrong. Although space movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey are often praised for their stunning visuals, providing extremely accurate representations of space is not always prioritized. This may be frustrating for those who know better, but it's often done so that movies can focus on visuals or plot points instead.\nThat said, sometimes realism can help validate a film franchise's internal science. Keeping ideas rooted in reality — whether it's Newton's laws of motion or quantum mechanics — can add authenticity to a space movie. In turn, this can end up helping the plot. So, when real-life details are way off the mark, it can prove jarring for audiences. That's why experts have pointed out the scientific flaws in these space movies.\nIn a BuzzFeed video, astrophysicists Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling reviewed a scene from The Last Jedi during which an explosion occurs aboard a ship, sucking Princess Leia out of the hole the blast creates. The pair credited the film for successfully mimicking what would happen during an explosion like this — the exposure to space would pull back anyone and anything — but they noted that more people should have been sucked into the vacuum later on, when a door was opened nearby. Additionally, the experts confirmed that the frost forming on Leia's face was plausible but that her eyes functioning normally was unrealistic.\nRhodes and Kiessling also reviewed a scene from Guardians of the Galaxy, during which Peter Quill exits a spacecraft in order to save Gamora, who is floating in space. Peter removes his helmet and exposes his face, which Kiessling noted wasn't accurate. \"His eyes are still working; they would have frozen instantly,\" Kiessling said. Additionally, once Peter and Gamora are back in a pressurized space, they're immediately fine with no real side effects of their exposure to space. This could be attributed to Gamora's inhuman qualities and Peter's godly parentage, but the science behind this scene is inaccurate from a real-life standpoint. \nRelated: NASA Astronaut Explains What GOTG 3 Got Wrong About Star-Lord Almost Dying In Space\nTo add to this, astronaut Chris Hadfield shared in a 2023 Vanity Fair video discussing the second sequel that \"beyond about a minute and a half there's going to be stuff that happens to you that does permanent, irreversible, and deathly damage [when outside a spaceship without a space suit].\" He explained that because one would expel oxygen, they would essentially have blood with no oxygen. Once that blood reached the brain, they'd become unconscious.\nWhile Wall-E is a beloved and acclaimed movie from Disney and Pixar, it's not necessarily revered for its scientific accuracy. Discussing a scene where Wall-E and EVE are floating around in space, Kiessling explained, “There’s no atmosphere to carry the sound in space,” even though audiences can hear Wall-E and EVE speaking to each other and making noises. Additionally, Rhodes noted that while Wall-E pushing himself with a fire extinguisher is plausible, the precise direction and steering he exhibits while doing it is incorrect. According to Kiessling, “That level of control would not be possible.”\nWhile gunfights aren't the first thing most think of when it comes to astronauts and space, Total Recall is jam-packed with action that requires it. In a scene where Douglas Quaid shoots a firearm, he moves backwards. Rhodes explained that \"unless you are shooting the gun from exactly your center of gravity, instead of just moving in one direction, you would start to spin.\" So, while the scene showcases backward movement accurately as a result of the pressure released when firing, it doesn't account for the physics of shooting at the level of gravity Douglas finds himself in.\nAlthough guns are not unheard of in space, especially in fiction, the way they function is different there. Hadfield told Vanity Fair, \"Guns don't need oxygen to work. It's the exploding gas inside the confines of the rifle that make the projectile come out the end really fast.\" Because there's about one-sixth gravity on the moon, the bullet's fall is slower than on Earth, so it takes longer to hit its target. \"That means the bullet with the same speed horizontally would go further around the moon,\" said Hadfield. During a shootout in the film, however, the speed of the bullets seems to match that of bullets fired on Earth.\nRELATED: Why Passengers' Ending Was So Controversial\nThe same chase scene's shootout also uses diegetic sound to heighten the action, yet the lack of air on the moon makes it so that sound wouldn't carry like that. Additionally, astrophysicist Adam Frank shared in an NBCNews piece that the film's correlation between time, supposed low gravity, and space travel is incorrect, as Roy's three-month journey to Neptune requires constant movement. He explained this as follows:\n\"To get to Neptune that fast, the ship’s engines would have to be running the whole time, meaning Pitt would experience “gravity” because the acceleration produced by his rocket motors (what’s called thrust) would push his back into his chair (or his feet onto the floor).\"\nHadfield discussed how, for the sake of compelling storytelling, Passengers is inaccurate in its portrayal of centrifugal force and gravity. \"If you shut off the spinner [that simulates gravity for the spacecraft], it would continue to spin for quite a while,\" Hadfield said. That's mostly because there's \"nothing to slow the spin down.\" However, in Passengers, when the ship stops spinning instantly, everything starts floating due to zero gravity. Hadfield noted that to achieve this effect, the ship would actually need brakes of some sort.\nAurora swims when this happens, causing water to react to the lack of gravity. Hadfield went on to explain that water typically floats and naturally forms into a ball due to surface tension. While he applauded this aspect of the scene, he emphasized that the resolution is less likely. It would require a lot of force to get the ship spinning again in order to send the water back down once gravity was restored. However, in the movie, it's instantaneous and used to create tension when Aurora is finally able to resurface and take a big breath.\nRhodes and Kiessling agreed that there was little realism in Gravity in terms of science. For the movie to be accurate, Rhodes admitted that Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone \"would've died in every scene.\" Hadfield echoed that sentiment in the Vanity Fair video as he analyzed the scene where astronauts are caught in an asteroid debris field while repairing the Hubble telescope. He mentioned that the movie's representation of astronauts is \"so different from the people who are actually exploring space,\" citing oddities like Matthew contacting Houston when Ryan is propelled into space, Ryan’s frantic uncertainty about what to do when there’s an issue, and their recreational trips outside their spacecraft.\nRelated: The 15 Best Movies About Being Lost In Space\nHadfield criticized the premise of Life, calling it \"farfetched\" and expressing that, despite Ryan Reynolds' consideration for weightlessness, there are numerous improbabilities. Hadfield said in the 2023 Vanity Fair video that one of three main crises on a spaceship or space station is a fire. So, when Reynolds' character fills up the spaceship with fire and no alarms go off, it's unrealistic. Additionally, the use of an oxygen candle, which has \"a certain chemical in it that if you heat up one end, the chemical reaction releases great amounts of oxygen,\" as a means to eradicate the alien on the ship is undermined by the destructive use of a flamethrower.\nWhile The Martian may be scientifically accurate in some ways, such as Mark Watney's resourcefulness with food, it does contain some dubious science. Hadfield explained that Mars' atmosphere is extremely thin, which is \"the worst part of the whole movie.\" So, in the scene when Mark is tossed around due to a storm, it's unlikely that the large debris pieces would be picked up, blown, or used to knock Mark over. Hadfield elaborated that, because of the thinner atmosphere, \"there'd be so few air molecules going by, that you'd hardly even feel them.\"\nMoreover, the film's mirroring of Earth's gravity with Mars' is also inaccurate. Hadfield shared that Mars' gravity is 38% of Earth's, meaning that \"[Mark would] only weigh one third as much as he does on Earth.\" This indicates that the solidity of Mark's movements and his physique throughout his isolation on Mars are too far from what traversing and living on Mars is actually like.\nHadfield pointed out some issues with First Man, which is a movie about real astronaut Neil Armstrong's life. Like a few other entries on this list, First Man misuses sound in space. When Neil, played by Ryan Gosling, flies an X-15 aircraft in the opening scene, the sound is particularly inaccurate as Neil undergoes a test flight. Hadfield said, \"It's sort of like he's in a pickup truck, driving across a field with this big whiny noise that tells you just how fast he's going all the time.\" He goes on to say this would not be heard in a cockpit and that the extreme vibration is exaggerated.\nWhile space movies often take creative liberties, especially ones that lean more into science-fiction territory, the ones rooted in already-established science can sometimes be a bit too far off from reality.

{"title": "Marvel Secretly Killed Off the Spider-Verse Hero It Co-Owns with DC (Then Stole His Codename)", "date": "2023-10-04 23:01:44", "text": "Marvel and DC once merged to create Amalgam Comics, with Marvel deciding to kill their jointly owned Spider-Boy hero and then repurpose his name!\nMarvel and DC Comics once shared a comic book universe that brought together the best of both worlds by creating unique composite heroes and villains that fans couldn’t get enough of. And in an End of the Spider-Verse-related comic, The House of Ideas secretly killed off one of these hybrid heroes named Spider-Boy, only to turn around and repurpose his codename for a completely different superhero just recently introduced!\nCombining Ben Reilly’s Spider-Man and Connor Kent’s Superboy into Peter Ross aka Spider-Boy, this hero was one of the more visually appealing characters springing from 1996’s DC vs. Marvel comic event, as he perfectly blended Spidey’s more arachnid-focused outfit with Connor’s “bad boy” leather jacket design. Unfortunately for this version of Spider-Boy, Marvel decided he was better off dead, with the company not only brutally murdering him offscreen, but by the climax of the End of the Spider-Verse event, replacing him with another Spider-Boy, one that holds no ties to Marvel’s “Distinguished Competition.”\nRelated: Iron Man's Amalgam Armor Gave Him Green Lantern's Powers\nPermanently culling the jointly owned Spider-Boy in 2022’s Spider-Man #2, by Dan Slott and Mark Bagley, this issue acted as part two of the End of the Spider-Verse event and explained how the brutal spider-villain of Morlun traveled to another universe looking for a portal device that would allow him to traverse alternate realities more easily. Shown arriving in Loomworld holding the severed arm of a spider-person looking awfully similar to Spider-Boy’s leather-jacketed arm and spider-patterned glove, it’s heavily implied that Morlun killed this Spider-Man and used his device for his own means, effectively erasing a character from Marvel continuity that hasn’t been seen in almost 30 years.\nTossing the dismembered arm to the side now that the OG Spider-Boy’s usefulness had run its course, it’s here where Marvel’s secret elimination of this hero gives way to an all-new, all-different Spider-Boy named Bailey Briggs, adding further insult to injury as the character is officially introduced in the finale to the very story that offed his Amalgam counterpart in the first place. Making perfect sense to kill the first Spider-Boy as Marvel couldn’t feature him in full for this event nor any other comic story due to the understandably tricky legal issues with DC, Bailey inheriting the Spider-Boy moniker is an inspired choice that simultaneously dashes any lingering hopes of seeing the Ben Reilly/Connor Kent version of the character pop up in the Spider-Verse ever again.\nSo while it was already unlikely Marvel or DC would have utilized their shared characters again after the epic event that brought them together concluded, seeing the sneaky way Marvel did away with the Amalgam Universe’s Spider-Boy only to reintroduce the character as a Marvel-owned sidekick is not only a slick way to go about removing Spider-Boy from the overarching conversation, but also acts as the final “appearance” of this hybrid hero entirely. Marvel’s composite Spider-Boy is dead, and although he technically lives on, it’s unfortunately in name only.\nBrian is first and foremost a nerd in every way shape and form. He likes to compare himself to a black hole, consuming any and every form of entertainment unlucky enough to get caught in his gravitational pull.

{"title": "90 Day: The Last Resort: Is Angela's Age Affecting Her? ( Maybe It's A Midlife Crisis)", "date": "2023-10-04 22:52:15", "text": "90 Day: The Last Resort's Angela Deem often runs hot or cold. She's moody, erratic, explosive, and possibly going through a midlife crisis. \n90 Day: The Last Resort star Angela Deem's erratic and out of control, and since she's now 57, her age may be changing her personality. Since she's one of the more mature 90DF franchise stars, the fact that Angela still lashes out like an angry child's surprising. Fame may have gone to her head, stalling her personal growth. Sometimes shockingly immature, Angela said onscreen that she finds it hard to express herself with words. Over the years, she's proven that's true. Once, in a fit of rage, she threw a strawberry shortcake at Michael Ilesanmi. She hasn't calmed down much since then.\nRight now, on 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, Angela's in a good place with Michael, but based on their turbulent history, their happiness may not last. Onscreen, she just celebrated her third anniversary with Michael, albeit virtually. Even via video, Michael was able to excite his much-older partner. Just the sight of Michael makes her, \"cooter tingle.\" While there's nothing wrong with a mature woman having a libido, Angela's signature TMI's just another example of how she goes for shock value. Does she fear getting older and try to compensate with wild behavior? Or is she just enjoying her life?\nRelated: 90 Day Fiancé's Angela Deem Confirms If She Actually Loves Michael Ilesanmi\nAngela's known for reckless conduct, and that's a key indicator of a midlife crisis. On 90 Day: The Last Resort, she flirted with a resort worker while holding divorce papers in her hand. She knows she's acting up while the cameras roll, and that may provoke her to try and one-up herself. While that could explain certain histrionics, with or without 90 Day Fiancé's Michael Ilesanmi, some of it may be the byproduct of aging.\nAngela may not realize that a midlife crisis is driving her behavior... and pushing her to go way too far. Self-examination isn't exactly her strong suit, and that's why she's such an interesting addition to the 90 Day: The Last Resort cast. The show's about therapy, and the extrovert Angela prefers to act out, rather than looking within.\nAngela leaned into her \"wild woman\" persona long ago. On 90 Day: The Last Resort, she's trying to change. This attempt to \"soften\" her personality may not stick, and it may be a sign that she's currently confused about her identity. A person who's having a midlife crisis may find that their sense of self's shakier. They're changing due to aging, and may have trouble reconciling who they are now with who they were in the past.\nDoes Angie still want to be the wild woman? Or is she looking for personal growth that makes her a more serene person? Right now, she's waffling. It's possible that part of her is truly open to change. However, change is hard, especially for a reality celeb who might bore viewers if she calmed down too much. Angela's savvy enough to understand why people are watching. All she really needs to do is be herself without hurting anyone else. If she's authentic, but not getting into physical altercations, she can weather her midlife crisis without serious repercussions.\nIt's unrealistic to expect a lot of maturity from Angela, but sometimes, she's underestimated. She worked in palliative care, at a hospice. That's the kind of work that requires endless empathy and compassion. Also, she's there for her family through thick and thin. Since she does have a lot of different sides to her personality, it may be hard for her to balance her mature and more \"out there\" traits. As she gets older, it could get easier. Sometimes, people \"age out\" of certain things. That may happen to the Georgia peach from Hazlehurst.\nNot too long ago, Angela got into a brawl with a \"pal.\" They fought in a hotel elevator, and Angie seemed to be the aggressor. She gets angry too fast, and never stops to think. In her relationship with Michael, she's been aggressive too. Does irritability lead her to attack? She overreacts to things, and Angela's so easily triggered. While there are good reasons why she's been upset with Michael, as he's an admitted cheater, she chose to stay with him. If a person chooses to stay, they should try to honestly forgive. Angela holds grudges, and midlife irritability may make it even harder for her to hold back.\nShe didn't get cast in 90 Day: The Last Resort because she's a serene woman. She's there because she's a hothead and her marriage is hanging by a thread. While she seems to love Michael, if she's having a midlife crisis, it may be hard for her to keep things on an even keel, like they were in the last episode.\nAngela has talked to therapists on the show, so she's trying. She and Michael are currently happy, but the real issue may be more serious than a midlife crisis. The underlying problem is that Michael may not be sincere. Does he really love Angela? While he's putting on a good show during the 90DF spinoff, a cheater who has repeatedly betrayed his partner may not reform. He could pretend to be different for personal gain.\nFor reality TV show star Michael, there are benefits to staying with Angela. There's money in it, and clout too. Without Angela, where would he be? She suspected he was a scammer, and those doubts may have been something she could have paid more attention to. Instead, she wasted years on Michael. If he doesn't actually love her, it's all so pointless.\nTrying to make things work with Michael may exacerbate any midlife crisis symptoms she's having, and those efforts could ultimately be futile. A \"happy\" spinoff episode doesn't mean long-term happiness. It's quite likely that the problems she's had with Michael will resurface, and when they do, her coping skills may not be good as they are right now on 90 Day: The Last Resort. In the tropical locale, everything may seem solvable, but when the cameras stop filming, life can be very different. Michael and Angela are like oil and water, and making them mix requires enormous effort, which is unlikely to be worth it in the end.\n"}

Many of the best movies of all time come from the crime genre, including classics like The Godfather and Goodfellas. The crime film genre has only grown over the years, and this has prompted heavy competition between streaming services to acquire the rights to classics and produce new hits in this area.\nNetflix has done a good job of balancing its volume of classic crime movies and its production of new films of this type, leading to a strong overall selection. While Netflix's catalog is in a state of constant change, its current roster of crime movies is excellent, which reflects the company's efforts to stay stocked up on this popular genre.\nRelated: 10 Best Mystery Movies On Netflix\nThe Irishman is one of the biggest Netflix originals ever, earning numerous accolades, including an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.

The veracity of Abagnale's claims has been widely challenged, but the story he tells is fascinating regardless. This is another Spielberg masterpiece, so it's worth a watch for Netflix subscribers.\nDespite its initial criticisms for being overly violent, Scarface is now considered one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. Scarface stars Al Pacino as Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as he rises to become one of the most powerful drug lords in Miami.

{"title": "Reptile: Why Judy Puts Tom's Hand In Wax", "date": "2023-10-04 22:40:38", "text": "Benecio Del Toro's new movie Reptile includes a confusing scene where Judy puts Tom's hand into a wax bath without much explanation or context. \nWARNING! This article contains SPOILERS for Reptile (2023)!\nJudy putting Tom's hand in wax at the end of Reptile plays an important part in the thriller's conclusion, but the scene's inclusion is largely unexplained by the 2023 movie. In director Grant Singer's feature-film debut, a detective named Tom Nichols (Benicio del Toro) must work to track down a killer after a young real estate agent named Summer is killed. However, his investigation causes him to unravel all the truths he believes about his life and the institutions he's involved in.\nThis crime thriller – led by Benicio del Toro, Alicia Silverstone, and Justin Timberlake – was released in theaters on September 22 before arriving on Netflix to a mixed critical response. While Del Toro offers a compelling performance, Reptile is frustratingly uneven and much of its plot is confusing. One such perplexing scene in Reptile is when Judy dips Tom's hand in wax and then peels it off; however, there's both a health and symbolic reason for this action.\nRelated: Reptile Cast & Character Guide\nWhile it seems extremely random at first, there's a practical reason for Judy dipping Tom's hand in the wax at the end of Reptile. By this point in the movie, Tom's cut on his hand has healed, but he still feels the impact of this injury. However, paraffin wax therapy offers numerous health benefits that could help Tom's recovery. According to Healthline, paraffin wax baths can increase blood flow, decrease inflammation, relax the muscles, reduce muscle spasms, and lessen pain. By engaging in paraffin wax therapy, Tom hopes to experience less impairment due to his hand injury.\nRelated: Where Was Reptile Filmed? Thriller Movie's Filming Locations Explained\nTom Nichols deals with a hand injury that bothers him throughout Reptile, with this cut representing the physical and psychological toll that the investigation takes on the detective. However, by Reptile's ending, Tom wraps up the investigation and finds the killer, just as he wraps up his hand and prepares for recovery. Additionally, he copes with the inner turmoil of learning that the people he trusted act in corrupt and harmful ways. The wax scene combines the character's background with Reptile's title in order to send a powerful message about healing.\nSnakes, a type of reptile, shed their skin because the outer layer is old, worn, and doesn't fit anymore, which also helps rid them of harmful parasites. This biological process provides insight into the significance of the paraffin wax at the end of Reptile. After going through the investigation, Tom is worn and weathered due to the emotional turmoil. However, he has changed his relationships and beliefs, making him a different person internally. Tom metaphorically sheds his skin in Reptile by removing the wax layer and becoming a new person. Moreover, Judy's involvement proves that she recognizes his mental changes.\nSource: Healthline\nDani Kessel Odom (they/them) works as a Core Features Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Coolest Iron Man Armors Tony Stark Built for Other Heroes", "date": "2023-10-04 22:31:41", "text": "Every one of Tony Stark's Iron Man suits are better than the last, and that extends to other heroes who have worn them. Here are the Top 10 coolest! \nIt’s no secret that Tony Stark has created some absolutely jaw-dropping pieces of tech throughout his Marvel Comics history, including and especially his legion of Iron Man suits. While fans have seen Stark donning pretty much every variation of Iron Man armor he’s crafted for himself, they’ve also seen the ones he’s made for other people, and those suits are equally awesome.\nTony Stark doesn’t have any superpowers aside from his inherent brilliance. This means that he relies on his increasingly impressive Iron Man suits to keep up with the likes of Captain Marvel, Thor, or the Hulk. This also means that Stark pretty much has a monopoly on such super-suits in the meta-sense, as they are Tony Stark's unique path towards super-heroism that becomes cheapened with every copy. Technically anyone who wears an Iron Man suit immediately gains all of Iron Man’s powers (minus the inherent intelligence, anyway), so it makes sense that Marvel Comics doesn’t give everyone who isn’t as strong as Captain Marvel or Thor an Iron Man suit. That being said, there have been a few occasions where Iron Man has shared his tech with those around him, and in such occasions, the results were phenomenal. Here are the Top 10 coolest Iron Man armors Tony Stark built for other heroes!\nJames “Rhodey” Rhodes is someone who’s been a significant part of Tony Stark’s life since his debut in Iron Man #118 by David Michelinie, Bob Layton, and John Byrne, even so far as taking up the Iron Man mantle in Iron Man #170. However, Rhodey wouldn’t become a hero in his own right until Avengers West Coast #94, which is when he made his official debut as War Machine. Designed by Tony Stark, the War Machine armor is incredibly reminiscent of the classic Iron Man suit (which Rhodey was familiar with), except it was decked-out with massive weapons and reinforced armor for extra security and power. This is the longest-lasting suit Tony made for another hero, and is easily one of the most significant.\nTony Stark made Black Widow an Iron Man suit on two separate occasions - in two separate universes. The first was in the Ultimate Universe, as shown in Ultimates 2 #4 by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch. Tony Stark gifted Black Widow her own ‘Iron Maiden’ armor that was stylistically similar to his own, though fully blacked-out in color. Over in the prime Marvel Comics universe of Earth-616 (specifically in Avengers #28 by Jason Aaron and Ed McGuinness), Iron Man designs Black Widow a suit that’s more akin to War Machine armor, though a bit more sleek and with specialty designs that made it stand out as a Black Widow suit - and that armor was dubbed the War Widow.\nIn the Iron Cat series (by Jed MacKay and Père Perez), Tony Stark builds Felicia Hardy aka Black Cat her own Iron Cat armor. Visually, the armor looks more or less identical to Tony’s classic Iron Man design, with the addition of energy claws on the suit’s fingertips, a black mask-like design around the eyes, and cat ears that sit atop the armor’s helmet. This is the first suit on this list that didn’t grant someone with no superhuman powers all the abilities of Iron Man, but rather enhanced the preexisting superhuman abilities of the established hero. The Iron Cat complemented Black Cat’s aesthetic and powerset, while still looking and feeling like an Iron Man suit.\nBrian Braddock, or Captain Britain in Earth-616, was just a regular human in the universe in which he wore a version of the Mark 1 Iron Man suit as shown in What If? X-Men Age of Apocalypse #1 by Rick Remender and Dave Wilkins. In that alternate universe of Earth-93074, Braddock wears the original Iron Man suit, but rather than it being all gray, it is covered in the Union Jack. This armor was designed by the Tony Stark of this reality, but seemed more like repurposed armor than a specifically designed gift, though it was enough to make Braddock a formidable hero.\nWhile Luke Cage is probably the last person who would need the protection of a suit of armor given his powerset, he didn’t say ‘no’ to the offensive upgrades that came with his very own Iron Man suit. In fact, the style of the suit itself reflects that, as it is very minimal with only the necessary placements of armor on Cage’s body that offer superhuman enhancements, like gauntlets for energy blasts, boots for flight, and a helmet to navigate/pinpoint targets. This suit was featured in the Venomverse: War Stories #1 story “Force Majeure” by Aaron Covington and Khary Randolph, where Luke Cage used it to face off against Doctor Doom.\nIn Marvel Comics’ Empyre event by Al Ewing, Dan Slott, and Valerio Schiti, Tony Stark made Reed Richards his own Iron Man suit, complete with Mister Fantastic’s usual costume color scheme and the Fantastic Four insignia on the chest. This entry is especially entertaining, as Reed was very reluctant to wear one of Tony Stark’s suits, but was forced to in a last-ditch effort to save the world. This suit is a cool addition to Fantastic Four canon (as well as Reed Richards’ wardrobe).\nPerhaps the most iconic suit made but not worn by Tony Stark is the Iron Spider Armor, which was created specifically for Spider-Man and made its debut in The Amazing Spider-Man #529 by J. Michael Straczynski and Ron Garney. Similar to the suit made for Black Cat, the Iron Spider Armor complimented Spider-Man’s powers and enhanced them in creative and useful ways - including the extra mechanical arms. This suit not only enhanced Spider-Man’s powers and gave some variety to his many costumes, but it also was a standout aspect of the entire Civil War event.\nThis entry is the purest example of Tony building a suit of armor to protect someone he loves, rather than attack his enemies. Stark made the Rescue Armor specifically for Pepper Potts, who found the specialty suit in Invincible Iron Man #10 by Matt Fraction and Salvador Larroca. It was called the ‘Rescue Armor’ due to the fact that Rescue was Pepper’s superhero codename while wearing the suit. However, the undertones of Tony building the armor for Pepper in an attempt to ‘rescue’ her from the dangers of the world surrounding them is clearly present, making this suit especially significant.\nWhile Tony Stark is a master in developing his unique style of high-tech suit, he ventured into the realm of anime mechs for one storyline, as these suits were more akin to those featured in popular anime series like Vultron or Neon Genesis Evangelion. As shown in Avengers: Mech Strike by Jed MacKay and Carlos Magno, Iron Man developed gigantic mech-suits for every member of the Avengers, transforming Earth’s Mightiest Heroes into the world’s most technologically advanced protectors in truly epic (and undeniably awesome) fashion.\nSimilar to the above entry, this one shows Iron Man using his technological genius to create robotic Avengers. The difference, however, is that the so-called Iron Avengers are immeasurably darker than the Mech Strike Avengers. The Mech Strike Avengers were the core team each with their own fun, giant robot fighter that displayed their logo and costume. The Iron Avengers, however, was a sick attempt at replacing the Avengers with hollow suits of armor that pale in comparison to the originals. In Earth X #1 by Alex Ross, Jim Krueger, and John Paul Leon, the Avengers are dead, and Iron Man attempts to replace them with robots of his own design. This entry is admittedly less of a suit built for someone, and rather a legion of suits built to replace a whole team of 'someones', making the Iron Avengers the most extreme (and sick) example on this list.\nFrom giving his friends and allies an extra power-boost in battle and protecting the ones he loves with a personally-made suit of armor, to literally building an entire Avengers-level mech-squad, it’s easy to see how these are the Top 10 coolest Iron Man armors Tony Stark has built for other heroes.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

Both movies are set to premiere on October 6, with The Exorcist: Believer, a legacy sequel about two possessed girls who must be helped by original Exorcist character Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), set to debut theatrically in wide release. Totally Killer, which follows a teenager (Kiernan Shipka) being transported back in time to 1987 and trying to save her mother's friends from a serial killer, will be released as a streaming exclusive on Prime Video.\nJust a few days before the official Exorcist: Believer release date, the possession movie debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a startlingly low score of 26% at the time of writing. Totally Killer, which also has a new score on Rotten Tomatoes, completely blows the legacy sequel out of the water. Although both scores are due to fluctuate as more reviews are added over the weekend, the slasher comedy is currently more than 50% higher than the other title with a thoroughly Fresh score of 81%.\nWhile this sharp divide between the movies' Rotten Tomatoes scores is surprising, Blumhouse is nevertheless set to dominate the lead-up to Halloween this year. The Fresh score may help boost Totally Killer's profile this weekend for streaming audiences, but the low score for The Exorcist: Believer may not tarnish its ability to draw theatrical viewers. At the time of writing, the Exorcist: Believer box office is still projected to take in an opening weekend of a possible franchise-best $30-$35 million.\nWith these titles set to dominate both theatrical and at-home viewership during the first weekend in October, Blumhouse is kicking off what should prove to be a very fruitful Halloween season. Because Saw X opened slightly earlier on September 29, the month only has one other major wide release horror movie on the schedule. That would be the buzzy video game adaptation Five Nights at Freddy's, which is set to premiere on October 27.\nBecause Five Nights at Freddy's is also a Blumhouse production, it cements in the company's domination over the horror genre during its most important season. Even if the The Exorcist: Believer release comes in below expectations, horror-hungry audiences will have plenty of other Blumhouse options to choose from this month. The Totally Killer Rotten Tomatoes score is merely the cherry on top of what promises to be a robust period at the movies.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes\n"}

This indicates the trilogy may not have the same creative team as the Netflix series.\nWhile Barry will not be involved in the upcoming movies, executive producer Dean English will be returning to bring the new installments to life. However, it's now unclear if the films will follow Barry's original vision for Warrior Nun season 3 and beyond, or if the series will go in a different direction. It also calls into question which members of the cast and crew from the original show will be returning.\nThe end of Warrior Nun season 2 saw Ava go through the Ark in order to heal in Reya's dimension as Beatrice quit the OCS. Lilith also hinted at a looming holy war, which may pit the OCS against a new threat. It appears the upcoming movie trilogy will continue the story from the end of season 2, though it remains to be seen how it will unfold.\nWhile English's involvement is a good sign for the film trilogy, Barry stepping away could be a worrisome development for the future of the franchise. However, nothing is certain about where the series will go from here until more information about the movies gets revealed. For now, Warrior Nun fans whose ardent campaigning saved the series will have to wait and see.\nSource: Simon Barry/Twitter\n"}

Although Gen V seems to follow a self-contained story in The Boys' universe, it has been dropping several subtle hints that could become major plot points in the franchise's overarching storylines. For instance, Gen V hints that Homelander is already on trial after he killed a man in broad daylight in The Boys' season 3. This revelation alone sets the stage for many narrative avenues for The Boys season 4.\nBy highlighting how Brink offers Luke a place in The Seven, Gen V also confirms that Starlight and Maeve's departure from the supe group has left two empty spots for new supes to fill. However, besides these evident references and story setups, Gen V also secretly reveals how one weapon can be used to overpower any supe. The spin-off show's depiction of the weapon and its impact on supes almost confirms that even Homelander would not stand a chance against it.\nRELATED: Gen V Continues An Episode 1 Tradition The Boys Has Followed For 3 Seasons\nA sonic weapon generates high-intensity sound waves that may not be lethal but can cause severe damage to a targeted individual. Most supes not only possess special powers but also have advanced senses that complement their unique abilities. Owing to this, they are more sensitive to the extreme frequencies and amplitudes of high-intensity sounds, leaving them vulnerable to the detrimental effects of sonic weapons. Gen V establishes this in its opening episodes, where Andre fails to stand his ground against a non-supe human who uses a tiny device that generates high-intensity sounds.\nDespite his best efforts to fight back, Andre falls to the ground, struggling to get up because his augmented hearing enhances his auditory perception and prevents his ears from filtering out the sound from the weapon. The fact that the human guard seems unscathed by the sound from his sonic weapon shows how sound waves that non-supe folks can comfortably hear can cause severe damage in supes like Andre. Although Gen V explicitly portrays how augmented hearing is the Achilles heel for many supes, The Boys has previously hinted at this weakness.\nIn The Boys' season 2, episode 8, \"What I Know,\" Frenchie intentionally sets up a loud sonic weapon to distract Homelander while Butcher and Becca rescue Ryan. A regular sound would not have bothered Homelander. However, when he hears the sound waves from the weapon, he instantly flies out to destroy it, proving that Gen V's sonic weapon would also be effective against Homelander. This Gen V revelation not only proves that Homelander has a clear weakness but also highlights how Supersonic was literally a walking weapon against several supes in The Boys and could even kill Homelander with his Sonic Clap powers.\n"}
{"title": "Castlevania: Nocturne Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-04 22:00:38", "text": "From the return of a beloved Castlevania character to Erzsebet Báthory’s plan, here is Castlevania: Nocturne season 1’s ending explained.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Castlevania: Nocturne.\nFrom Alucard’s return to the Erzsebet Báthory’s plan, Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8 concluded the season with major twists and set up a potential season 2. Castlevania: Nocturne followed Richter Belmont, a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, in a story set 300 years after the original show. After several mentions of the Vampire Messiah and her twisted goals, Castlevania: Nocturne ended with the vampires achieving a major victory, but not all hope was lost.\nAlucard returned in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8, bringing Netflix’s Castlevania franchise full circle and setting up the next chapter in Richter’s story. While Alucard looked different in Castlevania: Nocturne, this is the same character from the original show. Alucard’s actor was not initially listed as part of Castlevania: Nocturne’s cast, which helped keep the character’s return a surprise. Tera has been turned into a vampire, Richter can now use magic again, and Annette learns that Edouard’s soul has a new purpose. Here is a breakdown of the Castlevania: Nocturne ending, and how it sets up season 2.\nAlucard is the son of Dracula in the world of Castlevania. He was introduced at the end of Castlevania season 1, episode 1, and went on to become one of the show’s main characters. While the Castlevania franchise is focused on the Belmont family, Alucard is a huge part of that universe, both in the games and the Netflix adaptation. Born to a vampire father and a human mother, Alucard is somewhat immortal. Dracula’s son does not age, which makes him the perfect character to bridge Castlevania and Castlevania: Nocturne. Alucard fought side by side with Trevor Belmont in the original series and now appeared to help Richter in Nocturne.\nAlucard is one of the most powerful beings in the Castlevania universe, which is why he did not even struggle to kill Drolta. Alucard’s sword, which he can command from a distance through magic, quickly puts an end to one of the strongest vampires in Nocturne. Alucard’s return in Castlevania: Nocturne’s ending was very much a sequel hook for a potential Castlevania: Nocturne season 2, which has yet to be confirmed by Netflix. Richter, Annette, and Maria have not saved the world from Erzsebeth Báthory, but fortunately, Alucard is now joining them. As the son of Dracula put it, though, he was a bit late.\nWhile Castlevania: Nocturne is connected to Castlevania, the show did not have too many direct connections to the original series. This is because Castlevania: Nocturne is set 300 years after Castlevania, meaning most of the characters audiences followed in the first show have been long dead by now. Richter Belmont is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha, both of whom were Alucard’s best friends. The Castlevania trio was the heart of the show, and both Trevor and Sypha left a huge mark on Alucard’s long life. This is why the son of Dracula was expected to appear in Castlevania: Nocturne eventually.\nRelated: Castlevania: Nocturne Is Based On These 2 Games (But With One Fundamental Change)\nThanks to Alucard appearing in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8, the show is now directly tied to its predecessor. While names like Sypha and Dracula were mentioned in Castlevania: Nocturne, the animated series did not focus on things that had happened in the first Castlevania show. Now that Alucard has joined the heroes, there may be more mentions of Trevor and Sypha in a potential Castlevania season 2. In addition, Alucard’s return sets the stage for Dracula to come into play, even though Vlad Tepes had a happy ending with Lisa in Castlevania season 4’s finale. Regardless, Alucard will be an important ally in the fight against Erzsebet Báthory.\nCastlevania season 4’s ending saw both Dracula and Lisa being resurrected. While those behind their resurrection planned on transforming Dracula and Lisa into the Rebus, the heroes managed to stop the creature before it was too late. Dracula and Lisa, now back in the world of the living, were free again. Castlevania ends with Dracula and Lisa hugging each other, suggesting they had a happy ending away from all the pain and misery from their original lives. Castlevania: Nocturne suggests Dracula as a monster that hasn’t been seen for hundreds of years, and there are even those who do not even know who Dracula is.\nThe main Castlevania: Nocturne villain was Erzsebeth Báthory, who is described by her followers as the Vampire Messiah. Erzsebeth, who believes herself to be a goddess, plans to create an endless night in which vampires will no longer have to hide from the sunlight. However, Erzsebeth also wanted to forge a symbolic ally with humans, particularly with the Abbot and the Catholic Church. The final stop in Erzsebet’s plan was to take on a human sacrifice inside the church to cement her powers and officially begin her rule. The Devourer of Light originally planned on taking Maria as a sacrifice, but plans changed after Tera, Maria’s mom, offered herself instead.\nTera, who had already been a victim of the Devourer of Light, offered herself as a sacrifice to save her daughter. Tera, who is a Speaker, argued that she would make for a far more powerful vampire than her daughter. While Erzsebet hesitated, the Vampire Messiah eventually agreed to replace Maria with her mother. This is why Tera stayed behind in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8. Maria’s mom was bitten and turned into a vampire before Richter and the others had even left the church. While this was a tragic turn of events, Tera managed to save her daughter after the child’s father, Abbot Emanuel, almost got her killed.\nCastlevania: Nocturne’s season finale directly sets up season 2. Similar to the original Castlevania show, most of the conflicts were not resolved at the end of season 1, which mainly served to introduce characters and plot points for future stories. This includes the return of Alucard, who killed Dracula in Castlevania season 2 and now joins the fight against the Vampire Messiah. Tera’s future as a vampire will also be an important storyline in a potential Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. In addition, Castlevania: Nocturne has only now begun to show Richter Belmont’s powers and skills, as the character could not use magic for most of season 1.\nCastlevania: Nocturne’s final episodes also hinted at a relationship between Richter and Annette, which happens in the games. While this could only be a nod to their video game counterparts’ history, this potential relationship could be revisited in Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. Lastly, The Devour of Light essentially won in episode 8, having accomplished her goal of turning a sacrifice into a vampire inside a church. Erzsebet Báthory’s plan of world domination continues, meaning there are more than enough stories for Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 to tackle.\n"}
{"title": "Jujutsu Kaisen Will Force Its Heroes To Fight Without Their Strongest Ally", "date": "2023-10-04 22:00:38", "text": "After the most recent episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen's Shibuya Incident arc, the series' protagonists won't be able to rely on their most powerful ally.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #9Despite facing arguably their biggest threat yet, Jujutsu Kaisen is now forcing its heroes to fight on without their greatest ally Gojo after a shocking twist in the anime's latest episode. This makes sense from a narrative perspective as Gojo was powerful enough to trivialize most threats in the series on his own, but it is still surprising given his extreme power level and popularity.\nIn Season 2 Episode #9 of Jujutsu Kaisen, the curses were able to enact their ultimate plan to stop Gojo from interfering with them. After tiring the sorcerer out by forcing him to kill a slew of transfigured humans quickly, Geto showed up with a mysterious item known as the Prison Realm. This box was able to capture Gojo as long as he was incapacitated for a mental minute, which Geto's shocking arrival enabled. Despite Gojo's immense power, once he was trapped by the Prison Realm, it seemed he was powerless to escape, even as the villain taunted him, which shows that the other heroes of the story will now have to fight on without him.\nThis is an incredibly tall order especially given the power level of the enemies they must face in Shibuya. While Gojo was able to easily defeat Hanami in that episode, the other Disaster Curses are still free to wreak havoc on a massive scale, and each one has a devastating ability. Jogo can wield massive amounts of firepower, Mahito can transfigure humans with one touch, and the newest introduction Choso appears to be able to manipulate blood. This isn't even including the sorcerer controlling Geto's body, who can call forth several potent other curses to fight at his disposal. These villains are also incredibly disturbing in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime, meaning there is no moral limit on what they might do.\nWith all these powerful threats against them, the good sorcerers will likely be hard-pressed to bring the Shibuya Incident to a happy conclusion. There are many powerful sorcerers in the series besides Gojo, but they are all separated among various teams and none of them are as untouchable. Gojo's Limitless technique granted him both powerful offensive and defensive techniques, and no other sorcerer could match that level of versatility. This leaves them with clear weaknesses that the Curses can exploit, which means that a fair amount of them will likely get killed or extremely injured.\nGojo's sealing represents a major status quo change for the series. Before this point, sorcerers could rely on Gojo to handle any enemy they deemed too dangerous, which gave them a bit of a crutch when dealing with dangerous Curses. Now this support is gone and the heroes of Jujutsu Kaisen must fight against the series' incredibly powerful enemies alone.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

The Help is an impeccable fighter, able to stand his ground against Batman. Since his original appearance, he’s been one of DC’s most dangerous combatants, and now he’s heading back to Gotham.\nThe Penguin #2 – by Tom King, Rafael de Latorre, and Marcelo Maiolo – finds Oswald Cobblepot working toward taking back his position in Gotham. Unable to do it alone, he seeks out the most powerful henchman in the world: the Help.\nThe Help has not only stood against Batman, he’s had a hand in training several other incredibly skilled fighters and heroes.\nThe Help was first introduced in Batman: Killing Time #3 – by Tom King, David Marquez, and Alejandro Sánchez – where he was hired by Penguin to settle his conflict with Riddler and Catwoman. Now, writer Tom King has brought the character back in The Penguin #2, once more as a reluctant associate of the Penguin. Killing Time #3 established the Help as the most skilled person in the fight immediately upon his entering the frat, as he shot Riddler and defeated Batman. Not only was he able to counter Batman’s moves, he named the tactics and their origin, explaining his own experiences with everyone from Ted Grant to Ras al Ghul.\nIn Killing Time #3, the Help gave a sense that the fight didn't require his full concentration; he had energy left over afterward to be complimentary toward Batman. The Penguin #2 offers further insight into the Help’s history. His students include Lady Shiva, widely regarded as the most lethal fighter in the world. As he and Penguin hunt on the grounds of his home, he mentions being employed by the Queens to train their son Oliver years earlier. Previously, he name-dropped Black Canary as a former trainee, meaning he’s had a hand in both Canary and Green Arrow’s origins. Nearly ninety years old, the Help exceeds Batman in both training and experience.\nAfter the events of Batman: Killing Time, during which he retrieved the incredibly valuable object known as the Eye of Christ, the Help retired, settling in to a life of luxury. Yet, in spite of his imposing skill as a fighter, Oswald Cobblepot was able to force the Help to join him in his campaign for criminal supremacy in Gotham. In The Penguin #2, the eponymous crime lord killed the Help's staff, citing being served and waited upon “wasn’t him.” Now, Cobblepot will take his rightful place in Gotham with Earth’s greatest henchman at his side – ensuring that whoever comes out on top, the Help or Batman, the Penguin may be the only winner.\nCheck out The Penguin #2, available now from DC Comics!\nAshley is a long-time comics nerd, a parent (to a human, a dog, and too many houseplants), and a big fan of all things dark and spooky.

{"title": "10 Great Movies Set At Halloween That Absolutely Aren't Horror Films", "date": "2023-10-04 21:50:37", "text": "Even though Halloween is closely associated with the horror genre, there are a few great movies set on Halloween night that aren't horror-related.\nWhile Halloween is the perfect time for scary movies, there are a few classic non-horror films that are also set on the holiday. Halloween is a time for the spooky and supernatural. The holiday is one of the few times of the year when it is acceptable to focus on ghoulish, macabre, and downright frightening subjects. This prompts many movie buffs to spend most of October celebrating Halloween by watching classic horror movies. However, it also means that the cinematic representation of the holiday is somewhat imbalanced.\nEven though Christmas is a time for family, friends, and peace on earth, there are a veritable deluge of horror movies, action thrillers, and bawdy comedies that subvert this tradition. By contrast, Halloween horror movies dominate the holiday's contributions to cinema. Almost every movie set on Halloween is a horror movie of some sort, whether it is as anodyne and family-friendly as Hocus Pocus or Halloweentown or as chilling as the classic slasher Halloween. Discounting movies with horror elements, there are surprisingly few scare-free movies set on Halloween night.\n2014’s Song of the Sea is a poignant, funny, and inventive Irish animated adventure movie. Although it's technically a fantasy adventure about selkies, much of Song of the Sea is a sweet cartoon dramedy about a pair of mismatched siblings getting into scrapes and coming to each other’s rescue. The most important plot points take place on Halloween night, but there is nothing horrifying about this fantasy movie’s ending. As inventive and charming as it is moving, Song of the Sea is a great animated movie that proves Disney and Studio Ghibli aren’t the only creative powerhouses in the industry.\nDirector Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial blends family drama, science-fiction, and comedy, but the movie steers clear of horror for the most part. Admittedly, some small children were likely afraid the first time they saw the eponymous alien sprint at the camera. However, it soon becomes clear that he is one of the cutest aliens in cinema history. Despite this, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’s entire story takes place on Halloween night, and the practice of trick-or-treating is central to the movie’s ending.\nThe Australian drama Boys in the Trees is a lyrical fantasy movie mixed with a coming-of-age story. Although it's far from a traditional horror movie, it is likely the most unsettling movie listed here. With a tone similar to Mike Flanagan’s Netflix shows, Boys in the Trees uses ghosts and spirits as metaphors for trauma and tragedy. However, these never feel forced or clumsy. Instead, this coming-of-age story manages to turn a tale of two friends drifting apart into something that is equal parts life-affirming and heartbreaking.\n2013’s Grow Up Tony Philips is a fascinating non-horror Halloween movie, as the coming-of-age dramedy is also the director’s first departure from the world of horror comedy. Director Emily Hagins is best known for beginning her career with the zombie movie Pathogen, which she directed at the ripe age of 12. However, Grow Up Tony Philips is a very different proposition. A dramedy about the titular antihero coming to terms with his friends growing out of their old Halloween traditions, Grow Up Tony Philips asks viewers what it means to grow up and what teenagers should be willing to sacrifice in the name of friendship.\nWhile Amazon’s Jack Reacher adaptation nailed the tone of the Lee Childs novel series, there is something to be said for the enjoyable silliness of 2016’s Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. This thriller is a classic Reacher adventure as Tom Cruise’s version of the heroic drifter races against time to clear the name of a framed friend. The action-thriller makes good use of the Halloween setting during its climax. While admittedly a by-the-numbers procedural, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is elevated by Cruise’s screen presence and some stylish action sequences that prove Halloween is a holiday woefully underutilized by the genre.\n1997’s Affliction is an intense, emotionally moving effort from indie director and Taxi Driver scribe Paul Schrader. Nick Nolte plays a small-town cop who becomes obsessed with a hunting death that took place on Halloween. He's convinced that it was a murder and that there is a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Like another popular movie no one talks about any more — Mystic River — this grim crime drama offers no easy answers. Dark, brutal, and believable, this soulful thriller might be a harder watch than many Halloween horror movies.\nIronweed tells the tale of a drifter suffering from an unspecified mental illness who returns to his hometown on Halloween night, but viewers shouldn’t be discouraged by this seemingly dark synopsis. Where the superficially similar Spider and Possum mine this setup for nightmarish journeys into broken psyches, Ironweed instead offers a warm, elegiac, and at times, surprisingly sweet story of love and loss. Jack Nicholson is stellar as ever as the troubled lead, but it is Meryl Streep’s spirited turn as his dying old friend that makes Ironweed essential viewing.\nWhile Clint Eastwood is one of the best Western movie directors of all time, he is also accomplished when it comes to smaller, more intimate stories. A Perfect World is one of these, as Eastwood’s camera follows a convict and a sheltered orphan on the run across the U.S. Surprisingly moving, A Perfect World's plot centers around a touching moment where the movie’s troubled anti-hero helps his shy new friend celebrate Halloween for the first time.\n1976’s Kenny and Company was largely overshadowed by director Don Coscarelli’s next effort, Phantasm. However, as a tribute to misspent youth, this 1976 coming-of-age story is worth a watch. Kenny and Company follows a group of kids as they prank, play, and otherwise mess around during one long Halloween night. Essentially a preteen spin on Dazed and Confused or American Graffiti, this nostalgic comedy is a sweet watch for viewers of all ages.\nAlthough 2012’s Fun Size was intended to be a launching point for Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice’s movie career, the comedy proved too raunchy for kids and too anodyne for grownups. However, Fun Size is better than its brutal reviews suggest thanks to Justice’s charming central turn and a scene-stealing role for Evil Dead remake star Jane Levy. The plot, which sees Justice's heroine attempting to find her missing brother, is admittedly thin. Nonetheless, this non-horror Halloween movie offers a PG-13 spin on the Superbad/Booksmart template that is well worth a watch.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 EP Explains How Victor Timely Creates Conflict Between Loki, Sylvie, & The TVA", "date": "2023-10-04 21:35:10", "text": "Exclusive: Loki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright breaks down how Victor Timely will cause Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question everything.\nLoki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright explains how Victor Timely stands out from He Who Remains and will force Loki and his allies to question everything. Victor Timely was teased in the post-credit scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as the next variant of Kang that Loki will be dealing with. The first season ended with Sylvie killing He Who Remains after a warning about his death, leading to a new multiverse war. The MCU is setting up a major conflict with Kang at the center of it as the next Avengers-level threat in Avengers: Kang Dynasty.\nIn an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Loki season 2, Wright discussed the new Kang variant, Victor Timely. He explained why the idea of a sci-fi villain being from the past was intriguing to the team. Wright also shared how Victor Timely will force Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question their initial thoughts about him and the idea of free will. Check out Wright's full quote below:\nKevin Wright: So it started just in the concept of Victor. I think in what we were trying to do at the end of season one was to get everybody obviously terrified of, \"War is coming. This is going to be scary.\" You see the scary character in Ant-Man and just the idea that the sci-fi villain is not coming from the future, but maybe is this unassuming, slightly eccentric inventor from the past was fun. It allows us to go to exciting places.\nBut really, what was exciting about it from a character standpoint is he is kind of the perfect person to fuel the character conflict between Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA of, \"You're saying something scary is coming. You are saying that you want everybody to have free will, but you're also swearing that you're going to kill the next variant of him to pop up.\" It creates almost a contradiction or a paradox of, if you truly believe in free will, you've got to believe that man's words when he says, \"I'm my own person. I can make my own choices. I'm not the man you think I am.\" And I think it was just for somebody like Jonathan, it just fuels what he does best, which is creating really deep and complex characters.\nHe Who Remains was the first variant of Kang introduced into the MCU, and although he seemed like a clear villain, the more he explained to Loki about the TVA and multiverse, the more complicated things became. He Who Remains made it seem like the TVA was the only thing protecting their universe from the dangers, notably his variants, in the others. His warnings seemed to prove true when Sylvie killed him and the branches of the other timelines burst out from the \"sacred timeline.\"\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Breaks 2 MCU Trends That Have Defined The Last 10 Years\nThe next variant introduced was Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, who proved to be a major threat even at such low power. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania also introduced the Council of Kangs, who have their eye on the \"sacred timeline\" now that Kang is gone. Then comes Victor Timely, the main Kang variant in the new season of Loki. Although he is a Kang variant, Victor Timely is a bit of a mystery.\nInstead of a villain with impressive technological advancements, he is from the past. Victor Timely will also force Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question everything they believe. Sylvie wants everyone, notably herself, to have free will. However, this cuts both ways because it means she can't assume Victor Timely is predestined to be evil. Loki will have to grapple with He Who Remains' warning, what it means that there is another variant, and how to protect the world. While the people of the TVA will need to question everything they thought to be true.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU's Deadpool Vs Wolverine Fight Can Only End One Way", "date": "2023-10-04 21:31:31", "text": "The fight between Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in Deadpool 3 is highly anticipated, but its outcome might be predictable.\nThe fight between Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU's Deadpool 3 will be exciting, but the outcome likely won't be surprising. With Hugh Jackman's Wolverine joining Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool in the MCU, Deadpool 3 can finally display a live-action battle between the two Marvel icons in all their glory. Deadpool 3's potentially gory fight between Wolverine and Deadpool will be like nothing the MCU has ever seen before, though the aftermath might be of little importance.\nA rematch between Deadpool and Wolverine on the big screen has been brewing since 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where Wolverine had a tough time keeping up with the monstrosity that took up the Deadpool name, but ultimately came up victorious by beheading him. Years later, Fox's two Deadpool movies gave Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool a makeover, not only fixing his costume and personality but also his abilities. As it stands, Deadpool and Wolverine's MCU rematch may end very differently.\nHugh Jackman's return as Wolverine has been one of Deadpool 3's biggest reveals since the movie was first announced. Despite saying goodbye to the character in James Mangold's Logan, the idea of joining the MCU and crossing paths with Deadpool was evidently too exciting to pass up. And given both character's abilities and shared comic book history, a fight scene where both heroes go all-out against each other is all but inevitable. Deadpool 3's R rating also raises expectations, as the MCU can finally do the characters' brutal nature justice on the big screen.\nShortly after Deadpool 3's first set image featuring Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was made public, more behind-the-scenes footage provided a deeper look at Wolverine's role in the movie. As shown in set photos and videos, Wolverine and Deadpool will fight beside a wrecked Fox logo, which suggests that Deadpool, Wolverine, and possibly other non-MCU Marvel characters will get ripped out of their home universes. Whether this scene is the only fight between Deadpool and Wolverine in Deadpool 3 is yet to be seen, however.\nDeadpool and Wolverine's battle in Deadpool 3 has the potential to become the MCU's most brutal fight so far. However, there's little mystery around its outcome. Wolverine and Deadpool have incredibly fast healing factors that could extend the fight indefinitely. Wolverine has only died once in the X-Men movies, and that was only because of adamantium poisoning in a future timeline. Deadpool has been split in half and shot while wearing a mutation inhibitor, but he also recovered quite quickly. Since expecting one of them to die is futile, the only way Deadpool and Wolverine's fight can end is if they give up or if something else distracts them.\nBesides, Deadpool 3's first set photo features Wolverine and Deadpool walking side by side, which suggests that they will team up at some point in the movie. An R-rated buddy-superhero adventure is more innovative than a straightforward fight to the death, and it makes more sense for Wolverine and Deadpool to join forces to face a bigger threat together. Ultimately, Wolverine and Deadpool's MCU arrival could set up future multiversal storylines for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like Avengers: Secret Wars, so a death from either character is highly unlikely.\nDeadpool and Wolverine's similar abilities provide many opportunities for creative fight scenes. Unlike most characters, they can land brutal blows and chop each other to bits over and over before the fight ends. The main appeal of the fight lies in how they attack each other, and not how either of them dies. Wolverine and Deadpool's inability to die provides a believable reason for their friendship, and it even acknowledges Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's playful real-life feud and friendship. Both characters and actors are equals inside and outside Deadpool 3.\nAlso, letting Deadpool and Wolverine survive the events of Deadpool 3 can make them available for future MCU movies and shows. While Deadpool 3's plot may feature Deadpool killing Fox's X-Men universe and all its characters, Deadpool and Wolverine themselves are too popular to kill off in a one-off MCU story. Instead, Marvel Studios could keep them around at least until a franchise-wide crossover event, where they can interact with other MCU characters and receive a final sendoff as satisfying as Iron Man and Captain America's Avengers: Endgame farewell.\n"}

In an interview discussing his latest offering, Hickman suggested readers should expect similar from G.O.D.S.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Hickman said that the hardcover edition of G.O.D.S. will be \"House of X-size,\" with much of the writer's signature surplus content appearing for the first time in collected form.\nEven before it reaches its collected form, G.O.D.S. will be eight issues that are, according to Hickman, \"about 12 issues worth of pages.\"\nAs a comic book creator, Jonathan Hickman has become synonymous with world-building. Marvel's trust in him with one of their tentpole franchises was validated by the success of \"House of X\" and \"Powers of X,\" the foundation-shifting, timeline rearranging saga that ushered in the X-Men's Krakoan age, widely regarded as among the greatest X-Men stories to date. G.O.D.S. is Hickman, and Marvel's, attempt to replicate that success at the cosmic level of the Marvel Universe, with the series set to be characteristically dense in style – and complete in form, telling a story with a definite beginning, middle, and end.\n\"I am guilty of writing for the trade,\" Hickman told EW, \"I think about the collection from day one.\" While he went on to clarify that the plan could change as issues of the series are released individually, the \"extra content, the data pages, all that kind of stuff,\" that people have come to expect from his work, \"isn't going to show up until the hardcover.\" The reason for this: issues of G.O.D.S. are already giant-sized, packed with detail, action, and lore. Presumably, if a particularly critical piece of information needs to be delivered to the reader, a data page may find its way into an issue, but currently, readers will have to wait.\nHickman promised that the hardcover collection will \"be a completely different experience than the monthly book.\" The writer may craft his stories with the final, collected version in mind, but he emphasizes \"still maintaining the importance of the monthly book\" during the creative process. G.O.D.S. is an opportunity not just for Marvel to open up an unheralded frontier of storytelling in its fictional universe, but for Jonathan Hickman – who Marvel has also given the privileged task of reinventing its Ultimate Universe – to solidify his status as the most vital comic book creator working in the industry right now.\nSource: Entertainment Weekly\nG.O.D.S #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "11 Best Suspense Movies On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-04 21:31:31", "text": "For subscribers seeking a thrilling experience, Netflix has a number of great suspense movies across a wide range of genres in its streaming library.\nFor film fans looking for recommendations on Netflix, there are plenty of great suspense movies on the streaming service. Suspense can exist in different genres, from mystery to crime to horror, and it is more about the visceral experience of the viewing. Suspense films should evoke feelings of tension and thrills, ramping up the anxiety and anticipation as the movie's clock winds toward a dramatic climax.\nNetflix's rotating film library almost always features great options for suspense and thriller movies, including psychological horror flicks, intense espionage adventures, and twisty whodunits. The service's catalog has a number of options that are award-winning and critically acclaimed, as well as some underrated gems. For a night of suspenseful film viewing, Netflix has plenty of offerings to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\nRELATED: 10 Best Thrillers Of All Time To Watch Right Now\nNominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a number of other honors, 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterful work of high-stakes suspense in World War I. The story follows an idealistic group of young friends who enlist in the German army together. They're immediately shocked by the horrific world of death and violence they find themselves in. Like other modern war films, such as Dunkirk or 1917, All Quiet on the Western Front is filled with incredible cinematography, and it's a sensory overload sure to ramp up tension.\nBerlin Syndrome is one of the most genuinely horrifying films on Netflix, following a passionate romance gone wrong. An Australian photographer traveling in Berlin falls for a local teacher, who then traps and imprisons her in his apartment. The film is a psychological thriller that will leave its audience terrified, even though it doesn't rely on monsters or jump scares. Instead, Berlin Syndrome uses the strong performances of its stars to summon feelings of terror and dread.\nMike Flanagan has earned a reputation for his horror films, like Doctor Sleep, as well as his Netflix series, like The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass. Gerald's Game is one of Flanagan's most terrifying projects, and it is an adaptation of Stephen King's work. The film follows a married couple who travel to a remote lake house to rekindle their romance. Following a violent argument during foreplay, the man dies of a heart attack, leaving the woman handcuffed to a bed and forced to find a way to break free and survive. The premise is unique and daunting, making this an ideal suspense movie to watch.\nLéon: The Professional is a 1994 action thriller about a hitman who reluctantly bonds with a 12-year-old girl after her family is murdered. Léon tries to help the girl, Mathilda, get revenge on DEA agent Norman Stansfield by training her to kill. Gary Oldman's Agent Stansfield is an iconic and likable movie villain, setting the tone for many antagonist performances of the 21st century. The film is highly stylized with a dramatic, violent ending that will get viewers' hearts pumping.\nBird Box is an exciting horror movie and one of the best and most-watched Netflix original movies. Starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, Bird Box is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious force has killed off a large portion of the population. Survivors can't look at it, so they must be blindfolded at all times to protect themselves. This premise is claustrophobic and terrifying as is, but Bird Box also raises interesting questions about mental health and social behavior.\nMichael Mann is a master of stylized crime films full of beautiful visuals and well-written characters. Collateral brings together Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, with Cruise playing the film's villain, a silver-haired assassin named Vince. Foxx plays Max, a Los Angeles-based taxi driver who picks up Vince and is offered $600 to make five stops. When Vince realizes he's taking part in a series of hits, the conflict begins. Collateral is an incredibly engaging crime thriller that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish, utilizing strong dialogue and exciting action to tell its story.\nThe 2016 film Nocturnal Animals is a psychological thriller about a woman named Susan, who receives a violent manuscript written by her ex-husband. Seeing the similarities between the novel and their past, Susan is forced to reexamine her life. The film is incredibly dark and has some disturbing scenes, with strong performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as well as great direction from Tom Ford.\nMission: Impossible has changed in many ways over its seven-film run. While it's now known as the action franchise where Tom Cruise tries to outdo himself with insane stunts, the first film in the series is a slower-paced espionage thriller. Directed by the great Brian De Palma, 1996's Mission: Impossible is a well-written thrill ride with an old-fashioned feeling similar to classic James Bond films. The cable drop scene, in particular, is one of the most suspenseful sequences of the saga.\nThe combination of Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins guarantees a beautifully shot film, but it's the writing and performances from stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano that make Prisoners a thrilling masterpiece. The film follows Jackman as Keller Dover, the father of a six-year-old girl who's gone missing. When Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is forced to free the primary suspect due to a lack of evidence, Keller seeks justice on his own. Prisoners is as tense as mystery films get, with Jackman's performance standing out in particular.\nLike Collateral, Heat is a crime thriller from director Michael Mann. The 1995 film sees Robert De Niro as a master thief going head-to-head with Al Pacino, who plays the police lieutenant trying to catch him. It's fun seeing two all-time great actors face off, and Heat is full of excellent writing and incredibly intense action sequences. Heat is one of the best heist movies ever made, and the pacing and build-up make its longer length fly by.\nJaws is one of the most influential suspense films of all time and has been giving audiences a fear of the sea for generations. In Jaws, a giant shark terrorizes a beach town in New England, setting the stage for the film's trio of police chief, marine biologist, and ship captain, to and hunt the beast. Jaws is old enough that its effects are easier to spot, making the shark a bit less threatening. However, the atmosphere, music, and directing from Steven Spielberg still manage to make Jaws a nail-biting experience. It's worth watching on Netflix, especially for those who haven't seen it.\n"}
{"title": "Stranger Things Season 5 Will Finally Prove The Show's Real Main Character Isn't Who You Think", "date": "2023-10-04 21:20:32", "text": "Characters like Eleven and Mike have always been considered the protagonists of Stranger Things, but season 5 may shift that perspective.\nStranger Things season 5 has been confirmed as the Netflix show’s final outing, and many audiences are expecting it to shift to focus and reveal a certain character to have been the protagonist all along. In the show’s fourth season, the ensemble cast faced their greatest enemy yet — Vecna — who managed to escape at the last moment. Stranger Things season 4's ending saw the Upside Down bleeding through to the real world courtesy of this villain. It was a shocking cliffhanger that helped build the tension for the show’s fifth and final season.\nWhile Stranger Things has always been an ensemble show, it’s become even more so over the past few seasons. There are plenty of entertaining side characters that fans have come to know and love, but certain individuals have always been in the spotlight, leading most audiences to loosely call them the show’s main characters. However, one specific moment at the end of Stranger Things season 4 suggested that things aren’t quite as they seemed. It's possible Stranger Things is building toward the dark reveal that it’s been somebody else’s story all along.\nSince the beginning of Stranger Things season 1, Mike and Eleven have been the pair at the center of events. This always made sense, as Eleven was the outlier with her supernatural powers, and Mike was arguably the leader of their group of friends. Their importance in the narrative only grew stronger as Stranger Things began to explore Eleven’s backstory more thoroughly, revealing how she was connected to the Upside Down and proving that her character is necessary to defeat the demons that came from it.\nStranger Things set up Mike and Eleven’s romance very early in the show, which further helped solidify them as its main characters. While the surrounding cast might have changed, with new characters joining and old characters leaving between seasons, they’ve always remained at the cornerstone of the narrative. Other characters like Dustin, Will, and Lucas have frequently lost out on screen time in order for Stranger Things to prioritize Eleven’s story. This was necessary in order to fully explain how the Upside Down works and why characters like Vecna are so dangerous.\nAlthough she's been in the spotlight for much of Stranger Things, Eleven isn’t the only character with a tight connection to the Upside Down. Will Byers was among the first people to enter this dark dimension, and it took hold of him. He’s connected to both the Mind Flayer and Vecna, which will surely prove handy during the gang’s final battle. Eleven might have been a useful vessel for explaining the Upside Down and saving the day when nobody else could, but Will has been through so much over the past four seasons, and it might be time for Eleven to step back and let him fend for himself.\nMany fans are concerned that Will Byers might die in Stranger Things season 5, and the theory actually makes a lot of sense. He’s connected with the Upside Down in a way that seems to be impossible to undo, so destroying the dimension might require Will to sacrifice himself. This would definitively prove that Will has been the show’s protagonist all along, as everything he’s been through builds toward that climactic moment. The end of season 4 teased Will’s psychic connection with Vecna once again, proving that it’s going to be important in the future.\nAlthough it seems strange to suggest that Mike and Eleven aren't Stranger Things’ main characters, Will has arguably been at the center of the story from the very beginning. Despite being absent from Stranger Things season 1, Will was the one who set the story into motion with his disappearance. He was the one who bound the group together, even if it happened without him actively doing anything. Mike and Eleven likely wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Will's disappearance, so the claim that he's the show's protagonist isn't as outlandish at it first seems.\nStranger Things' writers also promised to give Will Byers a larger role in season 5, which suggests that something important is in store for the character. Perhaps this is when his true potential will really shine through, allowing him to overcome the hurdles that held him back in the past so that he can fully step into his protagonist role. The show has focused on developing Will Byers' character through his feelings for Mike and his mental health struggles after being trapped in the Upside Down. As such, it'd make sense if his Stranger Things storyline amounts to something big.\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's First Major Death Was Already Teased In The Boys Season 3", "date": "2023-10-04 21:18:32", "text": "Gen V does not hold itself back from featuring two horrific deaths in its first 3 episodes, one of which was even hinted at in The Boys' season 3.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nAs shocking as the first major death in Gen V may seem, it was already teased in The Boys' season 3 — here's how. Despite being a show about teenage supes, Gen V ups the ante of The Boys' shock value with unforeseeable character deaths, slambang supe showdowns, and boundary-pushing portrayals of sex. For instance, in its opening episodes, Gen V beats The Boys' gross Ant-Man parody scene by putting Little Cricket's sexual endeavors on full display.\nEven when it comes to character deaths, the spin-off series takes a no-hold-barred approach like its parent series. Its first three episodes have already featured two major character deaths, potentially setting the stage for many more. Despite being surprising, however, one of these character deaths was a long time coming, and The Boys season 3 even hinted at it in one of its episodes.\nRELATED: The Boys: Gen V Soundtrack Guide - Every Song & When It Plays\nIn The Boys' season 3's episode 5, \"The Last Time to Look on This World of Lies,\" Blue Hawk brings up Brink, recalling how he and A-Train trained under him at Godolkin University. Both A-Train and Blue Hawk call him \"Coach Brink,\" hinting at how he has been a prominent figure in The Boys' universe for a long time. Although The Boys does not reveal anything else about Brink, it sets him up as an important character in the live-action franchise's overarching storyline, hinting that he would be a key player in the narrative arcs related to Godolkin University. By setting up Brink as one of the higher authorities at Godolkin, The Boys established how his characterization and, ultimately, his death will be instrumental to Gen V's story.\nA-Train and Blue Hawk's respect for \"Coach Brink\" shows how most Godolkin University graduates love him. Gen V affirms this in its opening episode by highlighting how he looks out for the top supes of the academy by covering up for their crimes from behind the scenes and even ensures that supes like Jordan Li do not feel ostracized at the academy. When A-Train and Blue Hawk were at Godolkin's University, Brink must have pulled some strings for them as well to ensure they did well as supes once they graduated.\nHowever, at the same time, A-Train and Blue Hawk's \"Coach Brink\" reference from The Boys also highlights how Brink is not the kind of man anyone would want to mess with. Even though he does not have supe powers, he holds enough power and influence to be revered by powerful supes like A-Train and Blue Hawk. This again comes into play in Gen V, where Brink earns the trust of many young supes like Jordan Li but crosses all moral boundaries to exploit supes and their abilities by expelling unprivileged students like Marie and being involved in the malicious experiments at the Woods.\n"}

The long-running comedy sketch show, which features a regular cast of comic actors along with weekly rotating guest hosts, is preparing to run season 49 with a cast that includes Punkie Johnson, Chloe Fineman, Kenan Thompson, Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, and Bowen Yang. Season 48 ended early when the Writers Guild of America went on strike, but now that the strike has ended it can return despite the ongoing Screen Actors Guild strike. This is because the cast's contracts are not among those currently under dispute as the union fights for fair pay.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, an official release date has been set for Saturday Night Live season 49. The show is officially set to return on October 14 with SNL alum Pete Davidson returning as host alongside musical guest Ice Spice. The following week, the episode will be hosted by Bad Bunny, who will do double duty as the musical guest.\nPete Davidson’s return to Saturday Night Live has come rather soon after his original departure. He exited the show in 2022 after eight years as part of the cast. However, he hasn't rested on his laurels since he exited the show alongside other veteran performers including Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon, and Kyle Mooney.\nIncluded among his many post-SNL roles are a variety of cameos capitalizing on his notoriety, both from his stint on SNL and his string of tabloid-fodder romantic relationships. These cameos included surprise appearances in the big-budget movies Fast X and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as well as the Netflix Christmas special Who Killed Santa? A Murderville Murder Mystery. However, 2022 also saw him hold major roles in Bodies Bodies Bodies, Meet Cute, and Good Mourning.\nAs if his 2022 wasn't busy enough between those titles and Saturday Night Live, Davidson has held a variety of roles this year before his return to the stage on the iconic late-night show. Since the year began, he has appeared on episodes of The Freak Brothers and American Dad as well as playing Dumb Money's Kevin Gill and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' Mirage. He also played a fictionalized version of himself on the Peacock dramedy show Bupkis, more than earning this victory lap on Saturday Night Live.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "Will Baylan Skoll Be Recast In Ahsoka Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "The tragic passing of Ray Stevenson means Lucasfilm is faced with an impossible choice; what do they do with Baylan Skoll after Ahsoka?\nThis article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nRay Stevenson's Baylan Skoll was one of the highlights of Ahsoka, but now Lucasfilm is faced with a difficult choice about whether to recast the character. Already no stranger to Star Wars, Ray Stevenson was delighted to be joining Star Wars in live-action. His presence was one of the highlights of Star Wars Celebration 2023, with Stevenson radiating sheer joy as he anticipated the reception of his character, Baylan Skoll.\nRay Stevenson sadly passed away on May 21, 2023, leaving the cast and crew of Ahsoka shaken. Ahsoka's premiere released with a touching tribute - \"For Our Friend, Ray\" - and in interviews his fellow stars have continually stressed their love for him. He was clearly a joy to work with, and is sadly missed. But, unfortunately, the ending of Ahsoka leaves Lucasfilm in a very difficult position - because Baylan Skoll is set up for an important future role.\nThere can be no doubt Ray Stevenson's dark Jedi Baylan Skoll was one of the highlights of Ahsoka. Baylan was a fascinating and complex character, and his motives are still a mystery; he seems to have had great hopes for his Padawan, Shin Hati, only to give them up when he heard a siren song from the ancient world of Peridea. Stevenson gave Baylan a certain intensity and resolve, and the dynamic he shared with Ivanno Sakhno (who played his violent Padawan Shin Hati) was tremendous. But he'll best be remembered for the stunning fight scenes he shared with Rosario Dawson's Ahsoka Tano; Baylan proved to be the one foe Ahsoka couldn't defeat, and he almost killed her.\nRelated: Ahsoka Ending Explained In Full\nThe problem, though, is that Ahsoka has left Baylan's story unfinished. His backstory is a mystery; how does he know so much about Anakin Skywalker, given his transformation into Darth Vader was a closely guarded secret? His motives remain inscrutable, clearly tied to the Mortis gods by Ahsoka's finale, but that in itself sets him up for an even greater role. He was seen stood next to the statue of the Father, a cosmic being who sought to strike a cosmic harmonious balance between light and dark, a hint at his true agenda. All this means there's absolutely no way Lucasfilm can continue this story without Baylan Skoll.\nIt's nothing short of a tragedy that Ray Stevenson passed before he got to see how much Baylan Skoll was loved by viewers. What's more, it's to Lucasfilm's credit that his story was not adjusted in any way, because there's no hint the overarching narrative was changed after Stevenson's passing. This means viewers - as well as the cast and crew - got to say farewell to a tremendous actor, to see his last performance in full.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nBut this also means that Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni has left everything up in the air for Baylan. His story ends on an ambiguous note, with the dark Jedi continuing to explore Peridea, heading toward what seems to be a powerful Force vergence that called to him across the galaxies. What's more, given three other major characters are stranded on Peridea as well, this feels as though it is being set up in a concrete direction. There's no writing Baylan out, and no additional footage that can be refashioned as a homage. The only way to continue to honor Ray Stevenson is now to recast the character, allowing audiences to see Baylan Skoll's future.\nThis is all the more important because Ahsoka's ending kept Baylan as something of a mystery box. Such a mystery only works if the payoff is worth it, meaning Baylan's role in Ahsoka would be retrospectively damaged if Star Wars chose to somehow drop the character, perhaps killing him off-screen. The sense of anticlimax would echo back to the earlier stories, because they are left feeling incomplete and unsatisfying. To preserve Baylan's story in Ahsoka season 1, it is necessary to continue it.\nThis will, of course, be a very difficult and painful process. Ray Stevenson wasn't just a colleague; it's abundantly clear he was a good friend to many in Lucasfilm, and they mourn his passing. There's a sense of intense pressure to get this right. Meanwhile, the Star Wars fanbase - always noted for its divisiveness - will be watching carefully. Baylan Skoll needs to be recast for Ahsoka season 2 (or whatever comes next) - but it won't be easy.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are streaming now on Disney+.\nTom Bacon is Head of Screen Rant's Star Wars coverage. Although he's now dedicated to Star Wars content, he's a lifelong fan of several other major franchises including Doctor Who and Marvel. You can find him on Twitter @TomABacon.

{"title": "10 Best Movies Like The Creator", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "Gareth Edwards’ The Creator features impressive visuals as it explores the nuances of AI, and there are several other good movies just like it.\nGareth Edwards' latest film, The Creator, has been positively received, and there are plenty of movies just like it for those wishing for more. The science-fiction film takes place in a futuristic world where Western civilization has declared war on AI. The efforts to eradicate AI are combated by the fictional nation of New Asia. An ex-special forces agent is tasked with traveling to New Asia and destroying a new AI weapon. The Creator explores ideas about humanity's relationship with AI, debuting at a time when its core theme couldn't be more relevant.\nThe Creator uses science-fiction as a medium to tell a story about empathy and what it means to be sentient and human. This is a story that's been explored in Hollywood before. While the movie's premise received a mixed response from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Edwards' visual style was met with near unanimous praise. A similar approach can be seen in Edwards' best movies, as well as in the projects that inspired his work.\nOne of the best science-fiction movies of all time, Blade Runner is the most obvious next stop for fans of The Creator. Ridley Scott's 1982 film is massively influential on the science fiction genre, having popularized a cyberpunk aesthetic that's used in video games, anime, and other mediums. Speaking to Far Out Magazine, Edwards cited Blade Runner as one of his primary inspirations for creating a visually stunning backdrop. Like The Creator, Blade Runner is set in Los Angeles in a world ravaged by nuclear warfare. It also features a hero tasked with hunting AI, who develops more complicated feelings on the matter as the film goes on.\nFor Edwards' signature sci-if visuals, there's no better option than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. While Godzilla and Monsters have great shots, Rogue One sees Edwards working with his highest budget, bringing to life bright and beautiful worlds. The film tells the story of the rebel team that steals the Death Star plans just before A New Hope. Edwards has mentioned his great affection for Star Wars, and he's cited the design of the original trilogy as one of his chief inspirations for The Creator.\nDirected by Alex Garland and produced by A24, Ex Machina is one of the most popular sci-fi films of the 2010s. The film follows a programmer named Caleb, who is brought to the private estate of his company's CEO, where he's shown a humanoid robot named Ava. Caleb is prompted to interact with Ava and judge whether she's capable of consciousness. While it doesn't have the heavy action of The Creator, Ex Machina features similar themes and ideas. Ex Machina explores the complicated relationship between human beings and AI, as well as the potential consequences of further developing AI.\nAlfonso Cuarón's Children of Men is one of the most iconic sci-fi films of the 21st century. Set in a grim world that's been ruined by environmental issues and war, infertility has become an existential threat. Like with The Creator, Children of Men follows a man traveling with and protecting someone he believes could be the key to saving humanity. In this case, it is the only known pregnant woman on Earth.\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is one of James Cameron's most influential science-fiction films ever, and its among the best for fans of The Creator. Terminator 2 subverts expectations by making T-800 a protagonist, exploring the ideas of the positive use of AI. While humans are at war with AI in The Creator, the film explores the complexity of the issue, a discussion that's highly prevalent through the ending of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In addition to sharing similar themes with The Creator, the first two Terminator movies are just incredible sci-fi action features that are must-watch materials for those who enjoy the genre.\nDirected by Stanley Kubrick, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the most important science-fiction movies ever made. While its pacing is slower than what modern film fans might be used to, it's an essential film that everyone should watch at least once. The influence of 2001 is everywhere in science-fiction and pop culture, from the space scenes in early Star Wars to the opening scene in Barbie. Most notably for fans of The Creator, 2001's HAL-9000 character is one of the earliest and most prominent explorations of AI in cinema.\nAkira is one of the most well-known anime movies in the West, Edwards drew inspiration from the animated classic for The Creator. While Akira doesn't explore AI, it shares similar stylistic choices and ideas, such as a newly formed Eastern nation following a devastating blast, satellite weapons firing blue beams down on Earth, and super-powered children. Akira is set in a futuristic world where science is seeing great progress, but that progress is primarily helping bureaucratic and wealthy bodies.\nSoylent Green is an underrated gem of sci-fi movies, released in 1973 and starring Charlton Heston. The film follows an NYPD detective in a dystopian, futuristic world where the natural resources have run dry. People are reliant on mass-produced, factory-made wafers of different colors and unknown ingredients for their food, with the latest being \"Soylent Green.\" The film explores a ravaged society and ideas of government conspiracy, much like The Creator, which critiques the U.S. government.\nA Perfect World is not a sci-fi movie, but it was mentioned by Edwards, along with Rain Man, as a narrative inspiration for The Creator. The 1993 film, which stars Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood, sees Costner playing an escaped prisoner who kidnaps a young boy. The prisoner and his captive travel across the U.S., forming an unexpected bond. For viewers of The Creator who were interested in the relationship between Joshua and Alphie, A Perfect World will make a solid follow-up.\nLike A Perfect World, The Road is a film with a similar relationship to the one between Joshua and Alphie in The Creator. The Road follows a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world, surviving and scavenging on their journey toward the sea. The world of The Road is much more grim than society in The Creator, but it's one of the best examples of stories that show the importance of family and companionship in dark times.\nSource: Far Out Magazine\n"}

With the secret knowledge of Yggdrasil now revealed, it begins to paint a picture of why stories and storytelling are among the most important forces in the Asgardian mythology and reframes several crucial tales from years past.\nImmortal Thor #2 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by Martin Cóccolo, colored by Matthew Wilson and lettered by VC’s Joe Sabino) reveals exactly what wisdom Odin learned millennia ago, aka the Odin-Knowledge. In flashback, readers see Odin cut out his eye before Yggdrasil. After, as his pulled into the tree by its roots, he is told by the World Tree: \"Yes. This is the lesson. This is the parable. The story always changes. The meaning always remains. There is always a sacrifice. Always a cost Bor-Son. For the Winter to end. For Spring to come again.\"\nIt seems this wisdom is, at least partially, the knowledge that all stories have common elements. The exact story might change, but their shape remains the same.\nRelated: \"I Have to Try\": Immortal Thor's Writer Promises His Best Work Yet\nIn both Norse mythology and in Marvel’s own version, Odin takes out his own eye at the foot of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. In most retellings he also hangs himself on the tree’s branches. This sacrifice gives him some form of wisdom, secret knowledge and/or understanding of the deepest Asgardian mysteries. In Thor vol. 6 #20-23 (written by Donny Cates, penciled and inked by Nic Klein, colored by Matt Wilson and lettered by Joe Sabino), Odin dies, passing on the full power of the Odin-Force to Thor. Now, sidled with the wisdom of his father, Thor must find a way to balance ruling Asgard with his other responsibilities.\nThe Odin-Knowledge ties directly into the importance of stories for the Asgardians. In Loki: Agent of Asgard #13 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by Lee Garbett, colored by Antinio Fabela and lettered by Clayton Cowles) Loki is remade as not the God of Lies, but the God of Stories. Al Ewing himself has been one of the primary architects of this evolution for Loki, exploring their development throughout Loki: Agent of Asgard, Defenders: Beyond and now Immortal Thor as well. This reveal of the Odin-Knowledge only ties Loki’s status quo more directly into the very fabric of the Asgardian gods.\nThis also adds depth to a crucial Thor story. In Thor: Disassembled (Thor vol. 2 #80-85, written by by Michael Avon Oeming and David Berman, penciled and inked by Andrea DiVito, colored by Laura Villari and lettered by Randy Gentile) Thor repeats Odin’s sacrifice, taking out both his eyes and hanging himself on Yggdrasil to gain that same wisdom. It’s this that leads him to discover that the cycle of Ragnarök is an endless blood-tithe to the parasitic Those Who Sit Above in Shadow. If the Odin-Knowledge is about the cyclical nature of conflicts, it's no wonder that Thor is able to discern that he is trapped in exactly such a tale.\nImmortal Thor #2 is available now from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "10 Anime Detectives Better Than Conan", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "While they may not have solved nearly as many cases as the legendary Conan, these detectives can uncover the truth behind any mystery.\nWhile they may not be the leading characters of the most popular genre, anime detectives are often some of the smartest and most memorable characters, particularly known for their extraordinary feats of intelligence and unexpected solutions to anime's biggest mysteries. No matter how impossible their challenge may be, these investigators seem to always know how to gather all the necessary information and find the right answers.\nGreat detectives are always admired across all media, with notable examples being the timeless Sherlock Holmes, and anime is no different, particularly thanks to the popularity of Case Closed's Conan. Proving themselves to possess deduction and analytical skills far superior to their peers, these characters are shown to be some of the most brilliant detectives the medium has to offer, solving even the toughest cases with ease.\nB: The Beginning's protagonist Keith Kazama Flick is a legendary investigator affiliated with the Royal Police Service, who aims to uncover the identity of the notorious Killer B. Though he retired from being an investigator when his sister was murdered, suffering profound trauma as a result, he ended up taking the case at the behest of an old friend. His appearance and behavior often cause people to assume he is lazy, but the truth is that he is a genius when it comes to math and calculations, using his knowledge to accurately predict his target's next moves, and then acting accordingly to ensure he has the upper hand.\nThe events of Id:Invaded take place in a world where something known as the Mizuhanome System exists, allowing people to explore human minds by entering abstract psychological planes that depict their unconscious thoughts. However, only those who have killed others are able to enter these id wells. Akihito Narihisago is one such detective-turned-criminal, who ended up in police custody after taking revenge on his daughter's murderer. Still possessing a profound hatred towards serial killers, as well as his remarkable skills and experience as a detective, he now solves murder cases by using the Mizuhanome System and investigating id wells, getting to know criminals better than they know themselves.\nWhile not a detective per se, given that Houtarou Oreki is still in school, he could easily become one of the best, should he make up his mind to expend the necessary energy. Hyouka follows Houtarou as he uses his exceptional deduction skills to solve mysteries, prompted by the ever-curious Eru Chitanda, whom he has feelings for. He is generally passive and apathetic, living by the idea that he should only do what is necessary, but whenever Eru comes up to him with something she wants to find out the truth behind, he proves that he is significantly smarter than his grades would have one believe, displaying unexpected skills.\nBeautiful Bones -Sakurako's Investigation-'s titular protagonist is Sakurako Kujou, a trained osteologist with a genuine passion for bones and skeletons. Moreover, she was also mentored by a renowned forensic scientist, further increasing her repertoire of skills. Using her rich knowledge and expertise, she often acts as a forensic consultant for the local prefectural police, assisting them in solving murder cases that would otherwise seem impossible. While the scope of the cases she solves may not be particularly large, Sakurako would certainly be able to figure out any mystery involving bones, as no bone can keep any secrets from her and her investigative skills.\nInitially affiliated with the Public Safety Bureau, working for the Criminal Investigation Department's Division 01, Shinya Kougami is a brilliant detective who would go to any lengths to uncover the truth behind any mystery, no matter what there is to lose in the process. At first, he is an Inspector, but after one of his colleagues becomes victim to the murderer they were investigating together, Shinya's feelings intensify and his crime coefficient goes up, after which he is demoted to being an Enforcer. Psycho-Pass' first protagonist combines his knowledge, experience, and instincts with an unparalleled fearlessness, to deal with cases in a way no one else possibly could.\nRelated: PSYCHO-PASS Gives Fans A Full Recap Video Ahead Of New Movie (Exclusive First Look)\nWhile Gosick's protagonist, Victorique de Blois, was already born with seemingly superhuman intelligence, her knowledge was further honed during her childhood, as she was forced to live in the dungeon of the de Blois Mansion, constantly reading books that most adults couldn't even begin to comprehend. She was later sent to Saint Marguerite Academy, where was supposed to remain mostly isolated from her peers. Victorique may just be one of the smartest anime characters ever, shown to not only read and absorb knowledge at tremendous speeds, but also possess unparalleled skills in terms of observation, analysis, investigation, and logic, nearly being able to predict the future perfectly.\nWhile The Millionaire Detective – Balance: UNLIMITED follows a pair of detectives, Daisuke Kanbe is certainly the more interesting of the two. As the titular millionaire detective, Daisuke seems to hold the belief that everything can and should be solved through money, which, as the scion of a billionaire family, he possesses in abundance. Typically solving mysteries in a somewhat aggressive manner, in ways that involve bribery, cutting-edge technology, and showy connections, he always gets to the bottom of a case, no matter how much money it takes. While his methods may be unconventional and occasionally morally ambiguous, their effectiveness is undeniable, proving that his belief about money is correct.\nSet in a dystopian future, Un-Go follows Shinjuurou Yuuki and his associate Inga, as they solve various cases together. While Inga also plays a role in pinning down the truth, thanks to their ability to force a subject to truthfully answer a single question, it is Shinjuurou who can investigate the details and find the perfect question to ask. Some people refer to him as \"The Defeated Detective\", because he was once proven to incorrectly assess a situation, but he seems to have resolved himself not to repeat that mistake since, as he continues to use his extraordinary intelligence and analytical skills to solve case after case.\nPsychic Detective Yakumo's titular protagonist Yakumo Saitou is a seemingly normal college student who has the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Somehow getting dragged into various cases, he always manages to solve the case before anyone else does, including the police, and not just because of his special ability. He is shown to be not only extremely intelligent, observant, and logical, but also absolutely willing to resort to tricks and traps if they allow him to get what he wants. While being able to see ghosts does occasionally help, it has in fact caused him more hardships than fortune in life, which is why he typically hides his crimson-red eye with colored contacts.\nDeath Note's L is perhaps the medium's most famous detective, known for his attempt to discover the identity of the mass murderer known as Kira. Found and taken to an orphanage for gifted children by Watari, who would later become his assistant, L displayed incredible intelligence early on, becoming a reputable detective at a young age. Though his disheveled appearance may cause people to doubt his credibility, he is known as the world's greatest detective for a reason. His analytical and deductive skills are second to none, and he's not afraid to lure suspects into a false sense of security to ensure his success, whether that requires deception or subterfuge.\nEven though not all of these characters may be proper detectives, with some working as independent consultants and others merely solving mysteries on a whim, prompted by circumstances, they all prove to have the necessary intelligence and deduction skills to excel in the field. Perhaps, if they put their mind to it, they could even solve some of anime's biggest mysteries. Whether they aim to identify the culprits behind cruel homicidal cases, or simply seek to explore local mysteries, all of these characters are worthy of being known as the best anime detectives ever.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section. He discovered his passion for the medium as a child, watching shows like Death Note on late-night TV, and has been enthralled with it ever since. In order to deepen his understanding of the industry, he obtained a degree in Communication & Media from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, where he also found his passion for writing and analyzing pieces of media. "}
{"title": "What's Going On With Jonathan Majors?", "date": "2023-10-04 20:51:28", "text": "After his MCU debut as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors was arrested for assault. Here's what's going on now.\nAfter his debut in season 1 of Loki as the Kang variant He Who Remains and as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors was charged with domestic violence and assault, raising big questions for the future of the MCU. After the defeat of Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU turned to its next big bad, hiring Jonathan Majors to play the time-traveling, multiversal villain Kang the Conqueror (and all his variants). However, serious charges leveled at the actor now put Disney and Marvel Studios in a tight spot.\n2023 was off to a big start for Jonathan Majors. Creed III debuted to rave reviews and a strong box office performance, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marked his first theatrical outing as Kang the Conqueror, but in March, Jonathan Majors was arrested for misdemeanor charges of assault, strangulation, and harassment after an altercation with his girlfriend. Majors' attorney insists the actor is innocent of the charges, claiming video evidence and witness testimony will exonerate him, putting a big wrinkle in the future development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe until there's a clear resolution to his case.\nAfter the MCU's Infinity Saga featured Josh Brolin's Thanos, culminating in his defeat in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU was without an overarching antagonist until the introduction of Kang the Conqueror. Kang is a time-traveling supervillain from the future who leverages his superior intellect, advanced technology, and numerous variants to wage war on the multiverse. As teased in the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, there are numerous iterations of Kang, with dozens of versions played by Jonathan Majors already depicted on-screen, making him far more difficult to recast than Thanos, who was portrayed by a different actor in his initial tease at the end of The Avengers.\nMajors' first appearance was in the season 1 finale of Loki, followed by a bigger role in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but he had multiple additional appearances slated in the coming years. A post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania already teased his expanded part in Loki season 2, which is set to release in October, but the next Avengers movie, scheduled for May 2026, has the character's name in the title: Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. It's unclear how Disney and Marvel Studios will react to the charges against Majors, but his big role in the MCU's future makes the issue impossible to ignore for too long.\nMajors was initially arrested in New York on March 25, 2023, under charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment. The NYPD says the arrest was in response to a 911 call from the victim in which she \"informed the police she was assaulted.\" The statement from the NYPD also said the victim \"sustained minor injuries to her head and neck and was removed to an area hospital in stable condition.\" On April 19, a report revealed multiple additional alleged victims of Jonathan Majors were working with the Manhattan district attorney’s office on additional abuse allegations.\nAfter the charges, Majors was removed from ad campaigns for the United States Army and the Texas Rangers, and his role in Nadia Latif's movie The Man in My Basement, in addition to Majors being dropped by his management company and PR representation. Majors is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but the fact that he's being dropped by his representation indicates a lack of confidence in his defense. Even if Majors is innocent, the allegations have already had serious consequences on his career. If he's convicted of the charges, it will only get worse, including criminal penalties potentially including up to one year in prison.\nMajors' lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, claims he's innocent of all charges and is \"provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows.\" She says witness testimony and video evidence will fully exonerate Majors. Additionally, Chaudhry claims the charges are an example of racial discrimination by the New York justice system: “This glaring double standard between the treatment of Jonathan Majors, a Black man weighing 200 lbs, and his accuser, highlights the racial bias that permeates the criminal justice system.”\nAfter Majors' initial arrest, Chaudhry released text messages to TMZ featuring the alleged victim apologizing to Majors for putting him in this position and saying she would \"make sure nothing happens about this.\" The text messages from the victim also show her taking blame for the incident and that she told police \"it was my fault for trying to grab your phone.\" Despite the texts deflecting blame from Majors, they still implicitly acknowledge some sort of violent altercation occurred, which, paired with the victim's documented injuries, will be difficult for Majors to dismiss in court.\nDuring the Sept. 15 hearing, Judge Michael Gaffey set Wednesday, Oct. 25 for the next hearing, per Variety. In September, Majors' attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case and the Manhattan District Attorney's office must respond by Oct. 6; then the defense must respond by Oct. 13.\nOn Sept. 6, a short hearing was held where it was decided that another would be held on Sept. 15, as reported by Deadline. The cause for the latest delay comes from the defense, who stated there were “deficiencies” in discovery on their end. Majors did not appear in person for the Sept. 6 hearing, but did appear virtually.\nPreviously on Aug. 3, 2023, Majors appeared in person in a lower Manhattan courtroom for what was meant to be the start of his trial. However, according to Deadline, Judge Gaffey approved a postponement following Assistant D.A Kelli Galaway's request for more time for discovery. Following the hearing, DA spokesperson Doug Cohen told Deadline, \"We look forward to presenting the full facts and evidence at trial.\" Chaudhry issued a statement after the court hearing:\nFor an excruciating four months, Jonathan Majors, the real victim in this shameful ordeal, has had his life, career, and reputation torn apart. Yet he remains unwavering in his determination to be absolved from this harrowing ordeal.\nPreviously on June 20, 2023, Majors appeared in court for the first time since his March arrest. Shortly after, Chaudhry issued a statement that noted how Majors' legal team had urged the judge to instantly dismiss the charges brought against the actor and initiate proceedings against Grace Jabbari, Majors' first alleged victim, who Majors' legal team now claims attacked him first. Per Deadline, the NYPD has \"no plans\" to make an arrest.\nMajors is just the most recent superhero star to encounter legal trouble and negative press after Ezra Miller, Amber Heard, Anthony Starr, and other comic book actors have faced similar criticisms in recent years. While none of those actors lost their roles due to the allegations against them (with Starr being the only one actually convicted of assault), Marvel previously fired James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 over offensive tweets he'd made in the past. Gunn obviously eventually returned to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, but they may not be so quick to pull the trigger with Jonathan Majors.\nThe allegations against Majors are concerning and should be taken seriously, but Disney and Marvel Studios will likely wait to make any serious decisions about the actor's future until the case has been resolved in a court of law. While the accusations are sure to tarnish his career even if he's ultimately found innocent, Majors wouldn't be the first MCU star in legal trouble. The MCU kicked off by taking a big swing on Iron Man by casting a then-disgraced Robert Downey Jr., and Thanos actor Josh Brolin was also arrested for domestic battery in 2004, although Majors' charges are far more serious.\nWhile Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is still a few years away, Loki season 2 is a far more immediate concern for Marvel Studios. Majors' role as the Kang variant Victor Timely was already teased in Quantumania, but the actor could also portray multiple other variants in the series. Originally expected to release on Disney+ in the summer, Loki season 2 will now premiere on October 6. The reason for the delay is unclear, though it may be an attempt to avoid overlap with Majors' legal proceedings. Marvel Studios has not yet commented on the reason for Loki season 2's delay to October 6, 2023.\nIn the lead up to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's Disney+ release on May 17, Jonathan Majors' Kang was featured only very briefly in the two trailers Marvel Studios posted online. The focus of the trailers was put more on Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne and Katherine Newton's Cassie Lang, which makes sense given they're the lead heroes. However, Majors' Kang was a focal point of the promotion for the initial theatrical release of the movie, so his lack of presence in the streaming release promotional material is notable.\nFurther, at Disney's upfront presentation on May 16, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige spoke to assembled advertisers and press about upcoming MCU shows, including Loki. He announced Loki season 2's October release date, spoke about the series, and screened a trailer. According to Axios reporter Tim Baysinger (via Twitter), Feige didn't mention Majors, nor did Victor Timely or any other Kang variants appear in the Loki season 2 trailer. As previously stated, it's expected Majors will have a sizable role in Loki season 2 following Quantumania's post-credits scene, but Marvel Studios may be choosing to downplay his involvement in the marketing of the show.\nNeither Disney, Marvel Studios, nor Kevin Feige have commented on Majors' assault arrest as of the publication of this article. Previously, a Deadline report published on April 17, 2023, stated Marvel had not discussed recasting Majors in the MCU at that time. With the MCU's Phase 5 continuing after the June premiere of Secret Invasion on Disney+, however, Marvel won't be able to stay quiet on Majors for much longer.\nAccording to Joanna Robinson, author of the book MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios, Marvel changed their plans for MCU Phase 5 and 6 after seeing Jonathan Majors' performance as He Who Remains in Loki season 1 and Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Further, Robinson said she's heard different stories about what the studio plans to do in regard to Majors' role in the MCU following his arrest. Robinson said:\nI was told by someone who works for Marvel, it was not the plan to make Kang the center of everything until they saw the dailies from Quantumania and after his performance in Loki, which was so strong they were like, 'This is it. This is our way forward'... They don’t usually hang this much on one person in the way that they did here. And that has put them in the bind. We do not know what they are going to do. I've heard conflicting stories about they are going to replace him, they’re not even considering replacing him etc. etc. But it’s just one more thing.\nSince Robinson didn't go into further detail, it's unclear what Marvel Studios' original plan for the Multiverse Saga, which concludes with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, may have been. It's been speculated Doctor Doom could've been a major threat for Secret Wars, since Phase 6's Fantastic Four movie releases prior to The Kang Dynasty. It's also uncertain what Marvel Studios may do in light of the charges against Majors. Until Marvel Studios releases an official statement, it can be presumed the studio is moving forward with Kang the Conqueror as a major villain in the MCU Phase 5 and 6.\nDuring an interview with Inverse, published on June 28, 2023, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier star Anthony Mackie was questioned about the future of Kang the Conqueror in the MCU after Majors' arrest. Mackie responded to questioning by stating:\nWe're a country that was built on 'everyone is innocent until proven guilty,' that's one of the staples of this country. Nothing has been proven about this dude. Nothing. So everyone is innocent until proven guilty.\nMackie became the first individual within Marvel Studios to make any comment on the arrest and allegations, though he refrained from speculating whether Jonathan Majors would be recast in the MCU's future.\nIn the lead up to the premiere of Loki season 2, producer Kevin Wright was asked by Variety about whether Majors' assault arrest affected the show. Wright explained that it didn't, largely because all filming on the season wrapped in 2022, prior to Majors' arrest. When asked if the arrest led to any discussions of making changes to Loki season 2, Wright said:\nNo. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\nBased on Wright's comment, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the result of Majors' trial before making any decisions about how to proceed with his involvement in the MCU. However, it's clear that no changes were made to Loki season 2 due to the arrest of Jonathan Majors.\n"}
{"title": "All Child's Play Movies, Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-04 20:40:28", "text": "Chucky is a longstanding icon of the horror genre with eight movie installments in his celebrated Child's Play franchise. Here's every film, ranked.\nThe evil doll Chucky's best movies of the longstanding Child's Play franchise are ranked here from worst to best. The original Child's Play movie started out as a script called Batteries Not Included by writer Don Mancini which was later retitled Blood Buddy. The initial concept was that a boy named Andy was given a doll that was filled with fake blood but would later come alive when Andy accidentally mixed his own blood with it. The doll, who would become known as the infamous Chucky, would come to life when Andy went to sleep, acting out his unconscious desire to kill. The story had intended to be a mystery with viewers unsure if it was Chucky or Andy carrying out the murders.\nWhen Tom Holland (Fright Night) came on board to direct Child's Play the concept was completely changed. A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray transfers his soul into a Chucky doll just before his human body dies. With his soul trapped in a toy, he needs to transfer his evil spirit to a human body or be trapped in the doll for good so he selects Andy as a host. The movie was a smash hit and Chucky would return many times in the years that followed although the tone and genre of each sequel would vary wildly. With a 2019 remake and a 2021 TV series presenting fans with a fresh take on Chucky, let's take a look through the franchise and rank each entry from worst to best.\nRELATED: Chucky: 10 Movies & TV Shows Where You've Seen The Cast\nThe only entry in the franchise that's a true disappointment is 1991's Child Play 3. This sequel was released a mere nine months after the second movie. This rush to shoot a new sequel ultimately hurt the final product. The premise finds Chucky coming back to life 8 years after part two and tracking his old nemesis Andy to a military school. While the setting is unique and Brad Dourif (The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) is typically excellent as Chucky's voice, the third movie lacks in suspense and new ideas. Outside the occasional inspired touch like a showdown in a funhouse, Child's Play 3 is a relative dud.\nSeed Of Chucky was series creator Don Mancini's directorial debut. He decided to completely embrace a cartoony tone instead of making a straightforward slasher. Seed of Chucky picks up after the ending of Bride Of Chucky, which features Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) giving birth to a baby doll. The movie has been accurately described as an over-the-top farce with numerous creative stretches such as Tilly playing both herself and Tiffany and cameos from John Waters (Feud) and Redman. While it's silly and fun in its own right Seed of Chucky hardly feels like a horror movie at all, which is why it's one of the least loved entries.\nRELATED: Child's Play: How to Watch Every Chucky Movie in Order\nDon Mancini returned for 2017's Cult Of Chucky which finds the survivor of the previous film Nica (Fiona Dourif) in a psychiatric rehabilitation center. Cult of Chucky is arguably the most experimental installment of the series and features bizarre visuals and creative deaths likely inspired by Mancini's work on the Hannibal series. The movie also features surprise cameos by previous cast members and ends on an intriguing note that sets up a further story. While Cult of Chucky is a solid and suspenseful entry, it feels a little underwhelming after the home run that was Curse Of Chucky.\nChucky and the Child's Play franchise arrived at an interesting time in the world of slasher films. Major series like Halloween and Friday The 13th were starting to wind down after disappointing sequels. Child's Play 2 picks up two years after the original with Andy taken in by a foster family. The toy company behind the Chucky doll decides to rebuild the destroyed doll which comes to life and seeks out Andy. Child's Play 2 embraces a more comic tone and features a number of fun set pieces. One scene features Chucky a Terminator-style showdown in a toy factory. The sequel doesn't go too far outside the standard but it's a lean, energetic follow-up regardless.\nRELATED: 10 Most Consistent Horror Franchises To Binge, According To Reddit\nThe Child's Play remake has proven somewhat controversial, with creator Don Mancini distancing himself from it while he focuses on the Child's Play TV show Chucky. The movie also marks the first time Brad Dourif hadn't voiced Chucky but with a great replacement in Mark Hamill. Despite this outside drama, the remake is a surprisingly fun reinvention of the Child's Play franchise. It takes the basic concept of a lonely boy being given the Chucky doll only to discover he has advanced A.I. built in which gives him control over gadgets.\nAfter forming a bond with the new Andy, the defective doll takes offense to anyone hurting Andy and starts offing victims in gory yet darkly comedic ways. The cast is also a highlight, especially Gabriel Bateman (Light's Out) as the new Andy. The humor in the remake can be too broad at times and Chucky's backstory is rather thin but the Child's Play 2019 reboot is much better than expected.\nAfter a decade of slashers with a repetitive but unique gimmick like A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Child's Play introduced the murderous doll Chucky to the world. The original movie is quite tame for much of its runtime, playing out more like a suspenseful thriller than a bloody horror flick. The central relationship between Andy and his mother is sweet and director Tom Holland milks a good amount of tension from the stalking sequences. The movie might be a touch slow for modern tastes but Child's Play is still a great and efficient thriller.\nRELATED: Does Jade Kill Chucky In Bride Of Chucky?\nFollowing the lukewarm response to Child's Play 3, the series appeared effectively done. Horror movies, in general, entered a weird time in the 1990s. It wasn't until Scream revitalized the genre that studios regained interest. This led to Bride Of Chucky, where Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend Tiffany brings him back to life once more and they go on a romantic killing spree. Bride has all the gore and creative kills fans could ask for but the comedic interplay between Dourif and Tilly and Ronny Yu's (Freddy Vs Jason) energetic direction is what makes it click. The movie also introduced Chucky's iconic scarred look and is arguably the most popular entry outside the 1988 original.\nFollowing the box-office disappointment of Seed Of Chucky, Mancini considered remaking the original and revisiting his Blood Buddy idea. When untangling the rights proved too difficult, he instead opted for Curse Of Chucky, a tonal reboot that was also the first to go straight to DVD. While this has spelled the death of other horror franchises like Hellraiser, it surprisingly resulted in the best entry in the Child's Play series to date. Everything about Curse Of Chucky works superbly.\nThe best features include Fiona Dourif's strong new heroine Nica, the overall gothic tone, the intriguing family drama, the impressive set pieces, and the surprising links to past entries. Curse of Chucky is a love letter to the franchise and to its dedicated fans, proving that Chucky actually could be a hit again. These qualities solidify Curse of Chucky as the greatest movie in the Child's Play series.\n"}
{"title": "Ahsoka Revives Colin Trevorrow's Canceled Star Wars 9 Plan (But Makes It Even Bigger)", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Ahsoka's finale has revived plans from Colin Trevorrow's canceled plans for Episode 9, though it seems Dave Filoni intends to go even bigger.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka's finale episode looks to be reviving concepts from Colin Trevorrow's original plans for Star Wars' Episode 9. Originally titled Duel of the Fates, Trevorrow and his script were ultimately abandoned by Lucasfilm in favor of J.J Abrams returning with The Rise of Skywalker. Now, Ahsoka seems to be exploring some of the original ideas from the first script, albeit in a much bigger context thanks to showrunner Dave Filoni.\nAs seen in Ahsoka's finale episode, Grand Admiral Thrawn has successfully escaped from the extragalactic world of Peridea where he'd been exiled for years, having missed the entirety of the original trilogy's war between the Rebellion and Empire. While Jedi Ezra Bridger escaped Peridea disguised as a stormtrooper on Thrawn's ship, the titular Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice Sabine Wren didn't make it. However, Baylan Skoll chose to stay in search of greater power. As seen in the finale, Baylan discovered major connections to Mortis and the Force gods known as the Ones from The Clone Wars, an idea Trevorrow's Episode 9 would have connected with as well.\nIn Colin Trevorrow's Duel of the Fates, the original script released online in 2020 confirms Mortis would have played a major part in Episode 9. First seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano unintentionally come across this ethereal Force realm. There they meet the Father, Son, and Daughter, immortal gods representing different aspects of the Force itself. While the Daughter represented the light, the Son represented the dark. To that end, The Father was tasked with keeping his children in balance, acting as a fulcrum for the state of the Force in the galaxy overall.\nWhile The Clone Wars' three-episode arc on Mortis confirmed that Anakin Skywalker was the prophesied Chosen One who could have taken the Father's place, it also saw the aforementioned fulcrum being undone with the deaths of all three Force gods. Nevertheless, the realm would have been featured later on in the canon had Lucasfilm stuck with Colin Trevorrow and the original plan for Episode 9. After all, its key significance and strong connection to the origins of the Force itself would have more than justified its appearance in the culminating movie of the Skywalker saga, the perfect means of bridging the Star Wars timeline together across trilogies and eras.\nDuel of the Fates would have seen Rey experiencing a Force vision showing that she was meant to duel Kylo Ren on Mortis. As such, the bulk of Rey's role in this version of Episode 9 was to find the Force realm. After dueling the Knights of Ren and brushing with the dark side, Rey would have indeed faced Kylo on Mortis who'd become even more powerful in his own right. However, Rey would have eventually embraced both the light and dark, achieving true balance as neither Jedi nor Sith. Naturally, this would have been very powerful on Mortis given its own role in the Force's need for balance.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nNow, Ahsoka has brought back the Mortis gods in a pretty big way. Having confirmed to his apprentice Shin Hati in previous episodes of Ahsoka, something had been calling to Baylan ever since they came to Peridea. Baylan then went on his own to find this source of power he believed even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared, hence their alliance with Thrawn to leave the remains of their former witch kingdom behind. To that end, one of the final shots of Ahsoka's finale sees Baylan discovering massive statues of the Father and Son along with the destroyed remains of the Daughter.\nThese Force god statues clearly point to a major connection between Peridea and Mortis. However, it could also be more than that. After all, it was confirmed in previous episodes that Peridea was but one name the. myths and legends had given to the Nightsisters' original homeworld. As such, the possibility exists that Peridea and Mortis are one and the same in the Star Wars canon. Furthermore, Obi-Wan did say in The Clone Wars that he couldn't determine where in the galaxy they were or if they were even still in their own galaxy after they were drawn to Mortis by the Father. This does fit with Peridea existing in another galaxy.\nAt the very least, Peridea was a world that was known to the Mortis gods who were likely worshiped by its residents (perhaps even by the Nightsisters). If Peridea and Mortis are later revealed to be separate planets, it follows there could still be points of access to Mortis on the planet itself, potentially providing Ahsoka and Sabine with a new means of escaping the extragalactic world. However, it's also possible that Peridea has a major connection to the Force gods' Legends history and a horrifying new threat to the Star Wars galaxy.\nFollowing this major Mortis reveal in Ahsoka's finale, it's clear that Star Wars is likely setting up returns for The Father, Son, and Daughter in some way. If not them, then perhaps the Mother from Legends who became corrupted as the Force entity known as Abeloth, a being of complete entropy and chaos. Having been imprisoned and contained by the Force gods for millennia, Legends saw Abeloth breaking free in the wake of their deaths and becoming a major threat during the New Republic era.\nKeeping that in mind, perhaps Abeloth is the great power of legend who's been calling out to Baylan. She'd certainly be big enough to scare the Nightsisters' Great Mothers. Seeing as how Abeloth wanted to wipe out the entire galaxy in order to create a new one, perhaps Baylan is seeking her power in his mission to end the galaxy's never-ending cycle of conflict between the light and dark. Naturally, re-canonizing and adapting Abeloth and her history with the Mortis gods would be huge for the Star Wars franchise.\nIt's very important that Ahsoka is now stranded on Peridea as well, seeing as how she carries the essence of the Daughter within her as seen in The Clone Wars season 3. It's why the Daughter's convor owl named Morai has watched over Ahsoka ever since, having made multiple appearances across Tano's journey (including Ahsoka's final episode). As such, seeing Morai on Peridea is a very strong sign that Ahsoka and her apprentice are destined to be on Peridea (to likely stop Baylan).\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nIt's very exciting that Ahsoka is reviving the idea of using Mortis and the Force gods in live-action after Duel of the Fates was canceled. However, it's quite evident by this setup alone that Filoni's plans will be much bigger in scale and scope than Trevorrow's were for Episode 9. While Trevorrow's concept sounded quite good, it's for the best that Filoni is continuing the concepts of Mortis and the Force gods instead, having conceived their inception in the first place. If Star Wars is going to do a new Mortis story in any form, it's hard to beat Dave Filoni being the one behind the Ones.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Jacob Elordi's Elvis Presley Is Already Beating Austin Butler In One Big Way", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Austin Butler almost nabbed an Oscar for playing Elvis Presley, but Jacob Elordi's portrayal as the King of Rock in Priscilla could be even better.\nPriscilla is the upcoming biopic about Elvis Presley's wife from Sofia Coppola, and Jacob Elordi already seems like a better Elvis than Austin Butler in one specific way. As the title alludes, the biopic focuses on Elvis's wife more than the King of Rock himself, and it explores the toxic relationship between the couple that most other media about them has often sidestepped. In the new movie, Elvis is depicted as a villain, throwing chairs at walls and trying to take control of Priscilla's whole look, even down to how much eye makeup she wears. Priscilla ultimately wants to be her own person.\nPriscilla follows the 2022 hit Elvis, though they're completely different films with different approaches to the same real-life people. Where the Priscilla trailer showcases a harrowing drama, Elvis focused as much on the spectacle of Elvis Presley's life with some thrilling musical sequences. However, it's impossible not to compare the two, especially as their release dates are so close to each other (Elvis was released in July 2022 and Priscilla is out on November 3, 2023). The 2023 movie doesn't shy away from the facts that Baz Luhrmann's Elvis tried to hide, but there's one major comparison between the two movies, and that's Jacob Elordi and Austin Butler's voices.\nBased on the Priscilla trailer, Jacob Elordi's voice already sounds better than Austin Butler's. Elordi's voice sounds more realistic, authentic, and natural compared to Butler's. Butler's Elvis voice sometimes felt like an impression of the King of Rock with all the \"uh-huhs,\" though that still worked because of how intentionally theatrical and over-the-top Elvis is. Interestingly, while Elordi's voice sounds more natural, Butler spent two years in vocal training just to sound like Elvis. Ironically, Butler has been struggling to drop the Elvis accent (via Variety), and it was only eight months after Elvis' release when Butler finally started losing that accent.\nPriscilla isn't Elvis' movie and, in fact, Elvis is something of a villain in the film. The movie doesn't shy away from some dark facts, such as the Elvis and Priscilla age gap - Priscilla was just 14 years old when she met the 24-year-old King of Rock - and there are shots of the young girl learning in school to emphasize exactly that. Nevertheless, while there's no denying that Butler was great as Elvis Presley in the 2022 movie and totally deserved the Academy Award nomination, based on the trailer, Elordi's Elvis is already looking like he could be the better of the two 2020s on-screen Elvises.\nNevertheless, while Jacob Elordi might outdo Austin Butler in some instances, it's a completely different performance. Elordi doesn't have to perform in the same way that Butler did, and Elordi's performance is on a much smaller scale. Ultimately, they're both extremely different portrayals of the same character and while Elordi might excel in some dramatic areas, the Priscilla actor isn't required to commit to the role in the way that Butler did. There's plenty of room on the cinema landscape for two great Elvis performances.\nSource: Variety\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

{"title": "Flash Just Lost Access to His Most Overpowered Ability (& That's a Good Thing)", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Wally West is the Fastest Man Alive, but a new glitch with his powers means that the Scarlet Speedster needs to think faster than he can run.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for The Flash #1\nAs the Fastest Man Alive, the Scarlet Speedster known as the Flash is by far one of the most overpowered characters in the DC Universe — but now he's lost one of his most powerful abilities. Wally West's intense connection to the Speed Force makes him a conduit to a powerful and other-dimensional plane of energy that nobody truly understands. Unfortunately for the Flash, that lack of understanding seems to be coming back to haunt him now that the mysterious Force has seemingly robbed him of one of his most world-breaking powers.\nThe Flash #1 by Si Spurrier, Mike Deodato Jr., Trish Mulvihill, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou opens with two non-titular speedsters – Max Mercury and Impulse – seeking to transcend time and space, as Max has done many times before, using the Speed Force. Unexpectedly, the Speed Force instantly rejects them, hurtling them back with an unexpected ferocity and apparently closing the door on the Flash Family’s dimension-hopping and time-traveling capabilities.\nBased on Wally’s tempestuous relationship with the Speed Force seen throughout the rest of the issue, it’s clear that the Flash is in a dangerous new era of his career as the protector of Keystone and Central City.\nRelated: Flash's New Villains Put a Sick Twist on the Entire Flash-Family\nIn this very issue, the Flash’s ally and employer, Mr. Terrific, tells the hero that “thinking sideways” will get them through their current crisis, and with Wally’s powers on the fritz, that seems to be exactly what he’ll have to do. Wally notoriously hates time travel, and, in the DC Universe, changing the past very rarely has any positive repercussions. Despite all that, that the Flash can always turn back the clock when things don’t go his way has always hung over the character and affected the stakes of his stories. Now that his powers are more erratic than ever, there’s no chance for a do-over should things go wrong for the Crimson Comet, raising the stakes for both Wally and the audience.\nAside from speed, the heroes who have used the mantle of the Flash have always been known for their unique perspective and their abilities to think outside the box. Whether it’s Barry Allen with his famous Flash Facts or Wally’s more instinctual and borderline-mystical connection with the Speed Force, the Flashes’ ability to always use their powers creatively to outsmart dangerous foes is inherent to the Flash Family legacy. Clearly, these heroes are no strangers to thinking sideways, and, as Mr. Terrific says, that’s exactly what Wally West will need to hone that creative edge more than ever — especially if the Speed Force continues to glitch.\nThe Flash is the Fastest Man Alive, but even he has to slow down every now and then. Now that the Speed Force is cracking down on Wally West’s overpowered nature, the stakes are incredibly high for Wally, Max, Impulse, and the rest of the Flash Family. Whether these fan-favorite speedsters ever fully regain their reality-distorting abilities remains to be seen, but until then, the Flash is going to have to think even faster than he can run.\nThe Flash #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;His Brain Looks Like Bubblegum&quot;: Homer Simpson's Treehouse Of Horror Injuries Examined By Medical Expert", "date": "2023-10-04 20:25:29", "text": "A real-life ER doctor reacts to The Simpsons season 13 episode, \"Treehouse of Horror XII,\" examining Homer's bubblegum-looking brain injury.\nHomer Simpson’s injuries in The Simpsons episode, “Treehouse of Horror XII,” are analyzed by a real doctor. Released roughly around Halloween, “Treehouse of Horror” is a series of horror-spoof episodes originating in season 2 and has since become an annual event on The Simpsons. At the time of writing, there are a total of 34 “Treehouse of Horror” episodes in the show's entire run. A sought-after annual entry in the comedy show, the episodes are known for their deployment of movie parody and animation experimentation.\nIn a reaction video from Doctor ER, a real physician examines one such “Treehouse of Horror XII” episode from The Simpsons season 13, explaining the realism (and lack thereof). Breaking down the components of the “Ultrahouse 3000” clip, ER Docter Jordan Wagner explains the extent to which Homer could have gotten hurt due to his sleepwalking. Then, Dr. Wagner details the inaccuracies of the bright pink, pulsing brain portrayed in the episode, which he described as looking “like bubblegum.” Wagner revealed that in his experience, brain matter is more often “grayish, white tissue that’s super soft and super fragile.” Check out the full quote from Wagner below:\n“People do sleepwalk. You have to be careful with that. Some people are a little bit more apt to doing that than others.\nBeing jammed into the edge of the table, depending on where you get hit, you can actually injure your groin. You can actually cause bruising to the lower abdomen, and you can also cause injury to the internal organs depending on how hard you hit into the table.\nOh my god! His brain looks like bubblegum. His brain is out, so everybody can see skull fractures. It wouldn't be necessarily bulging like that. If this does occur, you probably want to have some like wet gauze, something sterile, wet to cover the area and get that person to the hospital ASAP. Oh my gosh, the brain is still hanging out. I’ve seen many injuries, and a lot of brain matter. It’s grayish, white tissue that’s super soft and super fragile. Back of the head, typically it’s the visual cortex area. Also has to do with the balance center of the brain, so you’re going to be off and feel like you have vertigo. Things might not be working correctly. You might have an inability to do certain movements correctly.”\nAs expected from a cartoon take on the brain, The Simpsons plays into visual conventions in this sequence. Much like the commonly portrayed heart shape, the brain is often depicted as a pinkish quality. The Simpsons play into this misleading stereotype, making Homer’s brain appear “bubblegum” pink. This makes sense given the show's comedic sensibilities, and Homer’s exposed brain is immediately identifiable as such despite the anatomical inaccuracies.\nFor all its misrepresentation of the medical details, “Treehouse of Horror XII” has some brilliant parody elements that cement it as one of the best in the perennial show. In this “Ultrahouse 3000” segment, Homer and his family live in a fully automated, futuristic house. This house is manned by a central operating system with voice options, including a “Pierce Brosnan” option, voiced by the actor himself. This mechanism mocks the classic sci-fi movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose HAL-9000 operates using similar functions.\nRelated: The Simpsons Pennywise Spoof References A Classic Treehouse of Horror \nThe 2001: A Space Odyssey parody is one of many in the “Treehouse of Horror” series. Originating from a Poltergeist and Amityville Horror spoof, the “Treehouse of Horror” episodes took on everything from Soylent Green to Frankenstein. As is common in The Simpsons, these Halloween episodes prove the show’s ability to pay homage to a vast array of works within movie and TV history. In that regard, “Treehouse of Horror XII” is an archetypical example of the high level at which The Simpsons operates.\nSource: Doctor ER\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Korean Shows On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-04 20:20:27", "text": "From worldwide hits like Squid Game and All of Us Are Dead to hidden gems from all genres, here are the best Korean shows on Netflix right now.\nThe best Korean show on Netflix includes heavy dramas, action-packed adventures, sci-fi tales, and romantic comedies. Korean TV shows have been among the most successful and well-received works of fiction globally for several years now. Thanks to the streaming era, watching the best K-dramas from anywhere in the world is now far easier, which allows incredible stories and great actors to reach an even bigger audience. From massive pop culture hits like Squid Game to hidden gems, Netflix has some of the best Korean TV shows currently available.\nK-drama episodes tend to be significantly long, with some shows including 60-minute or even 90-minute-long episodes. That said, even successful shows tend not to go on for multiple seasons and are instead wrapped up in a couple of series, which can be helpful for those who are looking for titles to binge. There are great Korean dramas from almost every genre, not to mention series that combine two or three different styles. Here are the 10 best Korean shows on Netflix right now.\nGenre: Romance, Sci-Fi\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Ahn Hyo-seop (Koo Yeon-jun / Nam Si-heon), Jeon Yeo-been (Han Jun-hee / Kwon Min-ju), Kang Hoon (Jung In-gyu)\nOne of the latest K-drama releases on Netflix, A Time Called You is also one of the best K-dramas about time travel. Jun-hee has just lost her boyfriend, Yeon-jun, who was about to become her fiancé, in a plane crash. The character is still grieving when a series of strange encounters begin to happen, leading her to investigate Yeon-jun’s past. What could be just a story about overcoming grief and solving mysteries takes a fantastical turn when Jun-hee somehow wakes up 25 years in the past in the body of a different person. A Time Called You is emotional, instigating, and full of twists that will get viewers theorizing in every single episode.\nRelated: A Time Called You's Ending & Time Travel Explained\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Hyun Bin Ri (Jeong-hyuk), Son Ye-jin (Yoon Se-ri)\nThe life of Se-ri, one of South Korea’s most successful CEOs, takes an unexpected turn after a paragliding accident. Se-ri accidentally lands in North Korea and is unable to cross the border. She is found by a group of North Korean soldiers, one of whom believes her story and agrees to help her as much as possible. Se-ri’s energy and naivety compared to Jeong-hyuk’s seriousness makes for a hilarious contrast that sets up an unpredictable love story. Crash Landing on You includes some classic love story tropes, such as “fake dating,” in a Romeo and Juliet-like story that is funny, charming, and emotional.\nGenre: Comedy, legal drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Park Eun-bin (Woo Young-woo), Kang Tae-oh (Lee Jun-ho), Kang Ki-young (Jung Myung-seok)\nWoo Young-woo is an Autistic lawyer who graduated as the best of her class and is about to enter a new phase in her career. The character joins a law firm as a trainee, during which she meets new friends and foes. While Extraordinary Attorney Woo tells an overarching story, the show does have an episodic nature in which Woo Young-woo will go from case to case. With engaging pacing and fun cases that will show how incredible of a lawyer Woo Young-woo, Extraordinary Attorney Woo is one of the best legal dramas on TV right now. The show also includes comedy and love stories.\nGenre: Drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Song Hye-kyo (Moon Dong-eun), Jung Ji-so (young Dong-eun), Lee Do-hyun (Joo Yeo-jeong), Lim Ji-yeon (Park Yeon-jin), Shin Ye-eun (young Yeon-jin)\nThe Glory, a TV-MA-rated show, deals with heavy themes and is one of the darkest, most violent dramas on Netflix. It follows the story of Moon Dong-eun, who suffered bullying during her school years. The Glory sees Dong-eun as an adult who returns to her hometown seeking revenge against those who hurt her in the past. The show intercalates Dong-eun’s quest for revenge with flashbacks that showcase everything she went through during school. While some of The Glory scenes may be too heavy, the show acknowledges the dangers of bullying in a thrilling story that is also full of twists.\nGenre: Horror\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Song Kang (Cha Hyun-soo), Lee Jin-wook (Pyeon Sang-wook), Lee Si-young (Seo Yi-kyung), Go Min-si (Lee Eun-yoo)\nFor those who may already be tired of zombie movies and TV shows, Sweet Home is a great pick. The show reinvents the post-apocalyptic format with a story about how to survive a “monster apocalypse” that is different from the classic zombie tropes. After a massive tragedy changes the course of Cha Hyun-soo’s life, this recluse teenager finds himself in a city taken over by monsters. Sweet Home is action-packed and features some solid visual effects, and all of the characters are interesting and engaging. Sweet Home was one of the first major Netflix Korean drama hits, and Sweet Home season 2 is set to premiere in 2023.\nGenre: Romance, Fantasy\nAvailable seasons: 1-2\nCast: Lee Jae-wook (Jang Uk), Jung So-min (Mu-deok / Nak-su), Hwang Min-hyun (Seo Yu)\nAlchemy of Souls invites audiences to a world full of magic and action. With 30 episodes between seasons 1 and 2, Alchemy of Souls features extensive worldbuilding and includes dozens of characters. That said, the story is centered on Mu-deok, a legendary warrior who accidentally has her soul sent to the body of a far weaker person, Nak-su. She then starts to work as a servant for Jang Uk, the heir to a wealthy family. Alchemy of Souls’ visuals, characters, and lore all add to a love story that discusses themes like honoring, belonging, and fate. Presumably, Alchemy of Souls Part 2 was the end of the story.\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Ahn Hyo-seop (Kang Tae-moo), Kim Se-jeong (Shin Ha-ri)\nFeaturing one of the best K-drama couples in a story full of charming tropes, Business Proposal is a great romantic comedy. Shin Ha-ri replaces her friend on a blind date with specific plans of getting rejected, only to discover the date in question is her boss. Kang Tae-moo is not aware that Ha-Ri is one of his company’s employees, let alone that she is not the person she is claiming to be. To make things more complicated, Tae-moo wants to enter a fake relationship, so that his father will stop arranging blind dates for him. This sets up a hilarious, entertaining show full of sweet moments.\nGenre: Horror, Fantasy\nAvailable seasons: 1-2\nCast: Ju Ji-Hoon (Lee Chang), Bae Doo-Na (Seo-Bi), Ryoo Seung-Ryong (Jo Hak-Joo)\nKingdom is another example of how there can still be fresh, original zombie stories. The show, which is set in the 16th century during Korea’s Joseon period, can be considered a manga adaptation loosely based on Kingdom of the Gods. Crown Prince Lee Chang is tasked with investigating a mysterious disease that is spreading across the kingdom and has already contaminated the king.What could be just a political thriller about conspiracies within the kingdom becomes a monster story when Lee Chang discovers what this virus has done to his father. Scary and action-packed, Kingdom combines horror and fantasy in one of the best Korean shows on Netflix.\nGenre: Horror\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Park Ji-hu (Nam On-jo), Yoon Chan-young (Lee Cheong-san), Cho Yi-hyun (Choi Nam-ra), Lomon (Lee Su-hyeok)\nAll of Us Are Dead can be seen as just another zombie show at first. However, despite the simple premise of a zombie outbreak that has just started, All of Us Are Dead is one of the most entertaining zombie series and one of the best Korean dramas on Netflix in general. The buildup to the zombie outbreak is done incredibly well, and the idea of following a strict set of characters inside just one location for multiple episodes was perfectly executed. All of Us Are Dead’s characters are part of what makes the show great, and the first season works as a standalone story despite an already confirmed season 2.\nGenre: Drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun, Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo), Wi Ha-joon (Hwang Jun-ho), Jung Ho-yeon (Kang Sae-byeok).\nSquid Game, themost-watched Netflix show of all time, became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to its engaging, original story about a group of people who accept playing deadly games for a massive amount of cash. From the classic games turned into horrific killing sprees to relatable characters struggling with financial issues, Squid Game connected with audiences from all over the world. The simple premise combined with fast-paced episodes and great performances makes Squid Game one of the best Korean shows on Netflix and a must-see for those who haven’t already, especially because Squid Game season 2 is happening.\n"}
{"title": "How Napoleon's Large-Scale French Battle Rivals Gladiator's Epicness", "date": "2023-10-04 20:14:26", "text": "A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s Napoleon teases the film’s massive practical battle sequences that rival the major battle scenes from Gladiator.\nRidley Scott hypes Napoleon's upcoming practical battle sequences in a new trailer for the upcoming historical epic, and it looks like they're just as epic as Gladiator's. Scott's upcoming collaboration with Apple sees the director chronicling the life, career, and military exploits of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. After first directing him in 2000's Gladiator, Scott reunites with Joaquin Phoenix for the film, with the actor playing the titular role.\nNow, as the Napoleon release date approaches, Sony Pictures Entertainment has released a new featurette-style trailer for the movie, revealing how Scott pulled off the large-scale battle sequences. The film seemingly relied heavily on practical methods, with the director revealing that filming one battle involved \"300 men and a hundred horses.\" Check out the trailer below:\nRelated: Ridley Scott's Epic New Movie Is Flipping What Made Gladiator A $500 Million Success\nGladiator features a number of big fight sequences, with the opening one perhaps being the largest of them all. The film begins with Russell Crowe's Maximus leading the Roman Army against a Barbarian horde in Germania, and the sequence is complete with a horse charge, chaotic sword fighting in the mud, and explosive firebombs. The rest of the film is similarly action-packed, but many of the sequences are somewhat smaller in scale and a little more contained, with Maximus and his companions facing off against various threats within the Colosseum.\nNapoleon, on the other hand, appears like it might have more of a focus on large-scale battles than Gladiator did. Trailers for the movie have already provided a fairly good indication of the types of battle scenes to come, with Napoleon's Russia campaign, in particular, serving as the backdrop for much of the action. Imagines were recently released, for example, of Napoleon leading his army through a burning Moscow.\nThe Battle of Austerlitz, too, has been teased fairly extensively in the film's marketing. The battle, which was one of the most tactically impressive battles that Napoleon ever waged, famously features the French military commander using cannons to break the ice beneath retreating Russian soldiers. It remains to be seen whether Napoleon's battles will exceed what Scott did previously in Gladiator, but the latest trailer is certainly a promising sign that the movie will be truly epic in scale.\nSource: Sony Pictures Entertainment/ YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Superman: Legacy Risks Repeating The Snyderverse's Big Batman Problem", "date": "2023-10-04 20:10:26", "text": "Superman: Legacy will repeat one narrative trick the DCEU used with Batman. However, doing so comes with risks the franchise surely wants to avoid.\nSuperman: Legacy will officially kick-start the new DC Universe continuity on the big screen when it releases in 2025, and James Gunn's reboot is emulating a Batman narrative decision from Zack Snyder's DCEU. Not much is yet known about Superman: Legacy, though casting details have started to emerge, confirming several heroes like Green Lantern and Hawkgirl who will officially enter the DCU canon with their appearance. Of course, the focus will be on Clark Kent and his adventures as Superman.\nPlot details for Clark's next big-screen adventure are still being held under wraps, but we do know that Superman: Legacy won't re-tell Superman's origin story. Per Gunn, who is writing and directing the movie, \"I think we've seen his origin enough in film at this time!\" While the DCEU does show Bruce Wayne's parents getting shot, it does skip his backstory of becoming the version of Batman seen on screen. While it was likely smart to streamline the introduction of a familiar character like Bruce, it also introduced a few problems that Superman: Legacy will want to avoid.\nBatman has starred in enough beloved movies and TV shows that viewers can be reasonably expected to know who he is, why he does what he does, and how he operates as The Dark Knight. Because of this, and because Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne was introduced in a team-up movie instead of his own solo project, the DCEU presented a truncated version of Bruce's backstory. However, since Affleck is shown as a Batman late in his career, most of his work is left up to the imagination. For the most part, this isn't a problem. However, it also meant that certain DCEU character changes were never fully explored.\nNotably, the Batman presented in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is overly violent and jaded, a far cry from the intense but compassionate Bruce normally seen in DC media. Hints are dropped as to why this may be, such as the costume of a dead Robin in the Batcave, but by skimming over important elements of backstory, some of Bruce's characterization comes off as unwarranted, unearned, and unexplained. If Superman: Legacy wants to avoid similar characterization confusion, it must be more careful with what parts of Clark's backstory it chooses to leave out.\nThough his backstory may not quite be as ubiquitous in pop culture as Batman's, the big beats behind who Superman is are similarly known. Enough movies and TV shows have shown or mentioned the destruction of Krypton and why Clark is on Earth that Gunn is correct about it not being necessary to show again. However, given that Man of Steel is the most recent big-screen project to cover Kal-El's youth and that the movie takes big liberties with important plot beats, some might be risky to skip. Most notably, Man of Steel presented a controversial Jonathan Kent, one who was less optimistic and inspiring and more paranoid and unsure.\nRelated: Every Actor Cast In Superman Legacy (So Far)\nWhile Superman: Legacy's story doesn't need to show the destruction of Krypton, Kal-El crash-landing on Earth, or the Kent's raising Clark, his adoptive parents being a positive and formative impact on who he is may be important context for the older Clark seen in the movie. Of course, there are other options. Clark may still have a close and meaningful relationship with one or both parents in Superman: Legacy, or he could reminisce about their time together even without showing them on-screen.\nSuperman: Legacy will also benefit from the fact that Superman's background simply isn't as important to explore in detail as that of an older Batman in the DCEU. While broad strokes about where Clark is from are foundational elements of his person, he doesn't need a complicated chain of events to explain his optimism and belief in the potential of humanity to do good. At his best, Superman is guided by a relatively simple set of morals and ethics that drive him to be as good as he can be, and that's easy to understand.\nAffleck's Batman was presented as a markedly different character than most interpretations in DC Comics. While that was a good thing in many ways, it also raised valid questions about what happened to him that simply weren't answered. Unless Superman: Legacy plans to make dramatic changes to who Clark Kent is as a person, it should be just fine keeping his backstory to a minimum.\n"}
{"title": "Should You Give Your Heart To Geppetto In Lies Of P?", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "Near the end of Lies of P, Gepetto asks for your heart. Whether you give it to him determines what happens next, as well as the game’s ending.\nOne of the final scenes of Lies of P forces Pinocchio to decide whether to turn over his heart to his creator, Gepetto. Pinocchio's mechanical heart, the P-Organ, is part of what allows him to walk the line between puppet and real boy, exploring the desolate city of Krat as a freestanding automaton with a sense of will. It also functions as a complex, customizable skill tree, allowing players to upgrade the P-Organ throughout Lies of P to gain new skills and upgrade stats.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for all possible endings of Lies of P.]\nLies of P reaches its climax when Pinocchio storms the Isle of Alchemists and defeats the sinister faction's leader, Simon Manus, in what may be the game's final boss fight. He takes a lift down to a subterranean chamber, where Gepetto stands in wait. He greets his creation, and coos over the terrible ordeal he put Pinocchio through. He promises to put a stop to it; but first, he just needs Pinocchio's heart. There are two dialogue options here: \"Give your heart,\" or \"Refuse.\" This choice directly affects what happens next, and the ending after.\nRelated: Lies Of P: Should You Kill Alidoro?\nRegardless of any other choices made throughout the game, giving Gepetto the P-Organ always results in the same, \"Real Boy\" ending to the game. And that ending begins immediately. Gepetto praises Pinocchio's good behavior, and calls him the greatest puppet he ever made. He promises to turn Pinocchio into a real boy and leave Krat with him, before abruptly and violently removing his heart. Pinocchio crumples to the ground, but remains conscious; he watches as Gepetto tinkers with the P-Organ in his toolbox.\nThe scene fades to black, and then up again on a rainy night under the neon sign of Hotel Krat. Gepetto waits beneath the arch of the hotel doorway, a pile of luggage beside him. A bloodstained Pinocchio emerges, sees his creator, and smiles warmly. Gepetto smiles back with a heavy sigh, as he remarks on how he finally sees Pinocchio as his son. It's a happy ending, sure, but there are some nagging doubts. In a voiceover, Sophia asks, \"Is this truly the future you wanted?\"\nThere are still a few things players can do after beating Lies of P, even with this abrupt ending. Pinocchio can return to Hotel Krat, listen to any available Records, chat with NPCs, and play the piano for an easy achievement. However, besides a slightly disappointing, dubiously happy ending, there's not much else that giving Gepetto the heart unlocks.\nThings get a little more complicated if Pinocchio refuses. What happens here depends on a number of choices made throughout the game, not least of which are those that make up Lies of P's Truth and Lie system. Several important plot points come down to a simple decision between telling the truth and lying, and each time Pinocchio lies, additional points are added onto a hidden measure of his humanity. There are other important choices in Lies of P, to be sure, but the morality and humanity of lies are the main determining factors in how the game ends - along with whether Pinocchio gives Gepetto his heart.\nIf Pinocchio has primarily told the truth, and spared Sophia when he met her on the Isle of Alchemists, players will see the \"Free from the Puppet String\" ending after refusing Gepetto. Once they refuse, Gepetto's words of praise turn to admonishment. He calls Pinocchio useless, and resigns to take the P-Organ for himself. Gepetto then summons Nameless Puppet, a faceless marionette who serves as Lies of P's secret final boss.\nPinocchio and the Nameless Puppet spar, but as soon as it seems like Pinocchio has gained the upper hand, the Nameless Puppet knocks him to the ground and lines up a killing blow. However, Gepetto steps in front of its sword. He dies in Pinocchio's arms with one final insult. Pinocchio destroys the Nameless Puppet's heart, and the game ends on the spot.\nHowever, on New Game Plus, if Pinocchio has primarily lied, gave Sophia peace in death, and stolen the painting \"Portrait of a Boy\" from the Black Rabbit Brotherhood, he can unlock another ending, \"Rise of P.\" However, he must return to the hotel after beating Simon Manus, listen to all the Records in Lies of P, and examine the portrait. He notices the image's elongated nose, and can pry it out of the painting to use it as a weapon: the Golden Lie.\nPinocchio may then return to Gepetto and refuse to give him the heart. The final boss battle is much the same, except Gepetto compares the deceitful Pinocchio to his human son Carlo, and apologizes to him instead of scolding him. However, this does unlock a unique epilogue in which Pinocchio restores Sophia to life, transferring her Ergo and consciousness into a puppet body.\nThe best way to negotiate the Gepetto decision is to give him Pinocchio's heart the first time, and refuse him every time after. Those who want to see all possible endings will need to play through the game at least twice. That's because unlocking the \"Rise of P\" ending requires Pinocchio to collect and listen to all the Records in the game, and some of them are only available by making a one-time choice. For example, lying to Eugénie about Alidoro's identity grants him one Record, while telling the truth grants him a different one.\nTherefore, the most efficient way to see all three endings is to always tell the truth and spare Sophia on a first playthrough, then agree to give Gepetto the heart. After watching the \"Real Boy\" ending, players can load their most recent save file and refuse Gepetto to see the \"Free from the Puppet String\" ending. Finally, they can start a NG+, always lie, and kill Sophia to see the \"Rise of P\" ending.\nBut even for those who don't plan on completing NG+ to see that final ending, it's still worth giving up the heart, then reloading and refusing to see both options. Appeasing Gepetto ends the game in about two minutes, and creates an interesting character moment where Pinocchio questions whether he wants more than just humanity. Then, returning to the pivotal moment and trying the other option unlocks an extra boss and a somewhat more satisfying ending. This way, players can experience the best of both worlds in Lies of P.\n"}

Debuting in 2011, Bob’s Burgers quickly set itself apart from other animated sitcoms thanks to its uncanny ability to make even the most bombastic and wild plotlines seem grounded. Despite its surreal sensibilities the show is completely relatable and feels far closer in tone (somehow) to both King of the Hill and The Simpsons than South Park or Family Guy. After over a decade on the air Bob’s Burgers shows no signs of ending soon, and season 15 has been confirmed by Fox.\nWhile details on the next season of Bob’s Burgers after the current run are scarce, there’s still plenty to discuss around the show’s future. Since Fox was acquired by Disney in 2019, Bob and the rest of the Belcher’s have received a movie and a streaming home on platform Hulu. The future likely has much more in store for Bob, Linda, Jean, Tina, and Louise, and it will start with the upcoming Bob’s Burgers season 15.\nWhile there haven’t been any major updates on the development of Bob’s Burgers season 15 since the renewal was confirmed in January 2023, this is largely due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Not only was development on the next season of Bob’s Burgers likely put on hold while both the writers and actors unions negotiated a deal for fair working condition with the AMPTP, but both the cast and screenwriters couldn’t promote the show.\nNow that the WGA have reached an agreement with the ATMPTP, with the SAG-AFTRA dispute expected to be resolved soon, it’s likely that more news on Bob’s Burgers season 15 will shortly follow. The current season of Bob’s Burgers only debuted in October, so once the finale airs more updates on season 15 may come soon after.\nFox renewed Bob’s Burgers for season 15 in January 2023, alongside the 14th season. The confirmation of two more Bob’s Burgers seasons came alongside commissioning more episodes of fellow Fox animation powerhouses Family Guy and The Simpsons. \n The official Bob’s Burgers Twitter account celebrated the renewal with a photo of Louise, Tina, and Jean skipping. Fox Entertainment President of Scripted Programming Michael Thorn spoke highly of the renewal at the time (via Collider):\n\n\"With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, longtime partnership with 20th Television, and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites. Three-plus decades of 'The Simpsons,' more than two decades of 'Family Guy,' and over a decade of 'Bob's Burgers' proves the enduring power of the animation genre on our network and the infinite fan affinity for these outrageously funny comedy classics.\"\n\n\"With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, longtime partnership with 20th Television, and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites. Three-plus decades of 'The Simpsons,' more than two decades of 'Family Guy,' and over a decade of 'Bob's Burgers' proves the enduring power of the animation genre on our network and the infinite fan affinity for these outrageously funny comedy classics.\"\nThere’s no official release date for Bob’s Burgers season 15 yet. It’s expected to arrive in the fall 2024 season, possibly in October. From the ninth onwards new seasons of Bob’s Burgers have consisted of 22 episodes, released weekly on Fox. Should season 15 follow the same pattern it will keep Bob’s Burgers on the air until 2025.\nThere have been no announced cast changes yet for Bob’s Burgers season 15. There aren’t any expected either, as the show has managed to keep its core roster of voice actors throughout. Provided there aren’t any unexpected exits in the interim, the cast of Bob’s Burgers season 15 is expected to include:\nJoining the Belchers (and Teddy) for Bob’s Burgers season 15 will also include many returning cast members who voice multiple supporting characters on the show. These include Kevin Kline as Mr. Fischoeder, Zach Galifianakis as his brother Felix, and Laura and Sarah Silverman as twins Andy and Aolly. Megan Mullally will also likely feature heavily as Linda’s sister Gayle.\nThere have been multiple celebrity cameos and guest appearances over the years as the show gained momentum on Fox. The cast of Bob’s Burgers season 15 will also likey include from guest-stars, though none have been revealed.\nNone of the plots or story threads from Bob’s Burgers season 15 have been revealed yet. It’s also quite possible that the scripts haven’t yet been written, given the WGA strike in 2023. Once the episode titles of the next season of Bob’s Burgers have been shared by Fox, along with a trailer, what awaits the Belchers when they return will become much clearer. Until then, however, the storylines in Bob’s Burgers season 15 are a total mystery.\n"}
{"title": "The Simpsons Season 36: Renewal, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "The Simpsons season 36 will carry Springfield's most famous family through into 2025, and here's everything we know about the show's return on Fox.\nThe Simpsons season 36 will bring the most recognizable animated family in TV history through to the 2024-2025 period, and with over 750 episodes behind it the show doesn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon. Debuting on Fox in 1989, The Simpsons is one of the longest running TV shows currently on the air. It quickly became one of the most successful shows in the network's history, surviving until Disney purchased Fox in 2019. Now one of the tent pole franchises for the House of Mouse, The Simpsons is still going strong, with season 36 already confirmed and on the way.\nWhile there’s not much known about The Simpsons season 36 yet, anticipation is already high. New episodes of The Simpsons since the Disney acquisition have widely been regarded as being an uptick in quality for the show, with season 34 in particular being well received by fans and critics. With no signs of the show losing momentum anytime soon there’s plenty to digest when it comes to The Simpsons season 36.\nThere haven’t been any huge updates on The Simpsons season 36 since the news broke in January 2023 that Fox had renewed the show for another two seasons. However, there are two main reasons for this — the 35th season arriving first, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meaning a general lack of promotion of in-development projects throughout 2023. Once the current run concludes there will likely be more information available about the 36th season of The Simpsons.\nThe Simpsons has been renewed for season 36. The renewal announcement came in January 2023 when Fox confirmed they’d greenlit The Simpsons for two seasons, which would extend the run of the show into 2025.\nThe release date for The Simpsons season 36 hasn’t yet been announced by Fox or parent company Disney. Previous seasons of The Simpsons have premiered on or close to the start of October, so a fall 2024 release window for the 36th season of the show is likely.\nUnless there are any surprise recasts, sudden exits, or tragic news like the passing of Marcia Wallace in 2013, the cast of The Simpsons season 36 will be unchanged from prior seasons of the show. This means the cast can be expected to include:\nThe cast of The Simpsons is also known for many celebrity and guest star cameos. The Simpsons season 36 will be no exception, although there haven’t been any reveals yet about who’s the next famous face to make a debut in Springfield.\nThere haven’t been any details yet revealed about what episodes are in The Simpsons season 36. The show has been going on so long that what the episode plots might be is unpredictable, but it might rehash or revisit former storylines (while being self-aware and lambasting itself for doing so, of course). While The Simpsons revisiting former episodes is always a risk, the show has been going so long that it’s inevitable plots focused around callbacks to stories from literally decades ago are going to appear, and the 36th season is no exception.\nIt’s expected that The Simpsons season 36 will feature Treehouse Of Horror XXXV, the infamous Simpsons Halloween special, though nothing’s been teased about which popular horror movies the citizens of Springfield will parody in The Simpsons season 36. The current season of the show is also set to feature the return of Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammar), who hasn’t been seen for several years. It’s possible that The Simpsons season 36 will also bring back some former characters from the extensive history of the show for some new storylines.\n"}
{"title": "Mortis Gods Explained: Star Wars History, Powers, Planet & Importance", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "The Mortis gods are some of Star Wars’ most powerful Force-wielders, and Dave Filoni is using them to unite The Clone Wars, Rebels, and now Ahsoka.\nWarning! This article contains SPOILERS for the Ahsoka finale.\nStar Wars has introduced three powerful beings, the Mortis gods, who look increasing important after Ahsoka. The true nature and origin of the Force has always been a mystery in Star Wars, but it is clearly tied to mysterious beings known as the Mortis gods - beings venerated on Peridea, a planet situated in a distant galaxy. These seem to be tied to the mysterious agenda of dark Jedi Baylan Skoll, suggesting they will be extremely important going forward.\nPreviously, Mortis was thought to be a mystical realm that was separate from the Star Wars universe, much like the World Between Worlds. Nevertheless, depictions of the Mortis gods have been found scattered throughout the galaxy, such as the mural at the Jedi Temple on Lothal. However, Baylan’s discovery of the Mortis god statues suggests Mortis may physically reside on Peridea. It’s no understatement to say that the Mortis gods are some of the most important and allegorical characters in all of Star Wars. And if Baylan has found where they once dwelled, he may have stumbled across the power to harness the Force itself.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThe three Mortis gods were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars as immensely powerful beings, known as \"Force-wielders.\" The Father, the Daughter, and the Son served to guide the Force along its path in the galaxy. While these beings had a physical presence on Mortis, they also had the ability to shape-shift at will. According to one of them, their purpose was to guard “the power,” meaning the Force itself. The realm of Mortis acted as a conduit through which all the Force in Star Wars flowed, and the Mortis gods were the ones who controlled that flow while ensuring the duality between the dark side and the light side remained.\nThe Mortis gods were venerated throughout the galaxy as legendary. In Star Wars Rebels, Ezra Bridger found a mural of the Mortis gods on the Jedi Temple of Lothal that led to the entrance of the World Between Worlds; there are also inscriptions of the Mortis gods in some of the sacred Jedi texts used by Rey in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Although the Jedi Order clearly once knew of the Mortis gods, belief in their existence appears to have waned. Even the Father said that few still know of the Mortis gods’ existence. According to him, their unique ability to manipulate the Force compelled them to abandon the temporal world.\nIn The Clone Wars, the Father is portrayed as an aged man who maintains the balance of the Force by keeping his children in check. It’s likely he’s been performing this duty for several thousands of years, given the ancient depictions of him on Lothal and Peridea. He believed the realm of Mortis was the only place he could fully control his children and prevent them from tearing the fabric of the universe apart. However, the Mortis arc also revealed that the Father was dying, and that he was losing his grip on the ability to control his children.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nThe Father was the most powerful Mortis god, and the children derived their power and immortally from him. Mortis acted as both a sanctuary and a prison for the three Force-wielders. While the Father was tempered enough to keep the balance, the Daughter and the Son were too far aligned to either side of the Force to be trusted on their own. In other words, though they desired to flee Mortis and exert their power over the galaxy in full, the Father kept them both shackled out of love. In his eyes, the dark and the light must wax and wane equally. If one side gained too much power, then the balance of life was thrown out of sorts.\nThe Daughter of the Father represented the light side of the Force, and the side that the Jedi tended to favor. She had the ability to transform into an enormous griffin. She was the day, and enjoyed giving life to Mortis by causing plants to bloom in the sun. Unlike her brother, who desired more and more power, the Daughter took her role as the light side in somberness. She believed and trusted her Father’s decision in keeping her and her brother captive, and she only exercised her power when her brother challenged her. In her own words, she constantly wishes to do what is selfless.\nInterestingly, the Daughter’s statue that Baylan finds on Peridea has been decapitated. As the light side of the Force, her absence symbolizes the state of the light side during Ahsoka's place in the Star Wars timeline. In The Clone Wars, the Daughter sacrifices herself to save the Father, and then transfers her remaining life into Ahsoka Tano. In many ways, her death represents Order 66 and the fall of the Jedi Order. Just as she died, so too the Jedi were killed. Meanwhile, the Son was left to gain power on Mortis alone, much like how Palpatine was able to rule the galaxy for a time.\nAs the representation of the dark side of the Force, the Son (voiced by Sam Witwer) continually seeks to usurp the Father and take his place as the most powerful Mortis god. There was a part of him that loved his sister, but it may have been solely because she gave his own power meaning. The Son was adept at shapeshifting into many different forms, his favorite being a giant bat. However, he also took on the guise of Shmi Skywalker, Anakin’s mother, in order to tempt him to the dark side. The Son also transformed into a small goblin in order to taunt Ahsoka and infect her with the dark side.\nWhile the Daughter was selfless, the Son was selfish. Like the Sith who derived their power from him, he delighted in decay, darkness, and the power hatred and malice gave him. After the Daughter died, Mortis became a realm of darkness and despair. The plants she’d grown withered due to the Son’s power. In a last-ditch effort to escape Mortis, the Son revealed Anakin’s future as Darth Vader to him, though these memories were later removed by the Father. Nevertheless, the Son’s victory over the Daughter represented the Empire and the dark side taking over.\nVery little has been revealed about where the realm of Mortis was located in the galaxy. Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Ahsoka were transported there by an octahedral monument floating near the Chrelythium system. While there, Obi-Wan said that his scanners couldn’t place where they were in the known galaxy. Ahsoka seemed to think the planet was barely larger than an asteroid. Nevertheless, Baylan Skoll may have proven that Mortis actually physically reside on Peridea. If this is the case, then Baylan is close to discovering the location of the conduit of the Force. Mortis itself amplifies Force-sensitivity, meaning Baylan could take his place as a Force-wielder or even harness the flow of the Force itself.\nThere are several notable locations on Mortis. The Well of the Dark Side was a fiery chasm that led deep beneath the planet’s surface, and was the place where all the dark side in the galaxy flowed through. Elsewhere, the Altar of Mortis housed the Dagger of Mortis, a weapon more dangerous than any lightsaber given its ability to kill Mortis gods. However, the majority of the action in the Mortis arc takes place in the Mortis monastery, which may be the same structure Baylan sees in the distance on Peridea.\nRelated: Star Wars: The Clone Wars Episodes In Chronological Order (Correct Watch Order)\nThe entire Mortis arc in The Clone Wars was precipitated by the Father to determine whether Anakin was truly the Chosen One. Given his failing health, the Father believed Anakin could remain on Mortis as his successor, though Anakin ultimately rejected this offer. Even with their mystical power, the Mortis gods still held the prophecy of the Chosen One in reverence. The Father says that it was foretold Anakin would remain on Mortis and continue to keep the balance. Nevertheless, Anakin's refusal ultimately led to the destruction of Mortis and the end of the Mortis gods.\nThe Mortis arc was intensely symbolic, making it hard to place in the Star Wars timeline. Though Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka were transported there during the Clone Wars, the days they spent with the Mortis gods did not occur in real time. Upon their return to the temporal galaxy, Captain Rex says that they only lost contact with them for a few moments. In other words, the realm of Mortis may not be bound by time, which would explain how the Father has been able to keep the balance between his children for thousands of years.\nThe Mortis arc takes place in Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, episodes 15, 16, and 17. In “Overlords,” Anakin, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan first arrive at the strange realm of Mortis. Anakin also proved his ability to subdue both the Son and the Daughter simultaneously, solidifying his role as the Chosen One who can control the Force. However, in “Altar of Mortis,” the Daughter was killed while attempting to save the Father from the Son, nullifying Anakin’s need to remain and keep the balance. In “Ghosts of Mortis,” the Father chose to sacrifice himself in order to take away the Son’s power and immortality, allowing Anakin to deal the final blow.\nWhile Mortis itself does not appear, a depiction of the Mortis gods also appears in Star Wars Rebels season 4, episodes 12 and 13. In “Wolves and a Door,” Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren discover a hidden mural of the Father, the Son, and the Daughter deep under the Jedi Temple on Lothal. By using the Force, Ezra was able to activate a gateway leading to the World Between Worlds, which may be intrinsically linked to the power of the Mortis gods. In “A World Between Worlds,” Ezra managed to save Ahsoka using time travel, though the mural and the Temple ultimately collapse in on themselves at the end.\nIn the brief years between The Clone Wars’ release and Disney’s eventual takeover, Aaron Allston further expounded on the mystery of the Mortis gods in his Fate of the Jedi series. Now a part of Star Wars Legends, Allston introduced an ancient being known as Abeloth, who was the primary antagonist of his works. Originally a mortal woman who stumbled across the three Mortis gods, she eventually took her place as the absent Mother in their family. Unlike the Father, who merely contained his children, Abeloth was able to get them to cooperate. However, as a mortal, Abeloth eventually grew old and longed to be immortal.\nRelated: Is Star Wars Bringing Back Legends' Most Powerful Dark Side Being?\nThough they are now a part of Legends, Abeloth drank from Font of Power and swam in the Pool of Knowledge. And while these acts granted her immortality, they also twisted her into a terrifyingly powerful entity of the dark side. The rest of the Mortis gods, fearing her power, had her imprisoned. However, their deaths in The Clone Wars ultimately freed Abeloth to wreak havoc on the galaxy. Furthermore, it’s possible that Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni means to bring Abeloth to canon; she could be the entity drawing Baylan to Mortis.\nIf Abeloth is not calling to Baylan, then it may be that the Mortis gods are not as dead as The Clone Wars led the audience to believe. Since the Mortis gods are heavily tied to the Force itself, its possible they persist even after their physical forms perished. The Father even tells Anakin that their physicality was merely a reflection of the surrounding energy. If the Mortis gods still exist within the Force, it could be that they’re calling to Baylan to come to Mortis and take their place as the keepers of the power.\nRegardless of whether it’s the Mortis gods or Abeloth who call to Baylan, Dave Filoni faces a difficult decision in wrapping up Baylan’s Mortis plot line. With the unfortunate passing of Ray Stevenson, Baylan’s character remains stuck atop the statue of the Father. His goal of reaching Mortis is in sight, yet he can no longer reach it. Regardless of how Filoni handles the loss, he’s managed to use the Mortis gods to tie together almost every Star Wars project he’s worked on, from The Clone Wars, to Rebels, and now Ahsoka.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka now streaming on Disney+.\n"}
