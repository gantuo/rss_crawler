This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- DoolittleHouston AstrosNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champsALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield Ready for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000.

If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- DoolittleMinnesota TwinsNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champsALDS opponent: Astros (46.7% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 10.5% | Caesars odds: +2000Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins stay healthy enough? Everything went Minnesota's way in the opening round, but health remains a question. Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis. Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- GonzalezEditor's PicksPassan: Why all 12 MLB playoff teams can win the World Series -- and which one actually will3dJeff PassanOctober ace tiers: Ranking the top 15 starting pitchers for the 2023 MLB playoffs5dKiley McDanielAn A+ for the O's ... and SIX F's!? Full regular-season grades for all 30 MLB teams8dDavid Schoenfield2 RelatedWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- DoolittleTexas RangersNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild cardALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- SchoenfieldHow the Rangers got to OctoberAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »Passan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- DoolittleNational LeagueAtlanta BravesNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champsNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- SchoenfieldThe year of the HR-crushing BravesCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.MLB execs on how to beat Atlanta » Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- SchoenfieldWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- DoolittleLos Angeles DodgersNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champsNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 23The one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- GonzalezL.A.'s dominant transition yearCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs. Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs » 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- DoolittlePhiladelphia PhilliesNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild cardNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- GonzalezEarly MLB free agency rankingsNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason. Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- DoolittleArizona DiamondbacksNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild cardNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- SchoenfieldHow the D-backs learned to contendWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »Passan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle\n\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers (50.2% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista.

Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\n\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\n\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}

(1:06)\nSAN DIEGO -- The Los Angeles Lakers might have the Nuggets on their minds this week, but Denver coach Michael Malone said the defending NBA champions have nothing but respect for the Lakers and have turned the page from the Western Conference finals sweep of Los Angeles.\nMalone was asked Wednesday about how some of the Lakers talked about his team this week and how they have been motivated by trash talk from Malone and the Nuggets all summer.\n\"Oh, they're talking about us? That was what, four months ago?\" Malone said after practice at the Nuggets' training camp at UC San Diego. \"I can't speak for anybody in L.A., but if they're still worried about us, that's on them.\n\"This is a new season, a new challenge, and it was a hell of a series against them. I know it was a 4-0 sweep, but all those games seemed like they went down to the wire. We have tremendous respect for that team.

But me and [LeBron James] had some conversations like, 'We can't wait [to play them again].'\"\nDuring the Western Conference finals, Malone said the narrative was much more about the Lakers than the Nuggets. After the sweep, Malone was asked whether he believed the Nuggets would be overshadowed by their Finals opponent, the Miami Heat, much like he felt about the national chatter being focused on the Lakers during the conference finals.\n\"If anybody is still talking about the Lakers in the NBA Finals, that's on them.

That's why everybody was talking about it.\"\nJames posted on his Instagram in June, without acknowledging Malone -- his former assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers -- by name: \"I hear I'm on your mind that much, huh??? I mean I guess I see why ...

Left-hander Yusei Kikuchi, one of four Blue Jays who made 31 or more starts this season, was greeted by a single from Max Kepler.

Inter Miami is 1-3-2 in its six matches without Messi since he joined the club.\n\"Barcelona missed him, and the Argentine team missed him,\" Miami coach Gerardo Martino said about Messi. \"Of course we're going to miss the best player in the world.\"\nMiami has three games left to play, including a game in hand over the two teams it is chasing for the final playoff spot in Chicago and Montreal.\nThe Argentina World Cup winner has played just once since coming back from international duty in September with the recurrence of a leg injury; he started but then came off in the first half of a 4-0 win over Toronto FC.\nMessi did not make the trip to Chicago with the team. He has now missed five of Miami's past six matches and was seen training independently from the rest of the team earlier in the week. He has been described as game-to-game by Martino in recent weeks.\nThe Fire sold a team-record 61,000 tickets to the match at Soldier Field.\nAfter Messi's presence became unlikely, the club announced an offer to fans attending the match: a $250 account credit \"toward new memberships for the 2024 season or a $50 account credit to all single-game ticket buyers who attend our match vs. Inter Miami regardless of which players are able to make an appearance on the pitch.\"\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this story."}

Malnati was surprised by the move, stating that the tour doesn't need to \"resort to gimmicks,\" but he quickly had a change of heart.\n\"I shouldn't have said that,\" Malnati said. \"I don't know that having Lexi play is a gimmick, but I don't think the tournaments are going to have to go to those kind of lengths to drum up interest and get storylines that they can sell because I think these events are actually going to have a lot of meaning.\n\"Like I said, change is hard for everyone at every level, so I assume if you're a host organization of a tournament ... you just don't know right now for sure what you have anymore because the fall is completely reimagined.\"\nAt the very least, Malnati said he believes Thompson's entry into the 132-woman field will catch people's eye.\n\"Having Lexi play certainly will get a lot of headlines, and if that's the goal for Shriners and the host organization in Vegas there, that's great,\" Malnati said. \"Obviously, she's a professional athlete. She's accomplished a lot.\"\nMalnati, 36, stuck to his steadfast opinion back in June, when he made comments regarding a lack of trust that players have in the tour following its framework agreement with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. He noted that it would take time for the relationship between the two sides to be fixed.\nMalnati will be playing in this week's Sanderson Farms Championship in Jackson, Mississippi. He last appeared in the Fortinet Championship, finishing tied for 11th on Sept. 17."}

He had successful surgery Sept. 15 to remove the tumor, located between his cerebellum and brainstem, but his speech and ability to communicate have been impacted, according to Dr. Catherine O'Neal of Our Lady of the Lake Health.\nO'Neal said there is no evidence Brooks' cancer has spread.\n\"Although he is responsive and working daily with physical therapy, he will face months of intensive rehabilitation,\" O'Neal said in a statement. \"The surgery was successful in removing the tumor, and there is no evidence that the cancer has spread. As he begins rehab in the coming weeks, Greg's family and care team will determine a treatment plan in collaboration with nationally recognized specialists in this specific form of brain cancer.

{"title": "MLB Wild Card Series: Analysis and takeaways from a FOUR-sweep day!", "date": "2023-10-05 13:35:49", "text": "Well, that was fast!\nOn the second day of Wild Card week, all four series were decided: The Texas Rangers kicked off the day by eliminating the Tampa Bay Rays with a dominant 7-1 win, and the Minnesota Twins won their first playoff series since 2002 by sweeping the Toronto Blue Jays.The Arizona Diamondbacks knocked off the NL Central-winning Milwaukee Brewers, and the Philadelphia Phillies dominated the Miami Marlins in front of a raucous home crowd.\nWe've got you covered with our takeaways on each series -- and what's next for the four teams eliminated Wednesday.\nKey links: Day 1 | Everything you need to know | Bracket | Picks | Watch on ESPN, ABC\n\nTwins 2, Blue Jays 0: Sometimes the analysis is simple: The Twins pitched well, the Blue Jays didn't hit well -- and the Twins swept two low-scoring games for their first postseason series win since 2002. Give credit to a Minnesota pitching staff that has ability to make a deep postseason run. Pablo Lopez and Sonny Gray were both excellent in their starts and match up favorably with any team's top two starters. The bullpen has several guys who can pump it up into the upper 90s. That relief corps has the ability to be dominant this October (although manager Rocco Baldelli's insistence on using Louie Varland in high-leverage situations may bite him at some point). The question is whether the Twins can score enough runs -- but don't discount their chances of knocking off the Astros in the ALDS. As for the Jays, they remain without a postseason win in the Vladimir Guerrero Jr./Bo Bichette era, and you have to wonder whether the team needs a major offensive overhaul in the offseason. -- David Schoenfield\n\nRangers 7, Rays 1: Give the Rangers credit: They lost that last series of the season in Seattle, costing them the AL West title, and then had to fly cross-country to play a tough Rays team that had the best home record in the AL. We saw the best version of the Rangers, especially with Jordan Montgomery and Nathan Eovaldi combining to allow just one run in 17⅔ innings. We saw a lineup that has power up and down the lineup -- including rookie Evan Carter, who is having an October breakout.\nWhat we didn't learn: Can the bullpen close out a tight game? The starters went deep and the games weren't close. And manager Bruce Bochy's decision to bat Robbie Grossman third against right-handed starters, with some other good hitters to choose from, remains more than a little questionable given Grossman has hit .182 with a .569 OPS against righties the past two seasons. We'll see if that continues in Baltimore. -- Schoenfield\n\nArizona 5, Brewers 2: What we witnessed during a very brief NL wild card round in Milwaukee might well have been a young, talented team embarking on a new chapter in its history. Arizona's sweep was impressive -- not because its flashy athleticism was on full blast but because the team showed the big stage was not too big. It's a cliched observation to be sure, but it fits.\nThe Diamondbacks displayed professional, disciplined at-bats in both games. The quality of their at-bats improved as the games progressed, and they got to Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta the second time through the order. They did it with power, too, always a good formula for postseason winning.\nThe Arizona bullpen was impressive in the two games, with manager Torey Lovullo showing no compunction about trotting out a parade of guys you've probably never heard of. But Kevin Ginkel, Joe Mantiply, Miguel Castro and others have all gotten rolling late in the season -- and when a bullpen gathers steam in the playoffs, anything can happen.\nTo be sure, it's a gut-punch loss for Milwaukee, which squandered numerous scoring chances with multiple runners on base and so come away from a 94-win season with little to show for it. But credit for that perhaps goes to Arizona too, which did an outstanding job managing situations. If the D-Backs keep that up over the next week, this matchup against the heavily favored Dodgers might be an awful lot of fun. -- Bradford Doolittle\n\nPhillies 7, Marlins 1: The Phillies dominated in all phases of the game in their sweep of the Marlins. In Game 2, Aaron Nola cruised through seven scoreless innings and the offense ripped out six extra-base hits, including a 110-mph home run from J.T. Realmuto and a Bryson Stott grand slam to break the game open. Can we read too much into these two games? Not really, as the Marlins had the weakest offense of any of the playoff times. Still, the Phillies certainly look like the team that rolled through the NL side of the bracket last season -- except this team is a little deeper, better defensively and still has that raucous home crowd behind them. This sets up what could be the most exciting series of the postseason: Phillies versus Braves. The Braves won the season series 8 to 5, including four out of seven in September. You can throw that out the window. It's 0-0 now. -- Schoenfield"}
{"title": "Untold stories of the Air Raid revolution, from pregame hot dogs to Phil Collins photo ops", "date": "2023-10-05 12:16:40", "text": "Long before the world knew Mike Leach or Dana Holgorsen or any of the other oddballs, eccentrics and revolutionaries of the Air Raid fraternity, Hal Mumme was a high school coach in Copperas Cove, Texas, with a problem.\nIt was 1986, the NBA and a young superstar had captured the attention of the school's best athletes. Even Mumme's own son came home from school one day and announced he wanted to be Michael Jordan.\nThis was Texas, and most coaches still romanticized the notion that football had to be torture for it to be worthwhile. There was a machismo to the running game, ramming head-on into each other and surviving battles of attrition, with defenses built around big, physical players meant to win those battles.\n\"My generation's football coaches fought World War II,\" Mumme said, \"and they were pretty damn determined to make us relive it every day in practice.\"\nSo Mumme, who had already gone from being the nation's youngest coordinator at UTEP at 27, was now 31, looking to reboot his career after the Miners' whole staff had been fired, and he had a wild idea. What if he made football fun? What if he actually used the entire field?\nAnd so the beginnings of the Air Raid were born, 67 miles away from Austin, where just 10 years before, Texas coach Darrell Royal was running the wishbone and repeating his maxim: \"Three things can happen to you whenever you throw the football, and two of 'em are bad.\" But Mumme, who idolized Royal, realized that the same thing that made the wishbone work, spreading the ball in space to skilled athletes, might work even better as a passing offense. So he went all-in.\nA decade later, Mumme burst onto the national scene at Kentucky, walking around on SEC fields, eating hot dogs, wearing flip-flops and listening to Jimmy Buffet before becoming the only UK coach in the past 100 years to beat Alabama. His creation made 5-9 slot receivers superstars and walk-on quarterbacks Heisman winners. Mumme made it possible for Mike Leach, a lawyer from Pepperdine, to become a college football icon, for Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech walk-on himself from tiny Muleshoe, Texas, to lead two of the most storied programs in history. He made football interesting for unpedigreed coaches who loved the sport, but who would rather write books about Geronimo than sleep in their offices or run the damn ball.\n\"The Air Raid is not an offense,\" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"The Air Raid is a way of life.\"\n\"It's a mentality,\" Riley said, \"more than a collection of plays.\"\nThese mavericks changed the course of football history and rewrote record books, paving the way for Patrick Mahomes to win two Super Bowls while forcing Bill Belichick and Nick Saban to give into wide-open passing attacks. How they did it was never boring.\nLast year, Dykes, a former Mumme assistant at Kentucky, made a historic run to the national title game after a 5-7 season. This year Deion Sanders, who used to pick Mumme's brain and called Leach for offensive staff recommendations, is using the same wide-open principles at Colorado during its program jump-start, turning his own son, Shedeur, into a Heisman candidate at QB.\nWith the sport still mourning Leach, the most famous and revered coach in the extended Air Raid family, following his death in December, we set out to find tales from the rise of the game-changing offense that illustrate the methods behind their collective madness.\nFor every Tim Couch or Kyler Murray or Caleb Williams, the bluest of blue-chip prospects, there are dozens of record-setting Air Raid quarterbacks who were unwanted by anyone else, then ran up the gaudiest of numbers.\nDustin Dewald blazed the trail in Copperas Cove. He was one of those players who got disillusioned with the drudgery of football in the 1980s, so he quit to join the golf team after watching his older brother get pummeled over and over as their QB.\n\"We got our heads kicked in trying to run the ball down the throats of bigger, more powerful teams, lining up in the Power I with an offensive line that averaged 195 pounds,\" Dewald said. \"It was just ridiculous. Hal came in and said, 'All that's going to change.' It did. I think it was the first time in 10 years we didn't have a losing season in Cove.\"\nBetween 1978 and 1985, Cove went 10-69, including two 0-10 seasons. In Mumme's first year in 1986, the Bulldogs went 5-5. They were still outmanned, but Mumme, who began by using the run and shoot, gave them a shot in every game. Then against district rival Georgetown, the opposing coach, Art Briles, blitzed Mumme relentlessly, making it difficult for more complex plays to develop.\n\"I decided I was never going to let that happen to me again,\" Mumme said, reducing his offense to a collection of short passes and horizontal crossing routes.\nDewald threw the ball more than all but a handful of schools in Texas that year. There had been only two scholarship players in the previous 10 years at Cove, but he signed with Stephen F. Austin. Then, he went through the same cycle, quitting due to boredom and joining the golf team at Tarleton State. There weren't any college teams he knew of where he could replicate his experience. Until he went home to Cove to visit.\nHe stopped by the football offices to congratulate Mumme on his new job he'd just landed at a small college, Iowa Wesleyan. By the time he left, Mumme had once again recruited him to play quarterback for a team that was similar to Sanders' Colorado experiment: IWU was coming off an 0-10 season and had just two players returning.\n\"We tried to have a team meeting after I got introduced at the press conference and they told me there were going to be 40 guys,\" Mumme said. \"I walk in, there's two, and the three that I brought with me. I just gave 'em the same speech I was going to give 'em anyway about working hard in the offseason, and we're going to win games. One kid just got up and walked out. I guess he decided, 'This is bulls---, I'm not doing this.' So we had four.\"\nLeach was one of only two applicants for Mumme's offensive coordinator job, and they quickly realized they were kindred spirits. It was a leap of faith: The high school coach took a $20,000 pay cut to try to prove himself in college again. The lawyer who could've made $200,000 a year instead was making $12,000, and the golfer took on student-loan debt to go to school in Iowa -- where none of them had ever been.\nThey went 7-4 the next year, then, by 1991, started tinkering and added the up-tempo element where they never huddled and ran plays at a frenetic pace. Opposing teams had never seen anything like it and had no idea how to stop it. In Dewald's accidental career, he threw for 12,045 yards, 115 TDs and set 25 NAIA records. He threw for 4,418 yards and 45 TDs in 1991, including one game where he set national records with 86 attempts and 61 completions. Leach sent out press releases to national media, coining the name \"Air Raid\" in the process and building the mystique.\nWhile it may have appeared the gaudy numbers were because of an intricate playbook, it was actually the opposite. There was no playbook at all. The philosophy was making things as barebones as possible.\nDon't practice plays you won't call in a game. Don't call plays in a game you don't practice. Don't throw to a covered receiver and don't pass up an open one.\nThe plays came from LaVell Edwards at BYU, with Mumme saying he's watched every offensive snap of Edwards' career. He picked his favorites -- four passing and two rushing -- that seemed to always work. His practice drills, the real backbone of the Air Raid, according to the coaches, were all about details of that limited set, and were all based on Bill Walsh's 49ers practices.\nSo he made every practice consistent and repetitive and drilled until they were mind-numbingly boring. Do it until you can't screw it up, and let muscle memory win. And if it works, keep doing it. Mumme said he once called the same play 52 times in a game for Dewald.\nDecades after helping launch the revolution, Dewald has watched teammates like Bill Bedenbaugh, an Iowa Wesleyan offensive linemen who's now considered one of the best O-line coaches in the country at Oklahoma, along with Holgorsen, his old IWU wide receiver who's become another of the sport's most idiosyncratic coaches, and he finds it amusing that he still understands almost everything they do.\n\"For years, I would go visit [Leach or Mumme] every year for at least one home game and spend days with them at practice and on the sidelines of games,\" Dewald said. \"The last time I visited Mike at Washington State, I looked at the script for the game and it was crazy. I actually knew what to do on 90 percent of it -- and it was almost 30 years after I stopped playing. Just to see what they've all accomplished has been mind-blowing for me, how much it's changed the game and how successful they've all been has been, really, cool to watch.\"\nChris Hatcher is convinced Mumme isn't the inventor of the Air Raid. He claims the title.\nHatcher signed at Valdosta State to play for Mike Cavan, a former Georgia assistant who had coached under Vince Dooley and was Herschel Walker's lead recruiter. They were an I-formation team with a few passing concepts.\nMumme arrived at Valdosta after Cavan left for another job and, armed with talent he'd never had before, he initially made the same mistake he criticized other coaches for: He overcomplicated things.\n\"I don't care what anybody says, I'm the guy that invented the Air Raid,\" Hatcher said. \"I was not smart enough to comprehend all this stuff Hal wanted to do. So we had to dummy it way down for me. And then that's when the Air Raid took off. That is the truth.\"\nHatcher learned to appreciate the beauty of perfecting and running an offense so simple that he had a little extra time on his hands, enough to visit a frat party the night before homecoming and leave with a parting gift.\n\"You didn't have to be in the film room all night because it didn't matter what the defense was doing,\" Hatcher said. \"We were so good at it that you had time to go out and steal a cannon in the evening. It was a legit Civil War cannon, now, too. Let's not act like it was a little peashooter.\"\nHatcher threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns and set 29 school records. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals, and when it was all said and done set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. He won the 1994 Harlon Hill Award, often called the D-II Heisman, as the Blazers went 40-17-1 in his career.\nThis captured the attention of Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton, who wanted to match the basketball program pace. He handpicked Mumme, which raised eyebrows among purists who believed such a gimmick offense wouldn't work in the big, bad SEC. But Kentucky already had a homegrown star quarterback in Tim Couch, albeit one who was last seen losing 65-0 in his first start to Florida -- and defensive coordinator Bob Stoops -- and attempted just 84 passes over seven games.\nFirst, Mumme enlisted Hatcher, now a graduate assistant, to convince Couch not to transfer. (They went to Hooters and talked it out.) He stuck around, working with Hatcher, who was in charge of getting Mumme's play scripts prepared for Couch's wristband. Mumme would say Play 1 or Play 2, and Couch would call what's on the wristband. Quarterbacks often would check into different plays freely, but in one game, Couch took it to an extreme.\n\"We get about three or four first downs and Couch ain't run a play Mumme's called yet,\" Hatcher said. \"We go down and score, and the whole time Mumme is on the headsets using a few choice words to me.\"\nMumme accused Hatcher, who often changed the play himself when playing for Mumme, of purposely telling Couch not to run Mumme's calls.\n\"I can't believe you'd do this to me,\" Mumme said, according to Hatcher. \"Then it finally hit me. Couch was using the wristband from the week before, and didn't change it out. Every play was wrong, and we went down and scored anyway. My point is, when you rep the plays so much, we feel like it doesn't matter. I can pick me a handful of plays that should work against just about anything you'll see. I like to say we're a well-coached backyard football team.\"\nCouch's mastery paid off in 1997 when he threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Craig Yeast in overtime to lead Kentucky to a win over Alabama 40-34. It was Kentucky's first win over Alabama in 75 years -- something the Wildcats haven't done since. It came just a year after Couch threw for 13 yards (UK had 67 total yards) in an entire game against Stoops' Florida defense under Steve Spurrier. Couch threw for 348 and 406 yards in the next two meetings. While the Gators ended up pulling away and winning both games handily, it was frustrating for Stoops, and their mentality impressed him.\n\"I liked how [Leach] and Hal Mumme were over there standing together,\" Stoops said. \"I took note of the casual nature of the two of them. But they were the most difficult to deal with.\"\nNothing Mumme did was by accident. He doesn't dispute any contentions that he and Leach were arrogant.\n\"There's no question,\" Mumme said. \"We always thought we were smarter than everybody else. We always thought we had better ideas than everybody else. And we pretty much did. That's why everybody's trying to do it now.\"\nMumme could be combative with reporters, and Leach could be aloof. And they weren't worried about too many other opinions.\n\"We played Jimmy Buffett during warmups,\" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown, who played wide receiver at Kentucky under Mumme. \"I don't know if that gets it going for you.\"\n\"It got me and Mike going,\" Mumme said, laughing. \"We weren't worried about anybody else.\"\nThey loved causing a stir or annoying other fans, like when Leach mocked Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets as head coach at rival Texas Tech.\n\"How come they get to pretend they are soldiers?\" Leach said. \"The thing is, they aren't actually in the military. I ought to have Mike's Pirate School. The freshmen, all they get is the bandanna. When you're a senior, you get the sword and skull and crossbones. For homework, we'll work pirate maneuvers and stuff like that.\"\nThe Aggies were not amused.\nThen again, Leach and Mumme were, which was the point. Jeff Allen can testify.\nBefore Allen became the only staff member that's been with Nick Saban for his entire Alabama tenure, a trusted confidante and sports medicine guru, he was an assistant trainer at Kentucky -- but most importantly, he was Mumme's hot dog guy.\nUK was about to play at LSU in Death Valley, then coached by embattled coach Gerry DiNardo. Mumme marched into the training room on Wednesday with a request that befuddled Allen.\n\"Hey, during pregame, when I'm talking to DiNardo, I want you to bring me a hot dog,\" Mumme said.\nAllen didn't understand. He'd been with him for more than five years at this point, and this was a new one.\n\"Finally, over the next day or two, I said, 'Why do you want a hot dog while you're on the field talking to their head coach?\" Allen said, \"He said, 'Because they're going to be so uptight to begin with. I want to show 'em how carefree and how relaxed I am, and it's going to make them even more nervous.'\"\nMumme was very specific that he wanted mustard on it. He sent a student for the hot dog and was on the field during pregame when he saw Mumme, who he hadn't talked to yet on the day of the game. He thought, \"well here goes nothing,\" and headed over.\n\"I looked at him and said, 'Coach, here's your hot dog,' Allen said. \"He looked at me and goes, 'Oh, thanks Jeff.' Then he said, 'Hey, hold on, hold on. Does it have mustard on it?'\" Allen assured him it did, all the while playing it straight.\n\"I can still see DiNardo's face,\" Allen said. \"He was like, 'What in the world is happening here?' And I swear to you, Hal just stood there talking and eating that hot dog. I walked off and I turned around and I wanted to see it again. And there they are talking and Hal is just chomping on a hotdog right there on the 50-yard line of Tiger Stadium. And our players were seeing it. They were laughing. They were dying during warmups watching it.\"\nThe Wildcats were 0-24 on the road against ranked teams since 1977. They were 9½-point underdogs. They played fast and loose and kicked a walk-off field goal to win at the buzzer 39-36, sealing one of the biggest wins in school history. It led Kentucky to a bid in the Outback Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl for the Wildcats since 1952.\n\"I'm not saying we won that game because of the hot dog,\" Allen said. \"But I don't think it hurt.\"\nOn Dec. 1, 1998, Oklahoma hired Stoops. The Sooners hadn't had a winning season in six years and were coming off a 12-22 stretch in three years under John Blake. Stoops, then 38, was a hot commodity as a defensive coordinator. Hiring someone to run his offense was his first big decision.\n\"My initial talks were with Turner Gill, who was at Nebraska at the time,\" Stoops said. \"That didn't really work out. And then I got to thinking. ... I didn't know [Leach], but the more I thought about it, the more I referred back to how challenging it was to handle Kentucky. If they can be that good at Kentucky, why couldn't we be as good or better at Oklahoma? So I went with it.\"\nIt was a bold move. Leach had never been a playcaller, and let's face it, he was pretty weird.\n\"I thought Mike was really interesting,\" Stoops said. \"Mike had a little different way of doing things. But let me tell you something: He was a hell of a leader. He was demanding, as aloof as he might be. He wanted things done a certain way and they damn sure better be done that way or you were going to hear it. He might look laid back, he was demanding, very demanding.\"\nThat was a learning curve for the rest of the staff, who couldn't figure out if this was all an act, or if Leach was for real.\n\"It was completely different from anything that any of us had seen in the offensive meeting room,\" former Oklahoma assistant and Kansas head coach Mark Mangino said. \"It did take time to get used to.\"\nSo did Leach's personality. The staff was all staying at a hotel in Norman, and somehow Mangino's room became the center of the action.\n\"I couldn't get him out of my room when I was living in the Residence Inn,\" Mangino said. \"Every night, somebody delivered a couple cases of beer, a box of cigars, and we sat around and called recruits till about 11:30.\"\nBy midnight, everyone was gone. Except Leach.\n\"Mike used to like to watch those simulcasts of Howard Stern. And those things would run till 4 in the morning. I'm in my bed trying to sleep. And here's Leach at 3 in the morning, he's laughing at Howard Stern, he's drinking a beer and he's having a good time.\"\nStoops, too, had a learning curve.\n\"I learned after the first few weeks late at night not to stop in and check in on Mike,\" Stoops said. \"One night, it's 11 or something, I'm ready to go home, and he starts telling me a story about Geronimo. After about 20 minutes, I said, 'Mike, I'm going home. I'm the head coach, I get to go when I want.'\"\nMangino, meanwhile, couldn't shake him at night, and he couldn't get through to him by day. In a staff meeting, Mangino suggested a running play. Leach couldn't have been less interested. Mangino suggested trying it at practice, and Leach blew him off again. Mangino said maybe he'll practice it anyway.\n\"Mike said, you could put it in all you want, you could run it during every play of inside drill, but I'm never going to call it in a game,\" and Mangino and Leach nearly came to blows, Stoops said, laughing.\nAn irritated Stoops called them into his office and made them hash it out. Stoops made it clear that he had given Leach full control, and they'd do it his way. Leach and Mangino became good friends.\nThe Big 12 was never the same. The new-look Sooners went 7-5 and made their first bowl game in five years. Texas Tech hired Leach, and Mangino took over, finally getting to put in a couple of wrinkles of his own.\nMangino had a season's worth of reps in place, and he said he ran about 80% of Leach's offense. \"And it worked,\" he said. The Sooners won a national championship, going 13-0 behind Josh Heupel, a lightly recruited junior college quarterback Leach found at Snow College.\nFrom the @kfor archives, Mike Leach at his last OU practice with Josh Heupel on Dec. 8, 1999. You can see the emotions as he talks with Heupel. Leach was introduced as the Texas Tech head coach the next day. pic.twitter.com/xm65rAhAes\n\"They were the ones that invented it ... but we [Oklahoma, Leach, Texas Tech and the Big 12] were the ones to make it popular,\" Stoops said. \"They weren't getting the national attention at Kentucky until we started it. And then, of course, we kept it and won the national championship.\"\nLeach became a star at Texas Tech. He took down No. 1 Texas, guided the Red Raiders to a bowl game in all 10 of his seasons and finished as the program's all-time winningest coach at 84-43.\nDykes was part of Leach's first staff that replaced his dad, Spike Dykes, who had retired.\n\"We were doing all this stuff that was really analytics, but they didn't know it was,\" Dykes said. \"We were going for it all the time on fourth down or going for it in our own territory. My dad would be like, 'What the hell are you doing?' I'm like, 'It gives us a chance to beat Texas. Instead of losing by 14, we might lose by 50. But we also might win?'\"\nIt became one of the most influential eras in college football. In Mumme's days in Kentucky, Urban Meyer and Sean Payton were among the earliest coaches to visit to try to learn what the Air Raid is all about. In Lubbock, Leach made sure his doors were wide open, and there were visitors everywhere.\nLeach made sure his coaches knew that he wanted them to teach visitors anything they wanted to know.\nThere was only one issue: \"They didn't believe us,\" said Lincoln Riley, who was a student assistant for Leach, because the entire offense was so simple.\n\"I've never been to a place where you had more coaches around constantly,\" Riley said. \"Mike was so open to people coming in. You think just Texas high school coaches? No. I'm talking professional coaches, college coaches from all around the country, high school coaches from all around the country, every single year. There's a group from Japan that came, groups from England that came over, I mean, you name it, we had 'em.\"\nDykes and Holgorsen, who were receivers coaches and later co-offensive coordinators, would handle a lot of high school coaches on their visits. Dykes said he can remember walking out to the parking lot one day and overhearing the coaches leaving convinced the offense couldn't be that simple, that Leach & Co. were holding things back.\n\"'Those sumb------ wouldn't tell us anything,'\" Dykes recalled them saying. \"And we told them everything.\"\nMuleshoe High's David Wood coached Riley and his brother Garrett Riley, now the offensive coordinator at Clemson, and watched as they passed over small-school offers to head to Lubbock to learn from Leach. Over time, he said, you could see the Tech influence take hold and spread throughout high school football, with Muleshoe being one of the early adopters, because Lincoln returned to help him install it while he was still a walk-on quarterback at Tech.\n\"We were a run offense, but once we realized how simple it was, we didn't think it was going to be that hard to switch,\" Wood said. \"We used to run maybe 30 plays in practice because you analyze every play and tell every player what they did wrong and then you'd run the play again and make sure everyone did it right. The way Leach did it, when we watched it, you got to coach on the run. So we were able to get like 120 plays a practice instead of 30 plays a practice.\"\nWood said when Riley set out for Lubbock in 2002, there were maybe two schools in the Texas Panhandle that were running a spread offense.\n\"I would say probably 70 percent of the teams we played when I retired [in 2017] were running it,\" he said. \"Maybe 80.\"\nThe Big 12 became known for its shootouts, and Leach's earliest quarterback rooms were filled with future stars and coaches, all of whom waited their turn, many of them just to start for one season. Kliff Kingsbury, who had originally signed with Spike Dykes, threw for more than 5,000 yards as a senior in 2002 and set seven NCAA records in his three years as a starter at Tech. His backup, B.J. Symons, set the NCAA passing record with 5,833 yards in 2003, and Symons' backups, Sonny Cumbie and Cody Hodges, each passed for more than 4,000 yards in a season as starters.\nThey did it all because Leach repeated the same things he and Mumme had always preached, particularly in the film room.\n\"The worst coaching point he would ever give us, and the one that we all hated, was: 'This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy wasn't open. And he's the one guy you threw it to!\" said Cumbie, now the head coach at Louisiana Tech, imitating Leach's monotone cadence. \"I don't care if it's two-high [safety coverage], one-high. Is it man? Is it zone? Is this guy open? Yes. Throw it to him.\"\nMumme's Kentucky era ended in an NCAA investigation, with Mumme resigning in 2001 amid findings that an assistant coach was sending money orders to players in Memphis. Mumme was cited for a \"failure to monitor,\" but was not punished by the NCAA.\nSince then, he'll sign up to coach anything, anytime, anywhere, including stops at New Mexico State, reviving football after 20 years at Southeastern Louisiana or stops at Division III schools Belhaven in Mississippi and McMurry in Texas.\n\"I'm the Johnny Appleseed of football,\" Mumme said. \"I always thought that was a great story. It's not that I set out to do that -- I never set out to get kicked out of Kentucky -- but when you look back on it, providence had a plan. We spread it a whole lot of places it wouldn't have been otherwise.\"\nAnd despite his offense being almost the norm now, rather than catching teams by surprise, it still works as it was intended: As a sort of money ball, beating teams that you have no business beating.\nAt McMurry, he took over a program that had three winless seasons in the previous decade, including an 0-10 mark the year before he arrived. Three years later, they were 9-3 and 7-1 in the conference.\nOut of the spotlight, Mumme still made history. And he did it in the most Mumme way possible.\nMcMurry opened the 2011 season with an 82-6 loss to Stephen F. Austin, who was ranked in the FCS at the time. After getting down early, Mumme would just keep going for it on fourth down over and over. He was down 35-0 at halftime, and it only got worse from there. But he wouldn't stop.\n\"Losing by 50 was the same as losing by 1,\" Dykes said. \"Hal never cared.\"\nThe next week, Mumme gave the team four days off. He showed them five plays from the first half where it easily could've been 35-28 instead of 35-0. They were set to face UTSA the next week, a D-I team coached by Larry Coker, who'd won a national championship at Miami. Mumme's quarterback, Jake Mullin, like Dewald, wasn't on the team when he arrived. He played baseball, but was a quarterback on the intramural team when Mumme found him.\n\"They said they created this offense for teams without much talent, which was great for us,\" Mullin said, who, like Dewald, ended up throwing for more than 12,000 yards in his career. \"Whenever [Mumme] got there, there was not much there. I mean, I remember I was bigger than my left guard.\"\nMumme took the team to the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, his favorite place, where Teddy Roosevelt recruited Texans at the bar to serve in his Rough Riders. He took the team on a tour of the Alamo the night before the game. The next day, McMurry upset UTSA 24-21 in front of 31,000 fans in the Alamodome, one of the only upsets of a D-I team by a D-III team in history, and Mullin threw for 372 yards.\n\"The Menger's filled with ghosts, we did have a ghost sighting in there,\" Mumme said. \"Between the Menger ghosts and the Alamo ghosts, they probably helped us out.\"\nMumme's fascination with history earned him an invitation from then-McMurry professor Don Frazier to a party for his new book, \"The Alamo and Beyond.\" Also invited? One of the world's largest collectors of Alamo memorabilia in the world: Phil Collins. Yes, that Phil Collins.\nFrazier didn't want Collins to be constantly accosted at the event, so he invited Mumme because he said half the table of Texans would rather talk to Mumme about the Air Raid and Leach than to a British rock star. Even about the Alamo.\nMumme got his copy autographed by Collins. The inscription reads:\n\"To coach... Something's in the air tonight. Cheers. Phil Collins.\"\nMumme, 71, keeps spreading the gospel. He is part of the operations group of a new spring league called the International Football Alliance with teams in Mexico and Texas, and will coach one of the teams. His son, Matt, who never became Michael Jordan, instead stuck with the family business and is now the assistant head coach at Colorado State.\nMumme has seen his little creation change the sport, including watching some of the most storied running teams of his lifetime at USC and Oklahoma be completely transformed. Now, it's finally broken through to the final frontier: the Big Ten, where Wisconsin, under Leach acolyte Phil Longo, is following the same formula as Oklahoma: Join forces with a defensive head coach (Luke Fickell) and flip the offense. Harrell, the former Leach quarterback, is the new offensive coordinator at Purdue as well.\n\"A couple of days before Mike passed, we talked and he was just ultra excited that we're bringing the Air Raid to the Big Ten,\" Longo said. \"It's the most excited I've ever heard him. So it meant something to me that he was happy that we were making moves, and he's the only one who didn't seem shocked by it.\"\nMason Miller, Leach's offensive line coach at Mississippi State who is now the offensive coordinator at Tarleton State, has worked for either Mumme or Leach basically since 1994 when he played running back at Valdosta State. He said the Air Raid family has become so big that it has its share of \"little sibling rivalries,\" but that when they all get together, \"we're like magnets to each other.\"\nLeach's loss has been profound on the family. But out of that loss, there's a new beginning.\nLeach's son Cody spent two years as a volunteer coach at BYU under Kalani Sitake, and spent his dad's final year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State. Now, he's an assistant special teams coach for the Bulldogs, who has completed his Air Raid certification -- a service Mumme offers to keep spreading the word to coaches anywhere -- and is studying his dad's old game tapes stored in Gatorade coolers in his garage.\n\"I wish I could have gotten more time with him,\" Cody, 27, said. \"But Dad being so famous, being on TV, the occasional 'Friday Night Lights' cameo and other random stuff in media, I can always find him. Not everyone has that kind of opportunity where your parent is so well-documented that you can just find them and pull them up anytime.\"\nThere's another Mumme-Leach pairing in the works, with Cody hoping to follow his father's path.\n\"He knew so many other amazing coaches and all the guys he knows, I've known for a long time too,\" Cody said. \"So I have plenty of people to be able to talk to. His was the first generation, and it's kind of taking off into other branches. For me, it's a legacy.\"\nStoops says he can't help but look around and see how profound their impact was.\n\"It goes back to Mike,\" he said. \"And Hal's not talked enough about. He and Mike were joined at the hip. Between the two of them, I don't know that anyone's had a stronger influence on coaches. It goes on and on. The influence is huge. These tentacles from them go all over the place. They branch out from the two of them everywhere.\"\nJake Trotter and Chris Low contributed to this story."}
{"title": "How Texas has gotten bigger, better under Steve Sarkisian", "date": "2023-10-05 13:32:58", "text": "Paul Finebaum breaks down the high stakes for Oklahoma and Texas in their upcoming matchup. (0:40)\nSteve Sarkisian had one key piece of feedback for athletic director Chris Del Conte when he studied his potential roster while interviewing for the Texas coaching job.\n\"We need bigger humans in our program, and we need more of them,\" he recalled at Big 12 media day in 2022. \"The numbers weren't the way I would've liked it and the body structure ... there's just a lot to it.\"\nSarkisian's first year seemed to bear that out. The Longhorns finished 5-7, and he said multiple times there needed to be a lot of new faces on the roster. And there was a reason: The Longhorns' highly touted recruiting classes in 2018 and 2019 brought in nine offensive linemen. But by Sarkisian's first year, four were no longer on the roster.\nNow, as No. 3 Texas sits at 5-0 heading into the annual Red River Rivalry showdown against No. 12 Oklahoma (noon ET, ABC/ESPN App), it'll be the biggest test to date of Sarkisian's project to return Texas to glory.\nLast year, Texas won the golden hat for the first time since 2018 in devastatingly dominant fashion, handing Oklahoma its biggest shutout loss in school history (49-0). It was the highest-scoring game for Texas in the 118-game series. But inconsistency plagued the Longhorns the rest of the season, going 4-3 from then on, en route to an 8-5 finish.\nSo far, those big humans are making their presence felt in Texas' strong start (its first 5-0 start since making the national title game in 2009). On defense, 6-foot-4, 362-pound T'Vondre Sweat is a run-stopping force who has helped the Longhorns allow just 3.07 yards per carry, their fewest in their first five games since 2010, according to ESPN Stats & Information. On the other side, an offensive line that returns all five starters from a year ago averages just over 6-4 and about 325 pounds. Texas is one of seven teams nationally to average more than 190 rushing yards (191.8) and allow fewer than 95 (94.6) per game.\nSarkisian's offense has always been the star attraction. It attracts talent, with his first recruiting class headlined by Ja'Tavion Sanders and Xavier Worthy, who instantly became two of Texas' best and flashiest offensive weapons. He added some strength the next year with DJ Campbell and Kelvin Banks, two of those offensive linemen, who were the most highly rated recruits in the '22 class, according to ESPN Recruiting.\nBut the biggest difference in this year's success over past years has been the defense, which will be tested by a Sooners offense that is No. 3 nationally in scoring (averaging 47.4 points) and No. 7 in passing (352.4 yards).\nThe Longhorns have added big pieces on that side of the ball. In 2023, linebacker Anthony Hill Jr. was a five-star signee who ranked behind only quarterback Arch Manning in the Texas class. He has already made a big impact with two sacks on third-down plays against Alabama, including on the Tide's final offensive drive to help Texas seal the win. Senior transfer Jalen Catalon came from Arkansas and has provided a physical presence at free safety, making seven tackles against Alabama and a big hit on Saturday against Kansas that led to a fumble.\nPlugging newcomers in alongside stars like Jaylan Ford, the preseason Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, has allowed the Longhorns the luxury of newfound depth to rotate heavily.\n\"I think it's been huge,\" Sarkisian said this week of the defense. \"We've gone through first halves of games where we played upwards of 30 guys. Sometimes you don't feel the effect of that rotation in the first half. But naturally, you look at some of these fourth quarters we've been having now. ... I think we're more fresh physically. We're more fresh mentally.\"\nAs a result, the defense is stifling opponents. Compared to their first five games over the past 20 years, the Longhorns are allowing the fewest yards per game since 2010 (290.8). They're pressuring opposing QBs on 37% of plays, best for the Longhorns since ESPN has been tracking the stat in 2011. Opposing QBs are off target on 18% of their passes and have completed just 53.5% of their passes.\nSenior Jahdae Barron said the players can trust that whoever is in the game can get the job done.\n\"When we look to the left and right of each other, we know that we are all brothers, and we've all been through so much throughout the summer, and we know that we are a family,\" Barron said. \"We've built a bond on and off the field so we know how to play for one another and we just keep playing.\"\nIt also has allowed the offense to keep from panicking. On Saturday, the Longhorns led Kansas just 13-7 at halftime. By the end of the game, it was 40-14.\nA year ago, it was likely either running back Bijan Robinson or receiver Worthy would be the stars quarterback Quinn Ewers had to lean on in key moments. On Saturday, Georgia transfer Adonai Mitchell had a career day, catching 10 passes for 141 yards and a touchdown, with Worthy adding seven catches for 93 yards.\nSophomore running back Jonathon Brooks has eclipsed the 100-yard mark in three straight games, including a 218-yard, two-touchdown performance against Kansas. Sanders, who was injured against the Jayhawks, should return and already has two 100-yard receiving games this year as a rare talent at tight end, with five catches for 114 yards against Alabama.\nMitchell was quick to say how much having Worthy on the other side helps him.\n\"It's crazy how much attention he gets and how the defense just has to respect who he is,\" Mitchell said. But Sarkisian said the presence of Mitchell is a difference-maker for Worthy, too.\n\"For Xavier to catch seven balls last year, it would take about 14 or 15 attempts in his direction because everybody knew we have to throw it there,\" Sarkisian said after the Kansas game. \"Now all of a sudden, when you have a complementary receiver on the other side, sooner or later people are going to start paying more attention to No. 5 [Mitchell] and with JT [Sanders] and with Jordan [Whittington] and now the running game with Jonathon the way he's running, now we've got a really good variety of players that the ball can get spread around to.\"\nOf course, all of that helps Ewers, who has an embarrassment of riches and doesn't have to do it all. He's averaging 271 passing yards per game with 10 touchdowns to just one interception. Opponents have gotten pressure on just 24% of his dropbacks, Texas' lowest rate since 2016.\nEwers also has started to trust his running ability when all those offensive threats attract coverage, rushing for 30- and 29-yard touchdowns in the past two games, two of his four rushing scores this year.\n\"He's figured out, 'Man, maybe I'm a little faster than I thought.'\" Sarkisian said.\nIt's all part of what Ewers said was a new dedication this offseason to getting in better shape.\n\"This is where I want to be,\" Ewers said. \"I think I took a lot of time analyzing myself last year and I want to be able to do stuff like this and I think I really worked on it this offseason. For it to start working out, it's pretty cool.\"\nSarkisian said on Monday he's preparing for a bit of a chess match against Oklahoma's Brent Venables, who he said has \"been doing it too long at too high of a level to think they weren't going to get that thing fixed\" after last year's 6-7 meltdown, in which they finished 122nd in total defense, allowing 461 yards per game.\n\"They've got a lot of defense,\" Sarkisian said. \"They've got a lot of coverages. They've got a lot of pressure packages. So you know, it's definitely challenging on that front. Especially when it's all on the same accord and working well together.\"\nBut Texas has been building for this moment. In the two titans' final season in the Big 12, they're both 5-0 for only the third time in the rivalry's history.\n\"We know it's going to be a great challenge,\" Sarkisian said. \"We're looking forward to it, looking forward to seeing our fans in Dallas for, in my opinion, the best setting in college football. This is going to be an awesome environment.\""}
{"title": "Experts: What Brett Favre faces in lawsuit deposition", "date": "2023-10-05 11:58:53", "text": "On the one-year anniversary of Brett Favre being named in a civil suit, here's a look back at the Hall of Famer's involvement in the largest welfare scandal in the history of the state. (3:15)\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services filed notice this week of its intent to depose former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. More than a year ago, Favre was named as one of dozens of defendants in a civil lawsuit that aims to recover tens of millions of dollars in welfare funds a state audit said were misspent. Favre has denied any wrongdoing in the welfare case and has not been criminally charged.\nThe deposition, scheduled for Oct. 26, would be Favre's first time testifying under oath in this case, according to Front Office Sports. The people involved in the case aren't commenting because of a judge's gag order, but several unaffiliated attorneys explained what could happen when Favre arrives at the deposition in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where Favre starred for the University of Southern Mississippi.\nESPN spoke with William W. Berry III, a law professor at the University of Mississippi; Vangela M. Wade, an attorney and leader of the Mississippi Center for Justice; and Matthew Leish, a partner at the law firm Miller Korzenik Sommers Rayman in New York. The legal experts addressed, among other things, the risks that Favre potentially faces during the deposition process, and what he could do to help his case. All three said they do not know details of the case beyond what has been reported and would speak about general legal strategies. Here are their responses, which have been edited for clarity.\nWhat does it mean to be deposed?\nBerry: The idea of a deposition is to get someone's story on the record so that, at trial, they can't change it later. And so it'll obviously be very important for Brett Favre to tell the truth. This is his chance to get his story on the record.\nWade: In any deposition, it's part of discovery, of getting information directly from that person that they're deposing, or having that person to identify documents during the course of that deposition.\nLeish: There are really two goals. One, it's fact gathering. They're trying to find out what this person knows. The second part of it is to try to pin him down to get some admissions that will hurt his case. It can't be a complete fishing expedition, but they have some leeway to explore.\nHow long do depositions last?\nWade: I've seen depositions go anywhere from an hour to three days or longer for one person. It depends on the nature of the litigation and what the party is attempting to cover in that deposition.\nBerry: Most depositions are usually one-day depositions, maybe eight hours. In a more complicated case, it might take longer.\nWhat kinds of risks does Favre face during the deposition?\nLeish: The biggest danger is that he says something under oath that really helps the state prove its case. Maybe he admits something that they're trying to prove or he says something and they can call him out on it and it makes him look like he's not credible. I think those are the two biggest risks.\nHow can a deposition be used as evidence in a potential trial?\nBerry: If the plaintiffs in the case were to call Mr. Favre to testify and then he were to change his story on the stand, you would then cite him back to his deposition and impeach him in court. An impeachment is really showing someone's changing their story and then the credibility that person has with a jury or a judge is shot.\nWhat would help Favre in his deposition?\nLeish: When you're the person being deposed, it's really defensive. You're trying not to give the other side anything they can use. It's not so much that you're trying to prove your case. So his main goal is don't hurt yourself.\nBut having said that, if his testimony is very consistent with what he's saying -- \"I didn't do anything wrong, here's what I knew\" -- and he backs that up, he's got real evidence to support that, it can be useful to him. And the state can say, \"Hold on a second here, maybe we have a problem. Maybe we're going to have a hard time proving our case.\"\nBerry: What discovery is, is really a negotiation on some level in the sense of each party is trying to marshal, each lawyer is trying to figure out the best they can what really happened. So often you see these disputes in the media and you have the \"he said and she said,\" but then you start drilling down and you look at the actual evidence in the case and what evidence do you have and putting the evidence together.\nThen you get a sense of, \"Wow, this person really did something they weren't supposed to.\" Or alternatively, \"The allegation, it looked that way, but this person actually didn't do anything wrong.\""}
{"title": "Lowe: Why the Rockets' Jalen Green might be the most important swing player in the NBA", "date": "2023-10-05 13:56:46", "text": "AS COACHES AND players trudged into the locker room at halftime of what would become yet another dispiriting loss -- one of 62 for the 2021-22 Houston Rockets, a team built to lose in its first full season since the end of the James Harden era -- they heard an unusual voice command attention.\n\"You're supposed to lead by example,\" Jalen Green, then a 19-year-old rookie and No. 2 overall draft pick, chastised one of the few veterans on the team -- a player Green and others present won't identify today. Other players and coaches had noticed that veteran playing with a halfhearted selfishness. Only Green spoke up. \"We need you to be better,\" Green continued. \"You're supposed to show us how to do this.\"\nGreen was calm and measured, witnesses recall.\n\"He did it from a place of, 'I'm seeking knowledge,'\" John Lucas, the longtime Rockets assistant coach who now works in the front office, told ESPN. \"It made Jalen a leader among the younger guys.\"\nThere was no retort, no heated back-and-forth. \"The truth has no feelings,\" Lucas said.\n\"It was about showing everyone needs to be held accountable,\" Green told ESPN.\nEighteen months later, Green is the highest draft pick and headliner of one of the NBA's deepest pools of young talent -- the product of three straight losing seasons in which the Rockets won just 59 combined games and prioritized their own first-round picks.\nIn Green, Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, Houston has six high-wattage prospects -- including three top-four picks in Thompson, Smith, and Green. The Rockets have surrounded them with veterans in Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jeff Green, and Jock Landale. (They nearly snagged Brook Lopez from the Milwaukee Bucks, sources said.)\nThe veterans are around to teach habits and help the Rockets win more; Houston owes its 2024 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, protected for the top four draft slots -- the first of two painful debts stemming from the Daryl Morey regime's ill-fated 2019 swap of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook in a desperate bid to placate Harden. By the cold reality of incentives, the losing has to stop.\nMeanwhile, Houston's front office already has to look years ahead: Is it even possible to pay all six of those young guys second contracts under this new collective bargaining agreement -- even with restricted free agency still a powerful cudgel? If none of those players becomes a No. 1-level superstar, how do the Rockets find one? Or does the talent fit so well as to compensate for the lack of that amorphous \"best player on a title team\" -- becoming (one day) one of those greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts contenders? What Green remains a low-percentage shooter who doesn't bring enough outside of points? What if the whole thing fizzles?\nRight now, Green probably represents their best chance at that superstar -- the apex ball handler. He has internal competition. Thompson has star potential. Smith surged last season, blew up in summer league, and seems poised for another leap in Year 2 on both ends. Sengun could be an All-Star-level producer on offense as soon as this season -- in part because of his promising two-man game with Green -- though Sengun has to reach a passable level on defense.\nBut Green has tantalizing scoring tools and a willingness, he and his coaches say, to lean into more of a playmaking role and to give more effort on defense. In Year 3, he now has to live the message he delivered to that would-be veteran mentor: play unselfishly, play hard, play defense -- always.\nVanVleet is the new point guard, but the Rockets still want the ball in Green's hands. (The Rockets have banished Kevin Porter Jr. from the team as he faces domestic violence charges. The basketball impact -- way down the list of what matters in the Porter case -- is that Green and the rest of Houston's young core will have more opportunities to handle the ball.)\nVanVleet's ability to work off the ball is one reason Houston's decision-makers, including new head coach Ime Udoka, preferred VanVleet over a free agency reunion with Harden.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.' If we want Jalen and the young guys to take the next steps, we need them to have the ball. As for me saying I don't want James, that was never the case. It was about fit.\"\nIt is on Green to pay off that faith by digging deeper into nonscoring aspects of the game.\n\"This is a huge year for him,\" Rafael Stone, the Rockets general manager, told ESPN. \"It's on him to really put together all the things he's worked on. You see individual games where he's locked in -- whether it's on-ball defense, help-side defense, making the right reads in the pick-and-roll. And then there are other games where he just kind of let go of the rope. He's a bucket. It's about all the little things.\"\nA lot of young lottery picks chase points. For some players and their agents, points are the best vehicle to that first big payday. But Houston's coaches are unanimous that Green can become more well-rounded in a season where winning has suddenly become a priority. And where Green ends up in three, four, five years along an unusually wide possibility of outcomes could make or break this new Houston experiment.\n\"He's growing into a pro,\" said Lucas, who worked closely with Green during his rookie season, tweaking Green's jumper and quickening the release. \"His savvy is coming. He's an absolute delight to work with.\"\nGreen said he's ready.\n\"I can contribute to winning,\" he told ESPN. \"I'm an all-around player.\"\nGREEN'S COMBINATION OF speed, burst, and leaping ability is rare even among players toward the top of the draft. During his 1-on-0 pre-draft workout with the Rockets, Green lost the ball on the way up during a layup drill, reached out in midair to snare it, and dunked with power. \"It was like, 'Holy s---, I haven't seen that one before,'\" Stone recalled. \"His athleticism popped. He has one of the highest ceilings of any player that has been drafted recently, and we are in the business of drafting for upside.\"\nOne executive from another team drafting around Green's range told his front office that Green could lead the league in scoring one day.\n\"I have never coached anyone like him,\" Brad Roznovsky, who coached Green for three years at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno, California, told ESPN. \"And I never will again.\"\nAt age 20 on a rebuilding Rockets team -- facing elite defenders almost every game -- Green averaged 22 points and almost four assists. He knifed his way to six free throws per game. Some high-usage ball handlers never average that many free throws. Green was inefficient, but he is on a clear All-Star trajectory.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nRival executives often project his potential peak as similar to those of Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and some statistical models suggest those as decent comparisons. They are also close to Green's height (6-foot-4), a tick shorter than the big wing ball-handlers who often rule the league.\nBeal and LaVine have made five combined All-Star teams, and that number should jump. Beal made one All-NBA team. Those are objectively good outcomes, even for a much-hyped No. 2 pick with Green's scoring chops.\nBut neither has ever been the No. 1 option on a dangerous postseason team. Beal is now the third option on a contender in the Phoenix Suns. LaVine's Chicago Bulls have flatlined in mediocrity. The Rockets aren't putting any ceiling on Green yet, and they shouldn't.\nStill, there is an enormous gap between where Green is now and All-Star-level efficiency. Green shot 41.6% last season -- 33.8% on 3s, 47.1% on 2s. He converted just 55% at the rim.\nThere is low-hanging fruit to pluck. Green chucks up a lot of low-chance jumpers early in the clock when one pass or dribble would keep the offense chugging toward something better.\nGreen has taken (by a hair) more pull-up 3s than catch-and-shoot treys in his career, per NBA.com. He's capable of hitting those shots, but too many come early in possessions. Some are off-balance, over multiple defenders.\n\"There were just too many possessions where he took poor shots with three guys on him,\" Udoka said.\nAlmost one-third of Green's shots in 2022-23 were midrangers, a ton by the standards of the analytics-heavy Rockets. The team is fine with those looks late in the shot clock. They know elite defenses sometimes snuff everything else. Green hit 42% on long 2s last season, and has a knack for stopping on a dime, rising into the clouds, and generating clean on-balance looks. With more judiciousness, that percentage could climb into the high-40s.\nBut the team would like Green to bag contested pull-up 2s that come with time left to explore.\n\"What's important for Jalen is making sure he takes virtually none of those,\" Stone said. \"If that shot [a long 2] is contested, there has to be a better shot for someone else.\"\nOn some of those plays, the right pass is in front of him:\nWatch Sengun roll free then turn his palms to the sky in exasperation after Green jacks a long 2 with 12 seconds on the shot clock instead of threading the pocket pass.\nWhat's both encouraging and frustrating is that Green has those passes in his bag. When trapped, Green is happy to slip the ball to an open teammate immediately.\nThere are plenty of instances of Green making the basic pocket pass as soon as it opens:\nThen just a minute later -- as in that game against the Bulls -- Green might ignore that identical pocket pass in favor of a wayward drive, or toss it too late:\nGreen attempted shots on about 47% of his pick-and-rolls that resulted in the end of possessions -- 43rd among 174 ball handlers who ran at least 200 such plays, per Second Spectrum. Green dished assists on only 9.8% of those actions -- 163rd among that 174-player sample.\nGreen is determined to find a better pass-or-shoot balance.\n\"It's simple reads,\" Green said. \"The pocket pass to Alpie [Sengun], or if the low man helps over, hitting that shooter in the corner.\"\nGREEN SPENT MUCH of the summer in Los Angeles, training with a personal coach -- Adam Harrington, a former assistant for both the Thunder and the Nets -- and participating in 5-on-5 runs with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and other NBA stars. Udoka watched a lot of those pickup games, including one in which Green and Smith were on the same team -- facing a squad that included both Durant and Booker.\n\"In my mind, it was Houston against Phoenix,\" Udoka said. He saw progress in Green's passing.\n\"He has the ability to make the right play,\" Udoka continued. \"You don't always see it on a young team where it's your turn, my turn, and guys are taking poor shots at times. But when the level of talent is raised around him, he makes the right reads. Now there are no excuses. I've seen you do it.\"\nObserving those pickup games, Udoka would sometimes shout for Green to set a flare screen or cut to the rim. Green has flashed some instincts to cut back door when Sengun -- a clever passer -- has the ball at the elbow. Those plays hint at a decent feel -- something that should translate to passing.\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBut they were mere flashes. Houston's offense last season was stagnant. Porter and Green pounded the air out of the ball. On some possessions, they had to wait several seconds before a Houston big man realized he should run up to set a screen. There was no structure, no pace. Spacing was cluttered.\n\"There was a lot of standing around,\" Udoka said.\nLike a lot of young guards, Green sometimes dribbled around the arc without purpose -- bobbing and weaving in the general area of picks without going anywhere. He sometimes rushed through moves, zooming forward before really executing them -- before giving defenders a chance to take the bait.\nVanVleet should loosen spacing and allow Green to attack more off the catch -- with the floor in motion. \"We want to use him more off the ball,\" Udoka said of Green. \"We want him coming off screens and slashing. I don't know if it's natural for him, but you've seen glimpses.\"\nSpacing remains a challenge. Defenses will ignore both Brooks and Eason on the perimeter until they prove themselves as shooters; against certain Houston lineups, defenses had centers guard Eason and hang near the paint. (Eason, by the way, has a chance to be a really good two-way player. He seems to have magnets in his hands, sucking up steals and rebounds that appear out of reach. The Rockets are optimistic he can do more with the ball on offense.) With Sengun and Landale, it might be hard for Udoka to get to lineups in which Smith plays small-ball center.\nGreen oozes ballhandling craft that he is just starting to harness. He can lull defenders to sleep with languid hesitation dribbles toward picks, and then dust them by darting away from those screens. He works nasty in-and-out dribbles with either hand:\nGreen is slim, but at 6-foot-4 with his speed and leaping ability, he could develop a Westbrook-esque style of turbocharged drives through smaller point guard defenders:\nGreen can get to the rim almost at will. His approach and judgment once there has been addled. Green has a habit of flying at rim protectors without a plan and throwing up wild, flailing hope shots.\n\"You have to know where your dump-offs are,\" Udoka said. \"Jalen is used to being able to finish over anyone, but if you get separation and Joel Embiid is sitting in the paint, you can take the midranger instead of attacking him.\"\nIN OFFSEASON WORKOUTS, Harrington slowed everything down and had Green walk through the final two or three steps of every typical action over and over: planting to catch the ball running off a pick; rising for a contested layup; leaping for a pull-up 3; loading off one foot to take a Ray Allen-style leaning jumper.\n\"It was about balance,\" Green said. Harrington wanted Green to feel what each foot should be doing -- to download the body mechanics so that he is comfortable, strong, and poised in every situation.\nThat could lead to more plays where it all comes together:\nThere are not many 20-year-olds who can work all those skills -- all those changes of direction and cadence -- into one pick-and-roll. Green slithers to his right around that Sengun screen then slows down to pin his defender on his hip -- waiting for Sengun to find space. Green veers left, then back right -- finally getting Xavier Tillman to commit and unlocking that hook pass.\nGreen spent a lot of time in L.A. around Durant, watching him work and listening to Durant's advice. Durant told Green that every practice and drill should mimic game intensity.\n\"That's what stuck with me -- to really make everything game-like,\" Green said.\nThe harder work comes on defense. Green has been a pretty glaring minus on that end. Bigger opponents have bullied him, and Green has gotten lost now and then in rotation.\nBut Green can become at least an average defender. He has good length, and he seems to care. His lean frame has its advantages. Harrington developed a mantra for him: Avoid every screen.\n\"We've argued a lot,\" Lucas said about Green when the subject turned to defense. \"Jalen can guard when he wants to. He just hasn't been required to yet.\"\n(Lucas loves needling Green to get under his skin and motivate him. He sometimes asks Green where he was selected in the draft. When Green replies that he was the second pick, Lucas -- the top pick in 1976 -- boasts that he might have already been at the after party or even asleep by the time the second pick rolled around in his draft. \"He gets so mad,\" Lucas said, laughing. When Lucas finds out Green admires an opposing player -- De'Aaron Fox and Anthony Edwards, as examples -- he tells Green that if he is such a fan, Lucas can walk to the opponent locker room and ask for a pair of signed shoes.)Top stories of the week from Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\n\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nDefense is not optional under Udoka. \"Defense is more of a mentality,\" the coach said. \"He will be challenged a lot more.\"\nUdoka spares no one in film sessions. \"You'll get called out if you are the weak link,\" Udoka said. \"I'll call him out in front of the whole team. I'm equal opportunity in that.\"\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the mental and physical burden of being a true NBA superstar. Entire defenses are designed to stop you. They change schemes several times within quarters, trying to get in your head. Every possession involves a half-dozen small decisions, all made under pressure. You have to at least execute on defense. And you have to do it 82 times -- and then 10 or 15 or 20 more times in the postseason, when the talent is better, the coaching is more targeted, and everything is done with more urgency.\nLucas is confident. \"In another year, he will really be a professional,\" Lucas said of Green. \"Next season [2024-25], he is going to take off like Ja Morant and Devin Booker.\"\nEven optimists know how much distance lies between where Green is now and where those guys -- and Beal, even LaVine -- have reached. Perhaps it's best to approach this season with smaller goals.\n\"I want to be better for my teammates,\" Green said. \"I'm always going to be able to score. Now, it's more about contributing to my team in other ways.\""}
{"title": "What's it like to be recruited by Deion Sanders? Prospects, parents give the inside scoop", "date": "2023-10-05 04:15:26", "text": "Deion Sanders is encouraged by Colorado's performance in its loss against USC and warns the Buffaloes' detractors about what's coming. (0:55)\nWHEN ADRIAN WALKER scheduled his unofficial visit to Colorado for the Week 3 game against Colorado State, he had no idea he'd be there with Lil Wayne, Master P, Offset and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\nBut that's exactly where Walker and the other recruits on campus found themselves, in what is now the new norm with Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes. It's not just locker room tours and meetings with coaches, recruits are seeing a whole different pitch from Sanders and his staff.\n\"It was crazy that Lil Wayne was right there,\" said Walker, a 2025 wide receiver recruit. \"I shook The Rock's hand and to be in that type of moment was crazy. Being that close to celebrities and being in that moment was unbelievable.\"\nThe parade of celebrities, which included musicians and hall of fame athletes, continued at Saturday's game against the USC Trojans.\n\"Deion can bring these guys out based off of him and the relationships that he has with people,\" Mantrez Walker, a 2025 linebacker recruit who visited for the USC game, said. \"A player might come back [at a different school] if he's an alumni, or he's being honored for something, but nowhere else is going to have all those guys in one place.\"\nThe first three weeks of the season -- with wins over TCU, Nebraska and Colorado State -- brought the starpower and hype to Colorado, which went 1-11 last season. The next two games -- losses to Oregon and USC -- have shown how far the roster needs to go.\nIn the three recruiting classes before Sanders' arrival, Colorado didn't finish higher than 34th in the ESPN recruiting class rankings. In two of those classes (2021, 2022), the Buffaloes did not sign an ESPN 300 prospect.\nColorado's 2024 recruiting class has eight total commitments, including two ranked in the ESPN 300 with Aaron Butler and Brandon Davis-Swain. Sanders is still trying to add to that 2024 class and make a splash by going after some big targets, including five-star Texas A&M commit Cam Coleman, who visited for the USC game. He is getting a head start in 2025, and had Mantrez Walker, ESPN Junior 300 receiver Taz Williams Jr. and ESPN Jr. 300 defensive end Christopher Burgess Jr. on campus for the game against the Trojans, as well.\nSanders has had stunning recruiting wins the past two cycles, flipping elite playmakers and using the transfer portal to bring 86 new players into the program in one offseason. When Sanders was at Jackson State from 2020-2022, he flipped five-star cornerback Travis Hunter from Florida State on national signing day in the 2022 cycle. He did it again in 2023 when he got five-star defensive back Cormani McClain to Colorado from Miami.\nRecruits from the 2024 and 2025 classes and their parents are paying attention. Not just to the hype, but to the no-nonsense, disciplinarian coach at the center of the process and the two-time consensus All-American, two-time Super Bowl winner and Pro and College Football Hall of Famer who has succeeded in every part of the sport.\n\"He makes the time to make you feel special and he puts it all on the table,\" Leon Edwards, the father of CU freshman running back Dylan Edwards, a former ESPN 300 recruit, said. \"It was a no-brainer from there, because it's just Deion is the truth and he puts the truth on the table and those kids just absorb it. They want to play for someone that has done the things that he has done and has stood on his word.\n\"I think that's where he wins.\"\nSANDERS IS FOND of saying, \"I ain't hard to find,\" when talking to recruits and detractors alike. Recruits, however, should not expect an open line to the Colorado coach.\n\"I don't think Coach Prime gives his number to any recruit, from what I know,\" Butler, a 2024 CU commit and the No. 80 prospect in the ESPN 300, told ESPN. \"It's just how he is and he doesn't want dudes just having his number. When you're playing for him, it's serious, it ain't no fandom. His job is to coach and when you get there, he's going to coach you.\"\nIf a recruit wants to talk to Sanders or he wants to talk to a recruit, an assistant coach will facilitate it. When it comes to recruiting, Sanders is as personable and hands-on as he can be, especially when recruits and families are on campus.\n\"He's just a laid-back person, he just talks about life. He said [on a visit], 'Don't lie to a kid,' and that really made my mom smile,\" ESPN 300 recruit Kamron Mikell said. \"I think recruits are drawn to him, because people see him as somebody who turns us kids into believers and he makes everyone believe in themselves.\"\nWhen Davis-Swain, a defensive end recruit, arrived at Pasta Jay's during an official visit to Colorado in June, he and his father, Brandon Davis, saw a more laid-back version of Sanders.\nPasta Jay's, a quaint 35-year-old Italian restaurant in Boulder with a sign out front that reads \"Prime for President,\" has become Sanders' go-to place for hosting recruits and their families on official visits.\nInside, Sanders and the recruits have the place to themselves. The Buffaloes' coach held court as the appetizers rolled out, followed by what seemed like unlimited pizza and pasta.\nDavis had been around Sanders briefly on the visit, but never in this relaxed, intimate setting. He didn't know what to expect and was still a little star struck, realizing he was eating dinner with Deion Sanders.\n\"It's Prime Time,\" Davis said with a big laugh.\nThese on-campus visits might be much more valuable during this recruiting cycle. After having surgery in March 2022 to have two toes amputated and part of a muscle taken out to help with circulation, Sanders had not been able to travel. Sanders had another procedure over the summer to relieve blood clots in both legs. Because of that, Colorado recruits and their families haven't been able to spend as much time in-person with Sanders.\nWhen Butler and his family took an official visit to Colorado in April, they met Sanders in a room off his personal office.\nThe room has a wall of windows overlooking Folsom Field with the mountains in the distance. Sanders typically sits in a leather chair that feels purposefully higher off the ground than where the prospects are sitting.\nThe conversations are more akin to the Pasta Jay's experience than they are the flash and extravagance. They can range from how the prospect fits on the field, what is expected of them, life lessons or sometimes just cracking jokes. And they quickly get past Sanders' celebrity.\nComplete recruiting coverage »\n2024 recruits you need to know »\nClass rankings » | ESPN 300 »\nStorylines to watch » | Latest commits »\nRecapping the 2023 recruiting cycle »\n\"It was right after they had offered me and [Sanders] pulled a couple of us [recruits] aside and had a sit-down with him for about 30 minutes,\" Talan Chandler, a three-star offensive line commit, said. \"It's Coach Prime, you're meeting with Deion Sanders and you're shell shocked, but he's just such a charismatic guy and he's super genuine. He doesn't have an ego, he doesn't think he's better than you and he makes you feel like he cares about you.\"\nThere are plenty of coaches who relate to recruits, but Sanders, according to Walker, has different qualities that differentiate him from other coaches.\n\"Having a coach who went through the recruiting process, went through the collegiate process and went to the NFL,\" Walker said. \"Being coached by a guy like that and in a place where you can be you and you can get your name out there. You can get the connections you need, you can develop, he's not afraid to play freshman and he's a player's coach.\n\"It's all those things combined.\"\nRobb-Davon and Courtney Butler, the parents of Aaron Butler, have known Sanders since Robb and Sanders played together for a season with the Baltimore Ravens. He knew Prime Time, and they didn't fully know how Sanders would be different.\n\"Make no bones about it, Coach Prime is a different man than Prime Time. Prime doesn't have anybody on his team that's like him in terms of the character Prime Time,\" Robb-Davon Butler said. \"He wouldn't have any of it. There's no way you can get away with being how he was when he was in that age or even as a pro and play for him. There is individuality, but there are no individuals above the team.\"\nSanders' attention to detail, the people he has surrounded himself with and how important every recruit seems to be is something the Butler family said they had not experienced at many other schools. When Courtney had surgery, the Colorado staff sent her cards wishing her well on the procedure, they were shocked that they even remembered the surgery was taking place let alone the date.\nDavis told Sanders about being a single father and raising his son Brandon, the struggle it has taken to get to this point and how their future could be impacted through his son getting an opportunity to play college football. Every time Davis was on campus or with Sanders, he said the two would sit as if there were no other obligations the coach needed to take care of.\nThe parents are an important part of the recruiting process for Sanders and his staff, as they are at most schools, and the staff makes it a point of emphasis to make them feel welcome, as well.\nWhile at Pasta Jay's, the families and recruits all eat, but there will be times where the parents hang back at the restaurant with some of the coaches while the recruits continue their visit or tours with players or personnel staff. Sanders and his coaches will often bring board games and playing cards and play games with the parents, talking, joking and showing that down-to-earth side that most have now experienced.\n​​\"Deion could go host the Grammy's or he can come sit in your backyard at a family barbecue,\" Omar Stoutmire, the father of 2023 Colorado signee Carter Stoutmire, said. \"You'd be shocked at how down to earth he is, he's like a chameleon.\"\nWHILE SANDERS EMBRACES the hype of being Prime Time for outsiders, something is different inside the program, according to recruits.\n\"His principles, like if you're talking to him and you're slouching, he'll make you sit up and he'll get on you,\" Chandler said. \"He holds everything to a top standard and there's just something about that, that's very, I'd say attractive to a recruit.\n\"Like, that's excellence right there.\"\nSanders tells recruits to sit up or tuck in their shirts. Cursing isn't allowed and Sanders tells players to take off their hats, something Colorado State coach Jay Norvell criticized Sanders about. The players who can deal with those standards are the ones who stick around. The players who don't will know up front that Sanders won't let anything slide just because they're a five-star or an instant-impact transfer.\nWhen Sanders flipped McClain from Miami in the last recruiting cycle, it was a big win for the program and Sanders at the last minute. McClain, however, did not play in the first three games of the season before playing late in the blowout loss to the Oregon Ducks and most of the USC game, where he broke up a pass in the end zone.\nAfter the Oregon game, Sanders was asked what McClain could do to see more playing time.\n\"Study. Prepare. Be on time for meetings. Show up to the dern meetings. Understand what we're doing as a scheme,\" Sanders said. \"Want to play this game. Desire to play this game. Desire to be the best in this game at practice, in the film room and on your own free time.\"\nSanders preaches the same accountability in the recruiting process and doesn't promise anything to prospects.\n\"Oftentimes when coaches recruit, the recruits come in and the recruits are interviewing the coaches. We're interviewing the recruits to make sure you have the intangibles,\" Sanders said on \"College GameDay.\" \"Smart, tough, fast, disciplined with character. But not only that, that you love the game. You've got an affinity and passion for the game.\"\nButler was recruited by major programs, including Alabama, Georgia, Miami, Oregon, Washington. He saw the accountability and character as a differentiator and something that attracted him even more to what Sanders was building.\n\"​​Just being around [Sanders] when I was up there and then through the recruiting process, you can see the main goal and the main thing is winning and, before anything else, getting the right dudes in there,\" Butler said. \"He's not going to let you slack off or slouch in front of him. He's going to make sure you're ready to perform and perform at the level that you're expected to.\"\nIt wasn't always that way, though, as Butler took a visit to Colorado in March before the mass offseason exodus that saw 47 players enter the portal during the spring transfer window in April. Butler wasn't impressed with the talent on the field and wasn't sure Colorado would be the place where he could compete against the best and achieve his goals.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nHe came home from the visit with the feeling he could have started immediately on that roster. When he saw Sanders turning over the roster and bringing in more talent, he was excited about what that would mean for the future and for his recruitment.\n\"Being in that environment, I get to prove myself and it's a great opportunity because in a room with the right type of dudes pushing me, the type of dudes they have right now,\" Butler said. \"I'm looking at going there and competing with the top [players], so just having the opportunity to work with Travis Hunter and get better with him and push him to get better, it's a beautiful thing. If you're somebody, you're not going to sit on the back of the porch and want to play with the little pups, you gotta jump out there and really show what it is to everybody right off the rip.\"\nIt's that mentality Sanders is searching for. By being strict and sticking to who he is during the recruiting process, he's targeting prospects with a similar mentality.\nWhile Colorado's 2024 class has just three four-star commits, Sanders and his staff still have time until the early signing period in late December as well as the transfer portal periods to add to the class. Sanders might even flip another high-profile recruit like he has done in the past two classes.\nColeman visited Colorado for the USC game despite his commitment to the Aggies. He's the No. 8 prospect overall and would be a third five-star to flip to the program if Sanders is able to pull it off. Colorado is also heavily recruiting five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood, the top prospect in the 2025 class. Underwood visited Colorado for the Colorado State game.\nThese are the kinds of players Sanders will need to land to turn Colorado from the best show in college football to a legit contender. Those already on board won't bet against him.\n\"He's charismatic and genuine and the people that he brings around him are all the same, they all just have that love and passion for football,\" Chandler said. \"He's building a culture and brings a championship mindset around him. To be recruited by him, as he tells you, we're coming here to win championships. This is what we want, we want excellence here.\""}
{"title": "How a film obsession and rock, paper, scissors explain why Commanders are so high on Sam Howell", "date": "2023-10-05 13:19:41", "text": "Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Howell looks ahead to Thursday night's game against the Chicago Bears. (0:41)\nASHBURN, Va. -- Sam Howell needed to make a choice.\nIt was a day before North Carolina's 2019 spring game, and the true freshman quarterback was playing rock, paper, scissors to determine which candidate for the starting quarterback job would get first chance at impressing the coaches.\nHowell won (he chose scissors), and it was the only opportunity he needed.\nHowell was competing with two redshirt freshmen for the job: Cade Fortin and Jace Ruder. Howell's talent was obvious. But coach Mack Brown didn't know how he'd handle the pressure.\n• The rise of Commanders QB Sam Howell\n• Claypool adds to Bears' legacy of issues\n• Rookie QB Richardson's poise key for Colts\n• Bills offense chasing history\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\nBut when Howell took the field, he delivered on one of his first throws.\n\"He turned it loose and zipped it. It was a perfect strike. We all said, 'Wow,'\" Brown said. \"That was one of the first times we knew he wasn't going to panic in front of people.\"\nThere were hiccups: Howell tossed three picks early in those spring practices. He didn't throw another one.\n\"I was worried about him losing his confidence,\" Brown said. \"He didn't even blink. Very mature for his age and experience. He does not get rattled.\"\nThose traits helped enable Howell to go from becoming North Carolina's first true freshman starting quarterback to being named the ACC's rookie of the year. His 38 touchdown passes set an FBS record for a freshman. He helped elevate the Tar Heels almost immediately before leaving after three years as the school's record holder in 27 different categories, including passing yards (10,283), passing touchdowns (92) and career passing efficiency (164.2).\nLooking back to that first season at North Carolina, it's clear why there's a belief Howell can succeed in the NFL. From his preparation to his demeanor, Howell displayed key traits that helped him go from a prized recruit, to early enrollee, to program-changer.\nIt's what Washington hopes he'll become for a franchise that hasn't had the same quarterback as full-time starter for more than three seasons since 1993, and hasn't had a first-team All-Pro quarterback since Joe Theismann in 1983.\n\"He's special,\" said Brown, whose first season at UNC coincided with Howell's, \"and he's the reason we're sitting here where we are. [North Carolina] won five games in the two years before us, then went to four straight bowls. If you ask me the No. 1 reason, it would be Sam Howell.\"\n.\nHOWELL SAT AT his locker on Sept. 27, casually chatting with a media member. Moments later, he was having a conversation with backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, whose locker was next to his. Next, someone from the equipment room wandered over for a brief exchange. It would have been difficult for an outsider to have known just three days earlier, Howell had thrown four interceptions in a 37-3 loss to the Buffalo Bills -- his worst performance as a pro.\n\"I put that game behind me and worry about the next game,\" Howell said of his philosophy. \"I go back to my process, doing what's always worked for me and never losing that confidence.\n\"Ever since the game ended Sunday, I was excited for the next game just because I'm ready for another opportunity, I'm ready to go out there and play like myself again.\"\nThe next game: He threw for 290 yards and one touchdown in an overtime loss to the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles.\nThat demeanor was shaped long ago. Howell has always been low-key about his success and didn't panic over his miscues.\n\"As far as getting emotional, that's never been him,\" said his father, Duke, who was his offensive coordinator at Sun Valley High School in the Charlotte area. \"When he was in high school, he would throw a pick and I was up in the booth and I'd get on the headset and all I could do was hear him breathe. He never said a word. I'd ask what happened and he'd say such and such. I'd go back and watch the film and, yeah, that did happen.\"\nIt's part of why Howell is comfortable in tense situations. In the last two minutes of the half and regulation this season, he has thrown for a league-high 375 yards with three touchdowns to one interception. Washington has scored 34 points in those situations, including a tying touchdown on the final play of regulation Sunday. The 23-year-old Howell said in the huddle his job is to, \"Just try to calm the storm.\"\nIt's what he did as a collegiate freshman as well. Howell created a buzz for himself and the Tar Heels program in the season opener -- a 24-20 comeback win over South Carolina.\n\"They were so much more talented,\" former Tar Heels offensive coordinator Phil Longo said of the Gamecocks.\nThe Tar Heels trailed by 11 entering the fourth quarter, but Howell completed 5 of 6 passes for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns in the final 15 minutes. He led two 90-yard drives. In his first collegiate game, Howell threw for 245 yards and two scores.\n\"When we were down, he'd say, 'Coach I got this,'\" Brown said. \"He never blinked.\"\n\"I never saw his face change,\" said Dyami Brown, a former Tar Heels receiver and current Commanders teammate. \"His demeanor was always the same. That helped us out because when you don't see a quarterback panicking or freaking out, you feel comfortable. He always kept his composure.\"\nTHE TRAITS HOWELL earned praise for later were evident in high school. Howell's father said he would watch his games on Hudl, a website that posts game video.\n\"He would stay on Hudl and he would always just study it,\" Duke said.\nDuke said he and the quarterbacks coach were once watching film and trying to decipher another team's coverage. Howell, then a sophomore, walked past, glanced at the screen, relayed the coverage and left.\n\"We were like, 'Yep, that's what they're running,'\" Duke said. \"He had a knack for it, but a lot of that is from a lot of work.\"\nIt didn't end when he got to college; it intensified.\n\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\n\"He was always in the building,\" Mack Brown said. \"He has no hobbies. He's a football junkie, a gym rat. Before he had his current girlfriend, it was Valentine's Day and I said, 'You got a date? Doing anything? He said, 'Yeah, I've got a date with Madden.' We used to laugh and say he's been in the building more than I have.\"\nDuke witnessed his son's football evolution in the spring of 2020, when he lived at home during the pandemic. He'd catch Howell on videoconferences with his Tar Heels coaches.\n\"Just the things he knew, that he had learned in one year, they put a lot on him,\" Duke said. \"He was talking about defensive fronts, knowing the fronts to check to a good play. Most quarterbacks are studying coverages. He was more IDing the front, making calls, what the protections are, checking the protections. Stuff like that; he was light years ahead from the year before.\"\nBecause Howell enrolled in January -- cutting short his senior year of high school -- he needed to catch up fast. Howell did not have a veteran quarterback to learn from. His two competitors were both redshirt freshmen. But, at a time when he should have been prepping for his final high school baseball season, he was displaying his promise in UNC's spring practices.\n\"We went to town on learning the offense,\" said Longo, now at Wisconsin. \"We set up a schedule to meet and he didn't miss a minute. He pounded the film and he'd come in every day and have a list of questions and have an agenda. He's just incredible from a want-to standpoint. His talent was ahead in the spring. Everything else was by the summer.\"\nPersonal quarterback coach Anthony Boone said that rapid growth is not surprising. He has experienced it while working with Howell as well.\n\"It's not something you had to tell him; he just did it,\" Boone said. \"He read online, 'This is what quarterbacks do,' and he took it to heart.\"\nHOWELL WAS RECRUITED by almost every big-time program, including Alabama, Ohio State and Clemson. Howell settled on Florida State but flipped to North Carolina after it hired Longo, previously at Ole Miss, as offensive coordinator.\nAt one point, Howell was going to also play baseball in college, a plan he abandoned after finding football success his freshman year.\nHowell is a natural athlete. As a high school junior, he was a pitcher whose fastball was clocked at 93 mph. Howell's ERA was 0.60, and pro scouts were interested.\nHe also played safety and linebacker in high school. One college coach told his dad he would have recruited him as a linebacker, had he not been a quarterback.\nAfter his sophomore year in college, Duke Howell bought Sam a set of golf clubs. Sam golfs only between February and June, not wanting it to interfere with the football season. Two years later, he accompanied his dad on a golf trip and shot an 82.\n\"Never had a lesson, but he's so competitive,\" Duke said. \"The average guy can't stay focused. [Sam] competes on every shot. Every shot. It's because he's mentally tough; it doesn't matter what sport.\n\"He's a highly focused individual. The biggest trait he has, obviously he's competitive, but his toughness is what he drives off of. Not just physically tough, but mentally tough.\"\nALL THE ELEMENTS that made Howell a success in the past have led the Commanders to believe he'll do the same in the NFL.\nBefore the 2022 draft, one member of the organization said they would have targeted Howell in the second or third round had they not already traded for Carson Wentz that offseason. Duke said the family was told pre-draft to expect Sam to be selected anywhere between the 20th and 40th picks.\nThen he lasted until the fifth round.\n\"There was never a doubt in my mind that Sam [could] produce or play at this level,\" Commanders offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. \"I was shocked that he went as late as he did.\"\nIn January, Rivera named Howell the starter going into offseason workouts. He never relinquished the position and, after the second preseason game, Rivera named him the starter for the season opener.\n\"He's now more than a serviceable quarterback,\" Rivera said. \"He's a guy that's growing. He's a guy that can win. ... I'm excited for it, excited for the team.\"\nHowell is showing that growth, whether by becoming more involved in film sessions -- communicating with receivers what he wants on certain routes -- or by understanding how to handle a situation better.\nIf Howell continues on an upward path, then Washington has a starting quarterback on an inexpensive contract through the 2025 season, allowing it to invest at other positions.\nOn Monday, Rivera said he expected Howell to have a strong performance against Philadelphia after struggling versus Buffalo. Howell had a career-best 76.4 quarterback rating -- a week after enduring his worst (18.4).\n\"He's a very resilient, very tough-minded young man. He bounces back very well at a lot of things,\" Rivera said. \"With him, you're going to have some really good positive plus moments, there's going to be some tough moments. He'll get better and better. I've always been confident in him and just been very optimistic about his potential.\""}
{"title": "'Where receivers go to die': 15 years later, does the quote about Chicago still ring true?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:19:41", "text": "Pat McAfee and his crew share their concerns about the Chicago Bears and QB Justin Fields. (2:48)\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Weeks ahead of the 2023 season, Chicago Bears receiver Darnell Mooney decided to rewatch one of the toughest moments of his career. It was Oct. 5, 2022, when the Bears hosted the Washington Commanders, and both offenses struggled. But with 30 seconds remaining and the Commanders leading 12-7, the Bears had a chance at a game-winning touchdown with a fourth-and-goal on the Washington 4.\nBears quarterback Justin Fields faked a toss and lofted a pass to Mooney, who jumped and nearly caught the ball while he was above the goal line for the touchdown, but he bobbled it and didn't secure the ball until he was driven out of the end zone by inches.\nWashington ball -- and game. Mooney said he was being \"accountable\" by watching every detail of that play as a new season neared, one with the promise of putting the bad memories of a three-win disaster in the rearview mirror. But with the Bears now at 0-4 after losing their 14th straight on Sunday, and more receiver drama unfolding with Chase Claypool, the echoes of a defining quote reverberated through Halas Hall.\nIt's the 15th anniversary of ex-Bears receiver Muhsin Muhammad telling Sports Illustrated that Chicago \"is where receivers go to die.\"\n• The rise of Commanders QB Sam Howell\n• Claypool adds to Bears' legacy of issues\n• Rookie QB Richardson's poise key for Colts\n• Bills offense chasing history\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\nSecond-year general manager Ryan Poles tried to change that narrative. He orchestrated a blockbuster trade in March, sending the No. 1 overall pick to the Carolina Panthers for a package that included DJ Moore, a true No. 1 receiver who's 26 and is being looked at to expedite the development of 24-year-old quarterback Justin Fields.\nBut as the Bears prepare for Thursday's rematch with the Commanders (8:15 p.m. ET, Prime Video), they rank 24th in passing yards (186.3 per game) after ranking last in 2022 (130.5). Moore is doing his part, ranking 14th at 75.3 receiving yards per game, but Mooney has eight catches total and Claypool's future in Chicago is in doubt.\nSeveral Bears receivers said they're aware of Muhammad's quote, and they believe the current unit could help change that perception. But history doesn't support their optimism. The Bears have had one first-team All-Pro receiver in the past 15 years in Brandon Marshall, and they've been unable to attract elite free agents because of a lack of quarterback consistency (18 starting QBs in the past 15 years) and a lack of success, with their last playoff win coming in 2011. One player agent said free agents take a hard look at who will be passing them the ball before signing.\n\"When you're talking about [wide receiver], it had been a huge issue for us because of the lack of stability at the most important position on the field,\" said Josh Lucas, the Bears' director of player personnel from 2015 to '22. \"We always knew as long as we didn't have an attractive quarterback that wide receivers wanted to come play with, we would be up against the eight ball.\"\nThe Bears acquired Claypool in a trade deadline move on Nov. 1, 2022, and he didn't come cheap. Chicago sent its second-round pick, which proved to be No. 32 overall -- essentially a first-rounder -- because Miami's first-rounder was stripped by a sanction.\nClaypool caught 18 passes for 191 yards and one score over 10 games for Chicago. His lackluster effort, especially when it came to blocking, was addressed by coach Matt Eberflus after a Week 2 loss. And Claypool's frustration was evident Friday when he said he didn't think he was being put in the best position to showcase his skill set. Two days later, he was a healthy scratch, although Eberflus said what Claypool said didn't have anything to do with him being inactive. He's also being asked not to attend team activities this week.\n\"We'll see where it goes from there,\" Eberflus said Monday. \"Ryan handles all those things, all those trades and transactions, and we'll see where it goes.\"\nConversely, Moore has been what the Bears needed. He had eight receptions for 131 yards and a touchdown Sunday to boost his season numbers to 19 catches, 301 yards and 2 TDs. He now has two games topping 100 receiving yards, becoming the first Bears receiver to do so in the first four weeks since Allen Robinson in 2020.\nMarshall said the connection between Fields and Moore reminds him of what he had with Jay Cutler.\n\"They have the chemistry already,\" Marshall said. \"You saw them in training camp.\"\nIf there was a silver lining Sunday for Chicago, it's that the offense showed some progress, especially Fields, who had his first 300-yard-passing game (335) and his first game with four passing touchdowns. The Bears entered Week 4 ranked 29th in yards per game at 250 and 26th in scoring at 15.7, and they gained 471 yards and scored 28. But that improvement did come against a Broncos team that yielded 70 points the previous week to the Miami Dolphins, and it did come in a 31-28 loss.\n\"When you're 0-4, no one's done the job well enough,\" Eberflus said. \"That's just facts.\n\"It's a results business, and we have to do a better job collectively as a group.\"\nWithout Claypool, there will be pressure on Mooney to regain his 2021 form, when he caught 81 passes for 1,055 yards and four TDs. But optimism about a Fields-Mooney connection faded last season when he caught 40 passes for 493 yards and two scores.\nThat's one of the reasons Mooney wanted to revisit the play vs. Washington: to learn from his mistakes. He was optimistic the addition of Moore would allow this group to rehabilitate the image of the Bears' receiving corps, but that was before the Claypool saga.\n\"I don't believe ... where it's like, 'Oh my goodness, this team is cursed,''' Marshall said in reference to Muhammad's quote. \"I just believe that you go out there and do your job.\"\nClaypool's absence also means receivers such as rookie Tyler Scott will have to contribute sooner than expected.\n\"I definitely heard [Muhammad's quote],\" Scott said. \"I don't put too much stock into it. That's how he felt, and that's his opinion.\n\"At the end of the day, each generation comes and everybody has a new opportunity. That's how I see it. Why can't you change that stigma or culture that Chicago may have, or that he felt that they had?\"\nMarshall and Alshon Jeffery were the Bears' most recent Pro Bowl receivers in 2013. In the nine seasons since, Chicago receivers have ranked 28th in targets, 31st in receiving yards and 30th in first-down receptions, and they are tied for 28th in receiving touchdowns.\nSince the start of modern NFL free agency in 1993, the Bears' biggest free agent acquisition at wide receiver was Robinson in 2018. Like Moore, Marshall had come via trade, and the Bears drafted Jeffery.\nLucas said the timing was perfect to sign Robinson. Mitch Trubisky, whom the Bears traded up to take at No. 2 overall, was entering his second season and Matt Nagy was taking over as head coach. Nagy had spent the previous 10 seasons under Andy Reid in Philadelphia and Kansas City.\nRobinson thrived with 1,147 yards and seven touchdowns in 2019 and 1,250 yards and six TDs the following year. But Trubisky left as a free agent for the Buffalo Bills in 2021, and Robinson grew unhappy over his contract situation and left as a free agent for the Los Angeles Rams last season.\nThe Bears are hoping Fields can develop into the type of quarterback who can attract free agents, but there's another scenario in which Fields' future may lie elsewhere. It's possible the Bears could land the No. 1 overall pick for the second year in a row. Chicago not only has its No. 1 pick, but also Carolina's. The Bears and Panthers are the only 0-4 teams in the NFL.\nIf that happens, the Bears would be in position to draft the overwhelming choice for the top pick in USC quarterback Caleb Williams, which would put Fields on the trading block.\nAnd while Williams might help attract free agents, it would mean another spin on the QB revolving door. Muhammad's frustration with the Bears was linked to the quarterback carousel he dealt with over three seasons (2005-07), having played with Kyle Orton, Rex Grossman, Brian Griese and Jeff Blake. That played a role in Muhammad's output taking a step back from the first nine years of his career in Carolina, where he earned first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors.\n\"We'd have to take a hard look at who's playing quarterback for them before signing with Chicago,\" one agent told ESPN. \"Few receivers can truly produce no matter [who's throwing them the ball], and even then there's no guarantee that will continue if the quarterback situation isn't good.\n\"I wouldn't be doing my job if I got them to a place where their career could fall off a cliff.\"\nESPN Jets reporter Rich Cimini contributed to this report."}
{"title": "WNBA Finals predictions: Can Aces repeat or will Liberty win first title?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:53:43", "text": "Seven of 18 WNBA Finals have gone the distance since the best-of-five format started in 2005. With the top two seeds and preseason favorites playing for the 2023 WNBA championship, will we see an eighth rendition of a winner-take-all Game 5 when the Las Vegas Aces face the New York Liberty?\nWe couldn't ask for a better setup, with a matchup of superstars in their primes -- Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson and New York's Breanna Stewart -- as two teams with the top talent and what appears to be the best chemistry meet. The Finals will begin Sunday in Las Vegas at 3 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN App.\nThe most recent five-game WNBA Finals was in 2019, when the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun. That was a matchup of the top two teams in the standings, as was the case in 2016 and 2017, when the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx went the distance and alternated in taking home the trophy.\nThis season, the Liberty beat the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup final, while the teams split their four regular-season meetings. They played four times in August, so those games are still fresh in their minds.\nAlmost anywhere you look in this series, you'll see a No. 1 pick or an MVP or a statistical leader -- or someone who is all three.\nBoth coaches are former WNBA players; Las Vegas' Becky Hammon led the Aces to the league title last year, while New York's Sandy Brondello guided the Phoenix Mercury to the 2014 championship.\nThe fan bases come at this from a different perspective. The Aces' franchise dates to the start of the WNBA in 1997 as the Utah Starzz, but their time in Las Vegas has been short and successful. They moved from San Antonio to the Strip in 2018, and they are appearing in the Finals for the third time.\nNew York, on the other hand, is the only still-existing original WNBA franchise that has not won a title. While the Liberty players -- none of whom has been with the team since before 2019 -- might not really feel that historical weight, the longtime Liberty fans do.\nSo which superteam will be the 2023 champion? ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel preview the Finals.\nVoepel: Stewart's shooting woes have been a surprise. She was at 46.5% overall and 35.5% from behind the arc in the regular season. In the Liberty's six playoff games, those percentages have dropped to 35.6 and 20.7. Of course, if she got a lot of her misses out of the way before the Finals, that's good news for the Liberty.\nPhilippou: Having covered the Liberty-Sun series in person, New York seemed to develop grit in real time to overcome a 0-1 deficit versus an uber-tough Connecticut squad and win three straight games, including two at Mohegan Sun Arena. Different people stepped up in different moments for the Liberty, but for the most part, they stayed poised to close out such a competitive series in four games.\nI am surprised the Liberty's bench hasn't seen more minutes in the playoffs, since their depth seemed to be an advantage when considering New York as a contender earlier this season. Does that change against the Aces? Kayla Thornton's toughness and energy can turn around a game, as can Marine Johannes' shooting, and Stefanie Dolson adds post depth against a team that doesn't have a ton of it. Johannes had a stellar outing versus the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup championship, but she has played only 42 minutes this postseason.\nPelton: In addition to seconding what Alexa said, I agree Stewart's postseason slump has been a surprise. When the Seattle Storm lost to Las Vegas in last year's semifinals, it was the first time a healthy Stewart had been knocked out of the playoffs since 2017. And even then, Stewart set a playoff record with 42 points in the final game of a hard-fought series. Going back to UConn, and including EuroLeague competition, Stewart has almost always been at her best when the stakes are the highest. They don't come much higher than in this series.\nPhilippou: Yes, the Finals are a whole new series, but those games -- particularly the August ones -- showed us a lot about how these teams match up. That said, I expect Wilson to play closer to how she did Aug. 28 against the Liberty (23 points) than say how she fared Aug. 6, when she tallied nine points on 2-for-14 shooting and tweeted, \"I doubt I'll ever shoot 2-14 again I pray I don't lol.\" Since then, she has shot below 40% just once, and she has been playing on another level over the past two months or so. The Liberty have excellent defenders in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, but they'll still have their hands full trying to slow down Wilson.\nVoepel: The Aces' 98-81 victory over the Liberty on June 29 doesn't have much bearing on this series, as Candace Parker was still playing for the Aces, and Jones wasn't quite in the playing form she is now. The other four matchups, all in August, are likely indicative of what we will see in the Finals. The Aces didn't play well in their first game in Brooklyn nor in the Commissioner's Cup final in Las Vegas. Those will be games the Aces will review in preparation because they were far from their best in both.\nThe Aces and Liberty split their regular-season series, but New York beat Las Vegas in their Aug. 15 Commissioner's Cup championship game, which doesn't count toward WNBA standings or statistics. While the Aces are 2-3 against New York, they went 37-4 against the rest of the league, and only the Liberty had multiple wins against Las Vegas, per ESPN Stats & Information.\nPelton: It's interesting that head-to-head results haven't been particularly predictive of Finals results. Since the WNBA went to a single playoff table in 2016, and not including the shortened 2020 Wubble season, teams that won the regular-season series have gone just 2-4 in the Finals. And both of those winners, the 2018 Storm and last year's Aces, also had home-court advantage in the Finals. However, we've never seen teams play each other this often before the Finals. All of those previous head-to-head series were three games rather than the five times Las Vegas and New York have already met this year.\nPelton: Given the firepower on both sides, I think it's more about which team can consistently get stops. New York was 15-0 in the regular season (and 1-0 so far in the playoffs) when holding opponents to 95 points per 100 possessions or fewer. One of those games was the Aug. 6 blowout win over Las Vegas that represented the Aces' worst offensive performance of the season in terms of points per possession -- and the Liberty's best on defense.\nPhilippou: Defensively, for the reasons Pelton stated, but also because if you ask both Hammon and Brondello, they'd say defense wins championships. Not just by the pure nature of getting stops and keeping an opponent off the scoreboard, but for these two teams in particular, defense (and defensive rebounding) fuels offense on the other end, especially in transition.\nThe Aces have had the best defensive rating in both the regular season and playoffs, but they allowed the Liberty to score at least 80 points in all of their previous meetings except one -- Aug. 17, the only time Las Vegas beat New York in their four matchups that month.\nTop-seeded Las Vegas and No. 2 seed New York dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, they ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nVoepel: The Aces have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Wilson, but she has given much praise to Kiah Stokes as the true anchor of Las Vegas' defense. The Aces' Jackie Young is one of the league's best defensive guards and at 6 feet tall actually can take on just about anyone. Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark is also a versatile defender.\nIt makes sense to say defense will prevail in this series, for all the reasons Alexa and Kevin point out. Still, let's add this: The Aces can be like a runaway train on offense, and that can take over games. The Aces won playoff games scoring 97 points and 64 points, which shows how effective they can be on both ends of the court.\nPhilippou: Jones' emergence into her MVP-level self is arguably the single biggest development that has catapulted this Liberty team into a contender. In the postseason, she has had six double-doubles in as many games; and in the second half alone of Game 4 in the semifinals, Jones came up with 20 points and eight rebounds.\nGoing up against the Mystics' and Sun's frontcourts is different than facing that of the Aces' (especially with Wilson being unstoppable as of late). But if Jones can play like she did in New York's August meetings versus Las Vegas, the Liberty are much better positioned to win.\nAnother X factor is Liberty forward Betnijah Laney, who has scored at least 19 points in all but one of New York's postseason games and will be critical to helping contain the Aces' high-powered guards.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nVoepel: Jones is the biggest X factor overall in the series. The biggest for Las Vegas is Kelsey Plum's 3-point shooting, because that can really fuel the Aces. Plum averaged 2.4 3s per game and shot 38.9% from behind the arc in the regular season; during the Aces' five playoff games, she was at 3.2 and 42.1%. Plum, Young and Chelsea Gray all can do damage from long range, but if Plum gets in a groove, it makes Las Vegas' offense all the harder to stop.\nPelton: Stokes. Over the course of the season, as well as the playoffs, the Aces' starting lineup with Stokes in place of the injured Parker -- the group that led Las Vegas to last year's title -- has remained dominant.\nHowever, that hasn't been the case against the Liberty. In 45 minutes across the five meetings, the Aces were outscored by 19 points with their starting five on the court. Although Hammon can always go small with Clark in Stokes' place, not being able to keep Stokes on the court will leave Las Vegas painfully thin.\nPhilippou: Liberty in 5. I went back and forth and wouldn't be shocked to be proved wrong. But at the end of the day, it's hard to ignore how much the Liberty dominated the Aces in their most recent meetings in August. Plus, New York had a much tougher road to the championship series, and being battle-tested will pay off. Jones won MVP of the Commissioner's Cup championship game thanks to her dominance in the paint on both ends and on the glass, and I project her to take home Finals MVP should the Liberty win.\nVoepel: Aces in 5. This feels like the 2016 and 2017 Lynx-Sparks Finals, when there was such a good case for both teams to win both years. They split, with the Sparks winning in 2016 and the Lynx in 2017. The Sparks won 2016's Game 5 on Minnesota's home court, which is so hard to do in the clinching game of a playoff series. Then the Lynx won in Minneapolis in 2017's Game 5 -- although at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena, because Target Center was being refurbished. The WNBA's most recent Finals Game 5 was in 2019, when Washington beat Connecticut on the Mystics' home court.\nIt seems like this year, the Aces -- who celebrated their 2022 title in Connecticut -- might win it at home.\nPelton: Liberty in 4. That's not a reflection on how close the series might be, but lower-seeded teams that have won the Finals in the best-of-five era have been more likely to close out at home than win a Game 5 on the road. If Parker were healthy, I'd be inclined to pick Las Vegas. But New York has been the (slightly) better team since the All-Star break, and I don't expect Stewart's shooting slump to carry over into the Finals.\nRamona Shelburne: Aces in 5. Las Vegas misses Parker, and this matchup is going to be difficult. But the Aces are the defending champs until someone takes the title from them. You've got to knock them off, and that's difficult over a best-of-five series."}

Numerous outings to the local Trader Joe's have resulted in an abundance of harvest-themed purchases. And while the bouquet of sunflowers on my desk looks beautiful and the pumpkin yogurt tasted surprisingly good... I want the real thing.\nI want to hear fall leaves crunch under a pair of cute boots. I want to sip apple cider and not sweat. And I really want the Bears to not embarrass themselves Thursday night. None of those things will happen, however, without taking action. I need to -- on my own -- venture outside of the Bristol bubble and discover all of the bucolic hiking trails and quaint roadside stands. And the Bears, well, they need to do a whole lot but should probably start with letting Justin Fields use his legs.\nThe same is true in fantasy. We're a month into the 2023 experiment and, speaking for myself, it has felt more like raking the lawn than snacking on pumpkin seeds. We have reached a point of transition. More than a few hot summer takes have begun to chill.\nThe emergence of new patterns and facts requires us to confront our feelings about what we thought was going to happen and instead get real about what is actually going on. Whether that means benching Joe Burrow (QB31) or getting behind Evan Engram (TE4); it's time to shed what isn't working and adventure toward something different. There's no guaranteeing these adjustments will lead to victorious gains, but neither will nervously standing still.\nSo, while that maple chai-scented room diffuser might smell great now, you're going to need something stronger to get you through the winter.\nAnthony Richardson, QB, Indianapolis Colts: Richardson is showing zero anxiety. This man is fearlessly running -- literally and figuratively -- toward his destiny. Even while in the grasp of Aaron Freaking Donald, Richardson is advancing the ball. His maturation as a passer might still be in its beginning stages, but the rookie has, thus far, recorded the fifth-highest pressured completion percentage (63.6%). That shows guts and intelligence. Richardson's physical tools are successfully translating to the NFL while manifesting a boon for fantasy investors.\nCongrats to all of those who believed from the jump because Richardson is currently the QB2 in fantasy points per game. That's what happens when a wildly gifted mobile passer is not only allowed but even encouraged to lean into his talent as a rusher. Richardson has executed 14 designed runs in three games, which includes all four of his touchdowns. (Can someone please forward this to Luke Getsy?) As a result, he has managed more fantasy points per game as a runner (12.38) than Joe Mixon, Rachaad White or Alexander Mattison. Additionally, his 29.60 fantasy points from Week 4 was the third-highest total by any QB this season (and 11 completions, tied for the fewest by any signal-caller in a full game so far this year).\nRichardson will have to shift some of his focus from the ground to the air versus the Titans on Sunday. Tennessee has allowed a completion percentage of nearly 71% and an average exceeding 241 passing yards (10th-most) per week to opposing quarterbacks. Mike Vrabel's gritty defensive front also managed to hold Deshaun Watson (the only dual-threat QB the team has faced, save a compromised Joe Burrow) to 16 rushing yards. It figures to be a close battle (+/- 1) but my money is on Richardson's continued ascent. He's a top-five fantasy play in Week 5.\nDe'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins: While we're on the topic of stocks rising ... holy heck, welcome to the NFL, De'Von Achane! The third-round selection out of Texas A&M followed up his 233-yard and four-TD effort in Week 3 by blazing his way to another 120 yards and two scores in Week 4. So, is this a fluke? Or is Achane the real deal?\nI'm leaning toward the latter. How does that genie fit back in the bottle? Achane's snap percentage has increased with each effort (0% - 8% - 42% - 66%). Meanwhile, Raheem Mostert's playing time has decreased since sharing the backfield with the explosive rookie (74% - 51% - 41%). The Dolphins -- like the rest of the modern NFL -- figure to go RBBC. However, Achane is proving to be the more effective rusher. His 11.4 yards per carry is as absurd as it is unsustainable. However, his 2.8 yards after contact per rush also ranks among the top three at the position.\nYou can't sit this guy. Not now. And certainly not as an 11-point favorite versus a reeling Giants squad that gave up 5.3 YPC to Seattle on Monday night. Achane has youth, juice and upside. He also has managed double-digit touches in back-to-back efforts. Consider the burgeoning star a top-12 fantasy RB this Sunday.\nMiles Sanders, RB, Carolina Panthers: If Miami's backfield is Fast & Furious, then Carolina's is giving Radiator Springs vibes. Sanders entered Week 4 with a groin injury, and although his effort deserves snaps, his output was worrisome. The Philly transplant managed a meager 19 rushing yards on 13 carries. While the aforementioned ailment certainly contributed to the vet's inefficiency, his rushing numbers have steadily decreased since the season opener. Sanders recorded 72 rushing yards in Week 1, but then a total of just 86 over his next three contests. Additionally, his 2.9 yards per carry ranks 37th among 44 qualifiers.\nIf there is a silver lining, it's Sanders' work in the passing game. Bryce Young is checking down on the regular. As a result, Sanders ranks third in team targets (23) and receptions (15), placing him among the top five at the position in both of those categories. But this offense has no juice. Between an unfavorable game script and Chuba Hubbard's pesky presence, Sanders is shaping up to be TD-dependent with little to no upside. He figures to further languish on the RB2/RB3 bubble when he takes on an improved (and rested) Lions defense in Week 5.\nMichael Wilson, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Meaningful impacts are hard to come by at the next level. Lord knows I'm still trying to make a positive one on my mother-in-law. Wilson, however, has delighted thus far in his pro campaign.\nThe Stanford alum has demonstrated enticing chemistry with Josh Dobbs, recording 50-plus receiving yards in three consecutive efforts. That stat becomes more impressive when noting that he's just one of 10 wideouts to accomplish such a feat. Wilson has additionally managed a top-15 aDOT (13.5 yards) along with the highest catch rate (88%) in the league. Furthermore, the rookie has outsnapped Rondale Moore in back-to-back games and managed to out-target the vet in his 7-76-0 effort at San Francisco this past Sunday. That arrow is pointing up, friends.\nA player with plus size and strength, Wilson is on his way to emerging as the ideal complement to Marquise Brown. It might not happen this week. And he'll still be saddled by Dobbs. Although with injuries mounting and byes upon us, now is the time to stash a rising star like Wilson. He's worth a speculative flex versus a Bengals defense that has allowed the ninth-most opponent yards per game (364.3).\nJordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings: High expectations often lead to disappointment. So does putting up a bagel on any given Sunday. Enter Addison. The 2021 Biletnikoff Award winner was the first rookie off of most fantasy draft boards. Touchdowns over his first two starts appeared to validate the preseason hype. But all that good juju came to a screeching halt when the 21-year-old failed to convert on his lone target in Week 4. Was it the result of uncharacteristic quarterback play and game flow? Probably. We still need to address the facts and recalibrate our feelings, though.\nAddison's 13.4% target share ranks third on his team (just ahead of Mattison's 12.1%) and 70th among wide receivers. His above average aDOT (12.9) and his efficiency in the red area have buoyed his fantasy numbers. That kind of usage screams boom/bust. The reality of Addison's situation has been tempered by the Vikings' pass-heavy game scripts. When Kirk Cousins puts the ball in the air 40-plus times, Addison is likely to draw at least five looks. Makes easy sense, right? That is not, however, something we can rely on.\nConsider Week 4 the wake-up call. That doesn't mean Addison is a cut candidate. Definitely not while we're weaving through bye weeks and subbing players in and out of IR spots. It does, however, mean thinking about Addison (at least for the moment) as more of an upside flex than an automatic WR3. He's a top-40 FF WR option in what's projected to be a high-scoring game (53.0) versus the Chiefs.\nDalton Schultz, TE, Houston Texans: Schultz has been quiet because his young QB hasn't needed a binky. C.J. Stroud doesn't mind letting it rip, averaging 8.0 yards per attempt (QB3) while registering the sixth-most air yards (953) on the season. From 20 yards out, however, the former Cowboy is proving to be his young QB's bestie.\nSchultz is tied for first in team red zone looks (31% RZ target share) and leads the Texans' offense in end zone opportunities (38% EZ target share). From a positional point of view, His four red zone targets -- as well as this three end zone looks -- is tied for fourth among tight ends.\nIs this chasing touchdowns? Absolutely. Do I like to do it? No, it feels dirty. But some of us -- I'm looking at you, Kyle Pitts and Darren Waller investors -- need to light a three-wicked Yankee candle and conjure up some fantasy goodness. The manifesting figures to continue at Atlanta, as the Falcons have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. I'm optimistically forecasting four grabs, 41 yards and a tuddy for Schultz.\nTyler Conklin, TE, New York Jets: As Travis Kelce has consistently reminded us, knowing not just how but when to shoot your shot is key. Conklin has been on my radar since Zach Wilson took over as the Jets' starter. It wasn't until the CMU product finished second in team targets versus the Chiefs, however, that I considered leaning into his streaming potential.\nConklin delivered a smattering of top-12 fantasy finishes over 2022, although most of his highs came without Wilson at the helm. Whatever was lacking between the two last year appears to have dissolved this go-round. Conklin ranks third on the team in offensive play percentage (76.2%) and second in team targets (17). He has managed 5-plus looks in each game over the past three weeks. Although those numbers are far from astonishing, only eight tight ends have managed the same or better. Welcome (again) to the TE hellscape.\nAvailable in over 90% of ESPN fantasy leagues, Conklin offers sneaky sleeper appeal in Week 5. He'll face a bruised and battered Broncos defense that has coaxed production out even the most broken offenses. Denver has given up the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, including a stunning 7-85-2 stat line to Cole Kmet in Week 4.\nI can't promise it will be pretty. But I know it's something different. Consider Conklin this week's newest borderline TE1.\nFollow Liz on social @LizLoza_FF"}

But Lynch bluntly said he isn't the right person to ask due to his relationship with both parties.\nA post shared by ESPN (@espn)\nCandidly, Lynch said he respects Wilson as a player and a teammate.\n\"I'll take Russ and I'll put him at quarterback and I'll rock with him because I've done that,\" he said.\nBut, according to Lynch, anything he says might be taken with malice because of the fallout from the goal-line interception Wilson threw in Super Bowl XLIX that led to the Seahawks' 28-24 defeat to the New England Patriots and contributed to Wilson's eventual departure for the Denver Broncos. In terms of a relationship, Lynch said, he and Wilson didn't have one off the field.\n\"Can't pick up the phone or call old boy or nothing,\" Lynch said.\nThe aftermath of a game against the Tennessee Titans in 2013 stood out to Lynch when reflecting on his relationship with Wilson.\nLynch said the Titans didn't have a good secondary at the time; therefore, the plan was to exploit the pass defense. Wilson didn't have the game that he wanted, throwing for 257 yards and no touchdowns.\nAccording to Lynch, he asked the team's player personnel staff for Wilson's number to offer support. The staff member promised to look into it and later called Lynch back to see if he got a call from Wilson. Lynch responded that he hadn't spoken with Wilson, but he had received a phone call with caller ID blocked.\n\"I don't know how or why [it was blocked], but I just know I got a call from a blocked number,\" Lynch said.\nLynch and Wilson eventually spoke, but the conversation didn't go the way Lynch expected. He said he tried to let Wilson know he \"had his back,\" but Wilson's response surprised Lynch.\n\"Considering that [we're] on the same team, going for the same goal and this is how you chose to respond to me,\" he recalled. \"It was more so like, maybe you don't understand what I'm saying?\"\nLater in the podcast, Lynch cited preferential treatment from Carroll to Wilson as a reason for tension within the team. \"You're kind of putting him on a pedestal or outside the box,\" Lynch said. \"And it's like he doesn't have to be held accountable to the same s--- that we do.\"\nLynch and Wilson were teammates in Seattle for four full seasons, winning Super Bowl XLVIII. Lynch briefly returned to the Seahawks in 2019 for one game.\nWilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 after 10 years with the Seahawks."}
{"title": "Champions League talking points: Best player so far, how to save Man Utd", "date": "2023-10-05 12:38:50", "text": "Nedum Onuoha explains why he isn't worried that Manchester City's defense has had trouble holding teams scoreless. (1:38)\nThe 2023-24 Champions League group stage is underway, and matchday two is in the books with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Barcelona the only teams to maintain a 100% record. After a thrilling round of games, we asked our writers Gab Marcotti, Rob Dawson and Sam Marsden to answer some of our burning questions.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n- Guardiola passes Sir Alex Ferguson for UCL wins\nManchester United. Two games, two defeats, and they're already struggling to qualify for the Round of 16. They've scored five goals in games against Bayern Munich and Galatasaray but the way they've defended has been appalling, leaking seven goals in 180 minutes of football. They conceded three at home against Galatasaray but it could have been even worse. Mauro Icardi missed a penalty after Casemiro had been sent off, and also had a good chance in stoppage-time with the score already at 3-2. It's not the first time in recent history that United have been in trouble in the group stage, going out before the knockouts in both 2015-16 and 2020-21. -- Dawson\nFive teams are on zero points, but obviously Manchester United stand out, mainly because of the recurring psychodrama in the background (Antony, the Glazers, Jadon Sancho, half the starting back four out, etc.) and their horrible league form as well. I'd throw in Paris Saint-Germain as well, simply because of the manner of the 4-1 defeat at Newcastle United, the way the club can be a zoo, and the fact that head coach Luis Enrique is, well, different. And if I'm Arsenal, I'm not taking things for granted either. Sevilla home and away next can be very tricky. -- Marcotti\nIt's Man United, isn't it?! But to add some variety, there is also pressure on Luis Enrique and PSG. It's not just that they lost to Newcastle, it's that they were beaten 4-1. Throw in the fact they are in the toughest group in the competition and now have a double-header coming up against AC Milan and it's not hard to imagine them failing to make it into the knockout rounds. Three draws and a defeat in seven Ligue 1 games show this is not just a European issue, either. The post-Lionel Messi and Neymar years, built around Kylian Mbappé and French brilliance, were not supposed to be so rocky so soon. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley and Alejandro Moreno assess another dismal defeat for Man United in the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Galatasaray.\nFC Copenhagen. They've never been past the group stage, but they've done enough in the opening two games to show they've got a chance this time. They were 2-0 up against Galatasaray in Istanbul with four minutes to go, and were only pegged back to 2-2 after going down to 10 men; then they took the lead at home against Bayern before narrowly losing 2-1. Their fate in Group A will be decided by back-to-back games against Manchester United, and with Erik ten Hag's team not playing well, the Danish champions could spring a surprise. -- Dawson\nLet's face it, nobody in Group F (Newcastle, PSG, AC Milan and Dortmund), which is wide open, is an underdog. Nor are Lens, frankly. So I'm going to suggest Feyenoord. I love the fact that head coach Arne Slot decided to stick around and give it a go after winning the Eredivisie title, rather than chasing coin elsewhere like so many of his colleagues would have done. They gave Atletico Madrid a real fright away, and can do the same to others. -- Marcotti\nMaybe underdog is pushing it, but Real Sociedad were in pot four in the draw so should technically be the worst the team in their group. I know the science to the pots means that isn't necessarily the case but Internazionale and Benfica would still have been the two teams expected to progress. Instead, La Real sit top after two games thanks to a draw against the Italians and Tuesday's 2-0 win at FC Salzburg. Take Kubo and Brais Méndez are great fun to watch, and they have a homegrown spine that makes it easy to root for them. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley lays into the performance of PSG's Kylian Mbappe following their thumping 4-1 defeat to Newcastle United in the Champions League.\nManchester United have been rubbish in the Champions League but £72 million striker Rasmus Hojlund has, at least, been a positive. The 20-year-old became the youngest player to score in his first two Champions League games since Erling Haaland when he found the net against Galatasaray after opening his United account on matchday one against Bayern. His first against Galatasaray was a thumping header from Marcus Rashford's cross, and his second was about his pace and finishing ability after racing away from the halfway line. Hojlund is under immense pressure to perform as United's central striker and, so far, he's handling it well. -- Dawson\nAm I allowed to say Newcastle defender Dan Burn? What, you want somebody more glamorous? I had zero expectations for Icardi, but he came up huge for Galatasaray last season and it's continuing this year. Some love for Atletico striker Álvaro Morata too, please. Mendez has been really impressive for Real Sociedad, and Man City's Julián Álvarez gets better every time I see him play. -- Marcotti\nIt's hard to focus on one player after just two games, but I'll go with Alvarez. He was the star in Manchester City's win over Red Star Belgrade and then came off the bench to down RB Leipzig on Wednesday. He's making it impossible for City boss Pep Guardiola to leave him out when the big games come around. A shout out for João Félix, too, who has been good in both of Barcelona's games so far, and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham. Even if we expected him to be good, we did not imagine him having this impact so soon, with important goals in wins over Union Berlin and Napoli. -- Marsden\nAle Moreno heaps praise on Jude Bellingham following Real Madrid's Champions League win over Napoli.\nThey need to defend better. Injuries, particularly at the back, have been a problem this season, but Lisandro Martínez, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are likely to miss the rest of the group-stage games and manager Ten Hag has to find a way of improving with the players he's got available. One easy fix is to move Sofyan Amrabat from a makeshift left-back into midfield to give Casemiro some help. Casemiro will have to serve a suspension after his red card against Galatasaray, but having him alongside Amrabat once the Brazilian is back will make United far more robust in the middle of the pitch. -- Dawson\nIt's kinda two different questions as I see it, in the sense they don't need to hit their stride to get out of the group. Obviously, they need to take four of six points in the double-header against Copenhagen and avoid defeat in Istanbul. Then, on matchday six, they play Bayern, who will probably have qualified by then and may play the C-team. So that's eight points they can get without being particularly good. And that might be enough.\nHow do they actually get good? Well, that's a far more complicated question. I'm not sure their injured guys will be back in time to affect this group stage, Casemiro is now suspended, Antony is anyone's guess. There's enough there that Bruno Fernandes and Rashford can carry them at times (not all the time as we've seen) but there's a reason why they've only won three games all season (I'm not counting the win over Palace in the Carabao Cup). And, lest we forget, Wolverhampton Wanderers were robbed after outplaying them for long stretches, and United they had to come from two goals down to beat Nottingham Forest, who played the last 23 minutes with 10 men. Meanwhile, against Burnley, they were thoroughly outplayed and it took a moment of magic from Bruno (and ... wait for it ... Jonny Freaking Evans!) to get the three points. Yeah, it's bad, it's really bad. -- Marcotti\nAs Gab points out, the two are not mutually exclusive. United are now in a situation where they need to turn to an old football cliche and take things game by game. In that sense, they have a nice fixture list. Back-to-back matches against Copenhagen, who have proven tough opponents against Galatasaray and Bayern, give them a chance to revive their European hopes. Winning those fixtures would set up a huge game in Turkey against Galatasaray. Beyond that, they need to get players back in their natural positions (which is not easy with their list of absentees, but Amrabat into midfield would be a start) and build around their best players, who at the moment are Bruno and Hojlund. The latter's goal-scoring ability could help lift the mood around the team, but it looks bleak at the moment. -- Marsden"}
{"title": "Best, worst moments of Xavi's 100 games as Barcelona manager", "date": "2023-10-05 12:38:50", "text": "There have been ups and downs along the way, but it's indisputable that Barcelona are in a better place now than they were when they appointed Xavi Hernandez, as the coach took charge of his 100th game on Wednesday night against Porto in the Champions League.\nXavi, 43, replaced Ronald Koeman in November 2021 just months after Lionel Messi had left Barça, with the club in financial crisis, ninth in LaLiga and on the verge of elimination from the Champions League. Almost two years on, the Catalan side are reigning LaLiga champions, outplayed bitter rivals Real Madrid to win the Spanish Super Cup earlier this year and have hopes of regaining their status among Europe's biggest sides.\nThe path back to the summit has not always been straightforward, especially in the Champions League. Barça have been knocked out in the group stage in back-to-back campaigns and after dropping into the Europa League as a consequence, have also failed to make it past the quarterfinal stage of the continent's secondary competition.\nOverall, though, the highs outweigh the lows. There have been two trophies -- including a first LaLiga title since 2019 -- 63 victories from 100 games and a squad overhaul that's seen the focus switch back to La Masia, the club's famous academy. Gavi (19), Lamine Yamal (16), Alejandro Balde (19), Pedri (20) and Fermín López (20) are five players aged 20 or under getting regular minutes under Xavi, who has also added premium, top-flight experience in the form of Robert Lewandowski and Ilkay Gündogan.\nIncredibly, just three players remain from the starting XI in Xavi's first game, a 1-0 win over Espanyol on Nov. 20, 2021: goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen, plus midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Gavi. Meanwhile Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba are among the heavyweights who have left as Xavi managed to separate his friendships with his former teammates from the storied club's sporting issues.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nThe 21-man squad for the current season -- the 19 players registered for the first team plus youngsters Lamine and Fermín -- features 11 Xavi signings, plus various players who were in the B team or youth teams at the time when he took over. It's a combination which Xavi, who recently signed a new contract until 2025, feels is fuelling Barça's push for trophies.\n\"What I would highlight is the mix we have achieved between veterans and youngsters and the human quality of the players in the squad,\" he told ESPN as he looked ahead to his 100th game in charge. \"It is not easy to create the atmosphere we have in the dressing room at the moment.\"\n(With reporting by Jordi Blanco)\nThe games Xavi remembers most fondly are the ones that yielded trophies. The first came via a 3-1 win over Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup final in January this year.\n\"That was the best game, absolutely no doubt,\" Xavi said. \"I have said it several times and I stand by it. I go for that game because of the performance, because you saw how we wanted to play and because it was our first trophy. Also, because of who it was against. After that day, the players believed in everything we wanted to do.\"\nThe LaLiga title followed a few months later. After Franck Kessié's dramatic late winner in the Clásico against Madrid, Barça sealed top spot with a 4-2 win away against Espanyol, prompting angry home supporters to chase the Blaugrana players off the pitch as they celebrated a first domestic championship in four years.\n\"Winning the league will always be unforgettable,\" Xavi added. \"We finally did it. It had been our main objective since we took on the job. We showed that we could do it -- and against our city rival as well. We produced one of our best performances of the season.\"\nSam Marsden explains why Joao Felix has made an instant impact at Barca, after struggling at Atletico Madrid and Chelsea.\nWhile there were no trophies in 2021-22, there were memorable moments as Barça climbed the table to secure Champions League qualification -- something that was far from guaranteed when Xavi took the job. The midseason signings of Ferran Torres, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Dani Alves and Adama Traoré sparked a revival and produced some scintillating performances between January and March. The 4-2 wins against Atletico Madrid and Napoli stand out, while that run of form going into the international break culminated with a 4-0 over Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in LaLiga.\nThat win prompted Pique to post on social media: \"We're back.\" Pique's comment proved premature as Barça suffered a dip in form after the international break, but those results laid the foundations for a title charge the following campaign -- albeit after a summer in which Lewandowski, Raphinha, Jules Koundé, Andreas Christensen and Kessié arrived after club assets were sold off to fund a splurge on the transfer market.\nThe Super Cup win over Madrid, in which Xavi fielded four midfielders plus Lewandowski and Ousmane Dembélé in attack, provided the squad with the self-belief to go on and win LaLiga, but it was two performances this season that Xavi described as \"the best Barça have played\" during his tenure.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

The way Barça played, with Cancelo stepping into midfield, Felix linking with Lewandowski and quick, one-touch positional play across the pitch \"is the path to follow,\" Xavi said.\nDespite success domestically and impressive wins over 14-time European champions Madrid, Barça have still struggled in Europe. Capitulations in recent years against Roma, Liverpool and Bayern Munich have left their mark, and it is in the Champions League where Xavi's side have suffered their bleakest nights.\nA goalless draw at Camp Nou against Benfica in Xavi's first Champions League game in charge left them with a mountain to climb going to Munich in 2021. Needing a win to get through to the knockout rounds, they capitulated, losing 3-0. Xavi labelled that defeat \"rock bottom\" but it was elimination a year later, when he had been given time to put his mark on the side, that stung more.\n\"The 3-0 loss at home to Bayern last season,\" Xavi told ESPN when asked for the worst game of the 99 he has overseen. \"It was a tough defeat, the worst because it was the night we were knocked out. We either weren't able to or didn't know how to compete in the necessary way.\n\"Bayern have been my toughest opponent. It's always difficult to play against them. And, of course, Madrid. They are always a hard side to face whatever the circumstances because of who they are and because of everything that surrounds a Clásico.\"\nThat Bayern defeat had already been preceded by some disappointing European nights: a 2-0 loss in Munich, a 1-0 defeat to Inter Milan and a 3-3 draw at home to the Italians, which was actually the result which effectively ended Barça's Champions League campaign that season. A Europa League exit followed at the hands of Manchester United, although elimination in the same competition to Eintracht Frankfurt -- when the German team's supporters took over Camp Nou, snapping up over 20,000 tickets in the home end and prompting an internal club investigation -- was arguably more painful.\n\"The problem was we were considered favourites going into it,\" Xavi said of Barça's Europa League struggles. \"I don't think we fully believed that we were playing in that competition. It is hard to compete in a tournament that a lot of Barca fans and people, in general, don't care much about.\"\nThe 4-0 Copa del Rey semifinal reverse to Madrid in April at Camp Nou, after winning the first leg 1-0, was minimised due to the number of players missing for the game and the fact that the LaLiga title was imminent, but it was a result that sewed just a few doubts about whether Barça really were back.\nThere is no letup at Barça and winning one title does not buy you another 100 games in charge. Xavi, who made 767 appearances for the club -- a number only bettered by Lionel Messi -- knows that.\n\"For those that know the club, it's about excellence in everything we do,\" he said in a news conference earlier this year. \"That's why this is the most difficult club in the world. There is no comparison. There is no other club in the world like this, [with that] demand to win playing well. It is very difficult.\n\"We are obliged to win and play well. This is Barça. A 1-0 in the 90th minute is not enough, we know this.\"\nThat lays out what is expected from Xavi over the next two years. Barça must continue to improve aesthetically. They have to be in the running to win LaLiga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup. It is in Europe, though, where Xavi faces his biggest challenge. There will be no excuses if they fail to get out of a Champions League group this season that includes Porto, Royal Antwerp and Shakhtar Donetsk.\nFrom there, there is an element of luck of the draw, but Barça need to show they can at least compete with -- not necessarily beat -- Europe's biggest teams again, as they seek a first Champions League trophy since 2015, back when Xavi was still part of the team's midfield. They are on the path to doing that and are in an infinitely better place than they were when they appointed Xavi, whose only previously managerial experience was in Qatar with Al Sadd, but there are challenges ahead.\nDespite victories over Madrid and winning LaLiga, there is still the nagging feeling that big European performances are needed. And if Barça make it to those games, there are questions for Xavi: Will playing Cancelo and Balde as full-backs leave you too exposed in more open games? Which is his best centre-back pairing? Does he pick Oriol Romeu at the base of the midfield, or simply arrange his best midfielders? A box midfield four or a front three? Who starts on the right wing? Can he get the best out of an ageing Lewandowski?\nThe answers to those questions, and others, will shape his next 100 matches."}
{"title": "Overheard on NBA media day: New-look Bucks, LeBron's understudy and ... a green alien?", "date": "2023-10-05 04:22:45", "text": "Grizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman speaks about the significance of Ja Morant being allowed to travel with the team during his 25-game suspension. (0:55)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season is just weeks away, and as the players and coaches prepare for training camp, our NBA insiders are breaking down some of the biggest things we overheard from this season's media days.\nThe San Antonio Spurs' highly anticipated rookie, Victor Wembanyama, is no stranger to the media as the first overall pick prepares for his first NBA training camp amid expectations he will help lead San Antonio alongside Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson.\nOther teams got to introduce their biggest offseason additions. The Milwaukee Bucks debuted recently acquired seven-time All-Star Damian Lillard alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez.\nThere are still some organizations with serious questions to address heading into the season. The Boston Celtics will face some growing pains with a revamped coaching staff on top of the offseason additions of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. The Memphis Grizzlies, who grabbed media attention for all the wrong reasons last season, will be confronted with questions about navigating Ja Morant's 25-game suspension for conduct detrimental to the league.\nAnd most notably, the Philadelphia 76ers will try to manage the drama surrounding James Harden, who did not attend media day as he continues to seek a trade.\nHere's what players, coaches and teams are talking about as media day kicked off across the league.\nJump to a team:\nBOS | DEN | DET | GS | LAC\nLAL | MEM | MIL | PHI | SA\n\nLike everywhere else around the league, it had a lot of \"first day of school\" energy. There also was a healthy dose of optimism about contending with a roster that includes the reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, a championship coach in Nick Nurse and versatile veteran talent.\nBut the specter of James Harden's absence -- and when or if the disgruntled point guard will return to the team -- hovered over it all.\nIt made for a confusing scene that likely won't get much clearer as the team shifts to Colorado State's campus in Fort Collins, Colorado, for training camp the rest of this week.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey opened his presser by declaring the team needs to be given time to prove it can achieve its lofty expectations. Embiid, meanwhile, questioned an assertion that Milwaukee and Boston had \"surpassed\" the 76ers with their acquisitions of Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday, respectively.\n\"You can do whatever you want off the court,\" Embiid said, \"but you still gotta go out there and put the ball in the hoop. I believe that any team that I'm on, we're always going to have a chance.\"\nNo one had any idea when Harden would return.\nInstead, those questions were met with shrugs or hope that last year's NBA assists leader would return to the fold.\n\"That ain't for me to answer,\" 76ers forward P.J. Tucker said. \"I hope they figure it out soon. But if not, it's going to be what it's going to be.\"\nUnlike the Ben Simmons situation two years ago, there is seemingly no animosity between Harden and his teammates, which is partly why the 76ers believe there's a path to him returning to the court. The fact there's no obvious trade partner for Harden doesn't hurt, either.\nBut it's also clear that, without Harden, the 76ers have little chance of keeping up with the East's elite. It's a task that will be difficult even if he does eventually rejoin Philadelphia's ranks.\n-- Tim Bontemps\n\nLess than a week after being traded for the first time in his 11-year NBA career, reality was still setting in for Damian Lillard, the Milwaukee Buck.\nBut it was easy for him to get excited about his new running mate, two-time MVP and 2021 Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, and all the ways they would make life easier for each other on the court. It's the first time either player, both named to the NBA's list of the top 75 players of all time, will play alongside another superstar.\n\"My whole career has been off-the-dribble 3s, pick-and-roll pull-up 3s, contested [shots]. Double-teamed. Trapped,\" Lillard said. \"I'm curious to see how that can be possible with a player as dominant as [Antetokounmpo] is. I'm excited for an opportunity to play with him. I'm excited for the opportunity to be freed up and the opportunity to have more space and opportunity to play. It's going to be fun.\"\nThe gang takes their first group photo 📸 pic.twitter.com/sIDCbBZmCk\nLillard and Antetokounmpo have long admired each other from afar -- Antetokounmpo made Lillard the No.1 pick during the 2023 All-Star draft -- but what struck them both following their first phone conversation after the trade was how similar their personalities were.\nAntetokounmpo said it was like they were both the same person, if different sizes.\nSo even though this pairing comes with heightened expectations, both stars are approaching the season in similar fashion.\n\"We got to stay locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be so much hype around us, lot more TV games, lot of conversation about us. But at the end of the day, you don't win a championship by making a move.\"\nAdded Lillard: \"It made me feel good to see that he thinks that way.\"\n-- Jamal Collier\n\nThe Celtics spent the past three months getting used to a new normal. There was a total change in locker room voices with Marcus Smart and Grant Williams departing. Joe Mazzulla replaced most of his coaching staff. The arrival of Kristaps Porzingis was a planned adjustment to playing with two big men on the floor most of the time.\nThen, boom, Jrue Holiday got traded 24 hours before the start of media day and the snow globe was shaken up again. Down the line, Celtics players were excited about the deal and praised what they know about Holiday, but there was no doubt the team was a little rocked by the adjustment to the adjustment.\nFor example, guard Derrick White talked about how new assistant coach Sam Cassell came to Colorado this summer to spend some time getting to know him and preparing him for taking over as starting point guard -- and then Boston acquired a new All-Star point guard.\nPorzingis had been in Boston for two weeks working out and getting to know big man Robert Williams III, a defensive anchor whom Porzingis was preparing to play a lot with -- and now will not.\n\"I already could see how Rob is that charismatic guy for this group,\" he said. \"So it definitely hurts for this organization that he's not here anymore.\"\nMazzulla doesn't seem sure what his starting lineup or his rotations will be yet. The team has two roster spots open and is now hunting for another player, likely a big man. Holiday is living out of a suitcase.\nThe Celtics have great promise, but this might take a little time.\n-- Brian Windhorst\n\nSince 1999, the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers have shared the same downtown venue -- formerly Staples Center, currently Crypto.com Arena. But that partnership ends after this season, as the Clippers' new arena, the Intuit Dome located in Inglewood, is slated to open just before the 2024-25 season. Clippers star Paul George, for one, is eager for the switch.\n\"Yeah, I'm ready for us to have our own space,\" he said during Clippers media day Monday. \"I think I can speak to the whole [team] of saying we're tired of all these early games, and so it'd be nice [for] the schedule be a little bit in our favor.\"\nGeorge was referencing how the Clippers are often described as the \"third tenant\" at Crypto.com Arena, behind the Lakers and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, meaning that their schedule has often been sorted out after those of the other teams, which has led to plenty of early-morning tipoffs in the Clippers' schedule. (In 2016, ESPN reported that the Clippers' lease agreement meant that they not only have a lesser say in scheduling but receive a smaller share of proceeds from suites and club seats than the Lakers and Kings.)\nPouring the concrete floor 💪Over 20,000 sq. feet of concrete has been poured to lay the foundation for Intuit Dome's main basketball court and floor pic.twitter.com/yeQpo6I9iA\nClippers players and coaches have railed about this arrangement for years. That said, George said it has been a pleasure to play in Crypto.com Arena, given that it's the same building where Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, whom George admired for years, once played.\n\"It's been awesome, but that was short-lived,\" he said. \"Now, that I've been here for a couple of years, [I'm] not looking forward to the early games. So, again, it'd be nice to have our own space next year.\"\n-- Baxter Holmes\n\nDerrick Rose delivered a simple message during a recent conversation with Ja Morant:\n\"I'm not here to babysit you. I'm not here to follow you around. I'm not here to cheerlead. ... I'm here to push you.\"\nRose's potential to serve as a mentor to Morant, who will practice and travel with the team while serving a 25-game suspension to start the season, was among the factors that made him attractive to the Grizzlies. The 34-year-old Rose has a résumé that commands respect -- highlighted by the 2010-11 MVP award -- and a level of wisdom gained through a 15-year career that has featured plenty of trials and tribulations, both on and off the court.\nBut Rose didn't sign a veteran's deal to return to Memphis, where he played his lone college season before getting selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 draft, to assume the responsibility of preventing Morant from sabotaging his career with continued off-court foolishness.\nGrizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman speaks about the significance of Ja Morant being allowed to travel with the team during his 25-game suspension.\nHe's happy to give advice if Morant is willing to hear it -- such as emphasizing the importance of having the \"discipline to remind yourself or be mindful of the places you're at, who you're with and your actions\" -- but Rose's focus is on the basketball floor.\nRose, who played only 27 games for the New York Knicks last season, believes he still has \"a lot left in the tank\" and looks forward to being able to prove it. He will have a chance to get significant minutes with the Grizzlies, especially early in the season while Morant is unavailable. Rose also anticipates being able to help Morant rise to new levels as a point guard whose high-flying style is reminiscent of Rose's before his career-altering knee injury. \"I'm very fortunate to be in this situation where a lot of people look at his game, they kind of compare our games together, but he's on a whole another level,\" Rose said. \"So really seeing that it's our job to push him and let him know in times whenever he's being reckless to calm down.\"\nA few seconds later, Rose interrupted another question with a clarification: \"When we saying reckless, I'm talking about on the court, guys. On the court.\"\n-- Tim MacMahon\n\nAfter countless hours spent this summer working out alongside LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura was a little taken aback when he saw how small he looked compared to James when the team posted snapshots on social media.\n\"My weight was fine,\" Hachimura said with a chuckle at the Lakers' annual media day Monday. \"But they put the picture next to [LeBron].\" While Hachimura admitted that his body might be more \"defined\" since we last saw him in May when the Lakers were being swept out of the Western Conference finals by the Denver Nuggets, he is planning to punish opponents in the paint much the same way James has mastered.\n\"I just watched him closely and he taught me a lot of little tricks, pointers, the footwork.\" Hachimura said of the joint workouts organized by Lakers assistant coach Phil Handy.\nAs the 38-year-old James enters his 21st season, some drop-off in production from the lofty standard he has set for himself is expected, if not inevitable. But by pouring his knowledge into Hachimura in the summertime, it could mean Hachimura will be better equipped to support him as a teammate during the season.\n\"I see a lot in him,\" James said of Hachimura. \"I call him my Daniel-san and I'm Mr. Miyagi. And I call him my understudy.\"\nHachimura already showed signs of being ready for a starring role last postseason. He opened up the playoffs with 29 points on 11-for-14 shooting against the Grizzlies to help L.A. steal Game 1 of their first-round series on the road.\nHe stayed hot through L.A.'s playoff run, averaging 12.2 points on 55.7/48.7/88.2 shooting splits -- a significant uptick from his efficiency during the regular season after being acquired in a trade with the Washington Wizards in January.\nNow armed with a three-year, $51 million contract extension signed in the offseason, Hachimura is ready for more with the Lakers. Be it as a starter, as James' backup or whatever else he's asked to do -- like when he played some minutes at the 5 against Nikola Jokic in the Denver series.\n\"Playing time is more important for me,\" Hachimura said, \"and I want to finish the game. That's my main thing. And whatever the coaches decide, I'm here for it.\"\n-- Dave McMenamin\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray sat down, reunited not only with each other after the shortest offseason of their pro careers but also with the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\nIt didn't take the Nuggets stars long to get on the same wavelength yet again.\n\"I just think we can do it again,\" Murray said.\nJokic later added: \"Like Jamal said, why not win again?\"\nRepeating will be even more difficult for Jokic and Murray than bringing Denver its first NBA title. Not only have other contenders like Milwaukee, Phoenix and Boston reloaded, but Denver will have to offset its own locker room losses.\nNuggets head coach Michael Malone has sky-high expectations for Jamal Murray entering the 2023-24 season 🌟 #NBAMediaDay pic.twitter.com/Tt45GngfDs\nAlready, coach Michael Malone has challenged his two stars. He wants to see Jokic and Murray take \"ownership\" of the team with vocal vets like Jeff Green and Ish Smith gone.\nAnd he wants to see Murray take his postseason tear and apply it to the entire upcoming regular season and become a first-time All-Star and All-NBA performer. Murray averaged 26.1 points, 7.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds and shot 39.6% from 3 last postseason.\nIf his two stars do that, Malone might find himself trying to top his parade performance next June.\n\"Last season is over,\" Malone said. \"If we're serious about being a team that can repeat, if we're serious about trying to be a team that can be a dynasty, we have to bring our best every single day starting [Tuesday] in practice.\"\n-- Ohm Youngmisuk\n\nAfter a league-worst 17-65 finish last season, Detroit Pistons GM Troy Weaver says he feels the team is \"ready to go\" and compete for a playoff spot.\nWeaver says \"there was never any excuses\" for the lack of success, but he feels like the Pistons are better with the addition of new head coach Monty Williams and the return of former No. 1 pick Cade Cunningham, who missed all but a dozen games last season after undergoing surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left leg.\nA special message from Deuce! pic.twitter.com/ppdIsCSXin\nWhile examining the Eastern Conference landscape in the aftermath of the star player movement such as Lillard's trade to Milwaukee, Weaver doesn't feel that changes the goal in Detroit, which is to return to basketball relevance after finishing .500 or worse in seven consecutive seasons.\n\"I like what Boston and Milwaukee and the rest of those teams do. That's more fuel to what we're trying to do. Realistic goal for our team? Is to play 82 meaningful games,\" Weaver said during media day.\n\"We want to go down to the wire every game with us playing for something. We don't want to just look at the last 25 games and not be in contention. We want to be in contention for 82 games, the entire season.\"\n-- Eric Woodyard\n\nOn the final day the San Antonio Spurs occupied their old facility on 1 Spurs Lane, about a dozen fans stood outside the players exit hoping for an autograph. They were holding the typical items you'd see, such as basketballs and jerseys.\nBut with 2023 No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama in town, there was a new offering awaiting Wembanyama's signature: a 6-foot green inflatable alien wearing a black Spurs Wembanyama jersey.\nWembanyama, who LeBron James called \"an alien\" last year and who Nike dubbed \"The Extraterrestrial\" in a new ad, has taken San Antonio by storm ever since the Spurs won the draft lottery in May.\nSpurs rookie Victor Wembanyama discusses how he's prepared for his first season in the league and what he's looking forward to most in the NBA.\nThere are murals going up around town, including one Wembanyama posed in front of in his latest Instagram post in which he declares himself a \"Certified San Antonian.\"\n\"Man, it's just been so comfortable to have people welcome you like this, and I'm very thankful,\" Wembanyama said Monday. \"I'm a very lucky, lucky human.\"\nNot only has Wembanyama started to acclimate himself to his new city, but he also has done so with his new teammates.\n\"We often have team dinners and team meetings, so I'm really glad everything's happening the way it's happening,\" Wembanyama said. \"And yes, as I was saying, I feel very lucky. I know I'm in a good environment from every aspect.\"\n-- Andrew Lopez\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have become synonymous with small ball, and with the addition of guard Chris Paul and the possibility he could be a starter, the Warriors could have the smallest starting lineup in the NBA.\nThat being said, would they want more options with size? Draymond Green has heard that before.\n\"They said we didn't have enough size in 2022, and we won,\" Green said Monday. \"I've been told I wasn't the right size forever, and I've won. ...\n\"I can show you where we didn't have enough size and we won. In saying that, I'm not totally against having another big.\"\nThe Warriors brought in Dwight Howard for a set of workouts a few weeks ago, but nothing materialized. Golden State did add Usman Garuba on a two-way contract and Rudy Gay on a non-guaranteed training camp deal to add some more size.\nChris Paul says he'll do \"whatever to help our team win\" as he heads into his first season with the Warriors.\nThe two players will surely get more run time in the preseason with Green sidelined for at least the next two weeks with a left ankle sprain -- but the Warriors still don't have a traditional center to back up Kevon Looney.\n\"At the end of the day, I think [Warriors GM] Mike Dunleavy has done an incredible job of filling impossible shoes,\" Green said. \"The No. 1 thing that Mike has to do is come in and create trust with every move that he's been making and moves that he hasn't made. But communicating with us and making sure we're in the know -- that we know certain things -- is incredible.\"\nGreen reiterated the Warriors don't need another big, stating anything they need they already have. But he had a small caveat:\n\"[The] Lakers are huge. That's who we lost to. So if you look at someone and you're like, 'This is who we lost to, where do we need to improve?' Probably need a little bit more size. Doesn't mean we're necessarily going to lose again if we don't get the size. But it may help.\"\n-- Kendra Andrews"}
{"title": "After a massive shake-up, what lies ahead for the Bucks, Celtics and the East's best?", "date": "2023-10-05 04:22:45", "text": "Stephen A. Smith discusses his expectations for the Bucks this season after acquiring Damian Lillard. (1:03)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season kicks off Monday, when media day marks the start of training camp for 28 of the 30 teams across the league. (The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves kicked off their camps on Thursday.)\nThat includes all 15 Eastern Conference teams, some of which are still reeling from the seismic trades of Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks and, after a few days as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, Jrue Holiday to the Boston Celtics.\nWhat are the deals' ripple effects throughout the conference? What could they mean for the future of another star guard, the Philadelphia 76ers' James Harden? Are there more moves on the horizon for the Bucks and Celtics? What's next for the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers after mostly standing pat this offseason?\nAs camps get underway, here's a quick trip around the East, looking at the five biggest questions among the top contenders for home-court advantage in the conference.\nFor all of the attention surrounding the Bucks and Celtics for their blockbuster trades, those completed deals now push Harden's uncertain future to the forefront.\nThis summer, Harden made his feelings clear about Daryl Morey, Philadelphia's president of basketball operations and Harden's longtime ally and advocate going back to successful seasons together with the Houston Rockets. These days, though, there seems to be little love for Morey from Harden.\nNow that Lillard and Holiday are off the board, it's difficult to see the kind of star player coming back to Philadelphia that Morey has publicly declared would be required for Harden to be dealt. Until either Morey changes his stance or some team meets his terms, Harden's lone path to being paid this season is by playing for the 76ers.\nSo, how will Harden react? Will he be fully committed? Is there a world where he could remain in Philadelphia for the entire season?\nAll of these questions, and others, will be asked of Harden on Monday at the team's media day at its practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, and then in the days to come during the team's training camp in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nHarden can be asked those questions only if he actually shows up.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey and coach Nick Nurse address James Harden's absence from media day and his trade request.\nMeanwhile, the 76ers will be adjusting to life under a new coach, former Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse, and it's safe to say the league's reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, registered his feelings about the summer by tweeting Sunday afternoon, \"This offseason was fun lmao.\"\nFor a Philadelphia franchise that has been consumed by virtually constant drama for a decade, there will be no shortage of it in the coming weeks.\nThe Heat never think they are out of options when it comes to acquiring talent, a hard-earned belief from nearly three decades of team president Pat Riley's tenure lording over the franchise.\nBut it's hard to argue this summer has been anything but a disappointment for the reigning East champs. Miami attempted to acquire Damian Lillard -- the exact kind of ball-dominant guard who would have been a perfect fit alongside Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.\nHoliday, while not Lillard from an offensive standpoint, is the type of tough-minded two-way player the Heat have always gravitated toward throughout Riley's tenure and would have fit seamlessly next to Butler on the perimeter.\nInstead, the Heat's chief competition -- the Bucks and Celtics -- landed the star guards, and two key players from last season's stunning playoff run -- Gabe Vincent and Max Strus -- signed with the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively, in free agency.\n\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nThe Heat, who pride themselves on getting contributions from unheralded role players, did bring back Josh Richardson on a team-friendly deal to replace Vincent, will be moving Duncan Robinson into Strus' role as a floor spacer and scorer -- one he occupied before Strus stepped into it over the past season-plus -- and will look for contributions from second-year forward Nikola Jovic and rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr., two of the players who could've gone out in a deal for a guard who instead wound up staying put.\nMiami should remain in the hunt for any stars who become available. But this summer was a short-term setback. And while doubting either Jimmy Butler or coach Erik Spoelstra should be done at one's peril, Miami's road to a fourth conference finals in five seasons got a lot tougher over the past week.\nBetween the Bucks swinging for the fences with Lillard and the Celtics doing the same with Holiday, it's been a wild week atop the East.\nIn Milwaukee, there might not be a better one-two punch in the NBA, in terms of star power, than Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. The duo should help the Bucks' offense skyrocket up league rankings after finishing 15th last season (albeit with three-time All-Star forward Khris Middleton missing most of the season with injuries).\nBrian Windhorst explains why the Milwaukee Bucks are under tremendous pressure to win an NBA championship to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo.\nMilwaukee's perimeter defense, eighth in the league last season in opponent 3-point percentage, takes a significant step back with the loss of Holiday, arguably the NBA's best two-way guard.\nBoston, on the other hand, started the offseason by sending Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of a three-team trade to land Kristaps Porzingis and ended it with another massive swing in getting Holiday.\nThe Celtics enter training camp with arguably the best top six in the league -- Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Al Horford, Porzingis and Holiday -- but the overflow of talent leaves questions over whether Horford or White will be the one to come off the bench.\nThe four others, however, figure to end virtually every game on the court together, and give Boston arguably an unmatched level of versatility.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nBeyond its top six, Boston's roster is littered with either lower-paid or inexperienced options for second-year coach Joe Mazzulla. Horford and Porzingis, the team's two stretch big men, come with durability concerns, given Horford is 37 and Porzingis has played 65 or more games only three times in nine NBA seasons.\nAnd while the Celtics still have all but one of their future firsts to put in deals even after getting Holiday, they don't have much salary to put together to make a deal to upgrade the roster.\nBy the time the Celtics and Bucks meet for the first time on Nov. 22 in Boston (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN), we'll have a lot more of an idea of what these groups look like. As of now, though, these two teams appear poised to be on a playoff collision course for the fourth time in the past seven seasons.\nAfter a five-year playoff absence, it was a rough return for Cleveland, which lost in five games to the New York Knicks as the higher-seeded team -- including twice on its home court. Throughout that first-round series, the Cavaliers looked severely hampered by their lack of postseason experience, as well as really bothered by their lack of perimeter shooting, as New York sagged far off poor-shooting options like forward Isaac Okoro throughout the series.\nThe Cavaliers made it a priority to address their shooting deficiencies this offseason, signing Max Strus from the Heat and Georges Niang from the 76ers. Both of them will give Cleveland a lot more offensive versatility and should prevent the Cavaliers from returning to the rotating cast of characters who struggled to adequately fill the fifth spot on the court last season alongside the quartet of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen.\nThe duo's presence also should allow Cleveland more versatility to play small, something the Cavs didn't have an easy way to do last season.\nThe overarching question for this season in Cleveland, however, surrounds Mitchell, and whether Cleveland can do enough to convince the four-time All-Star to agree to a contract extension next summer, when he will be one year away from free agency.\nDoing so begins with improving on last season's first-round flop. Strus and Niang were brought in to play a part in that. Another factor will be the offensive development of Mobley, who has quickly become a dominant force defensively but is still a ways away from the two-way star Cleveland will need to contend with the likes of Milwaukee and Boston.\nIt was another relatively quiet offseason for the Knicks, who made a shrewd pickup to land Donte DiVincenzo as a free agent, pairing him with Villanova teammates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart.\nBut standing pat made sense. New York had a breakthrough last season, beating Cleveland to reach the second round of the playoffs behind the play of last year's home run free agent signing in Brunson, and giving hope to the legions of Knicks fans in the tristate area that a brighter future might finally be around the corner.\nNew York is still waiting, however, for the moment when it can push in its chips for the right player. The Knicks chose not to do so with Mitchell last summer. They didn't with Beal, Lillard or Holiday this year.\nBut what if someone like Antetokounmpo or Embiid becomes available next summer? What if Cleveland struggles and Mitchell, a year away from free agency, makes it clear he won't stay?\nIf a disgruntled superstar suddenly becomes available via trade, the Knicks, between their combination of draft assets and players under contract, are positioned to make an enticing offer.\nIn the meantime, if the Knicks can build on the momentum they've created with their play last season -- their playoff series win was the franchise's first since 2013 -- the appeal of playing home games inside Madison Square Garden could return."}

(2:18)\nWhen Arsenal approached Manchester City over the availability of full-back João Cancelo earlier this summer, the short-shrift response signalled a marked change in attitude from a year earlier.\nCity had then allowed striker Gabriel Jesus and left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko to join the Gunners for fees totalling around £90 million, deals which at the time seemed to reflect both Mikel Arteta's growing reputation as a coach and the amiable nature of his friendship with his former boss at City, Pep Guardiola.\nThe arrivals of Jesus and Zinchenko helped clarify Arteta's vision for the Gunners more than anyone imagined -- the team that finished 24 points behind City in 2021-22 suddenly emerged as their main rivals, ending the season in second place having spent a total of 248 days at the top of the table.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nSo much so, in fact, that as Arsenal tried their luck in negotiations for another player to have fallen out of favour in Cancelo, City's approach had completely altered.\n\"City's view of us is completely different this year than last,\" one senior executive at Arsenal told ESPN.\nCancelo's relationship with Guardiola had deteriorated and a permanent transfer fee in excess of £50m was suggested. The Gunners would not necessarily have been deterred by that valuation, but City had no intention of strengthening Arteta's side once again.\nWith Jesus and Zinchenko, City acquiesced to Arsenal on the basis of receiving healthy transfer fees for two players about the enter the final year of their respective contracts. This time, City ended up agreeing on a simple loan with Barcelona for Cancelo in a move that contained no option or obligation to sign permanently and a modest loan fee. Whatever the financial hit, City's view was that Cancelo should not join Arsenal. They had benefitted enough previously.\nFor the Gunners, the versatile Jurriën Timber represented a much more viable option and they moved to sign him for £38m from Ajax. Arsenal were also interested in City midfielder Ilkay Gündogan but he chose to join Barcelona at the end of his contract, a move he later described as a \"childhood dream\" and one which ensured City avoided any further embarrassment.\nThere was a time when City regularly signed players from Arsenal: five players -- Kolo Toure, Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri -- made the journey north between 2009 and 2014 as City's Abu Dhabi takeover gave them a wealth the Gunners could not compete with.\nThe recent reversal was down, in part, to City simply not viewing Arsenal as a direct threat; the same could arguably be true of Chelsea now given they allowed Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer to join the Blues in the last 16 months.\nCity's stance on Cancelo is symptomatic of the respect Arsenal gained through last season's title challenge. Sources have told ESPN that it didn't take Guardiola long to realise how much the players had helped Arteta's rebuild. It is said Arsenal's 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea in Orlando last July was the moment he first thought the club were on their way to becoming a serious proposition.\nChelsea were in disarray at the time -- and would sack head coach Thomas Tuchel a month or so later -- but the Gunners exhibited a fluidity and determination that would propel them up the table in the subsequent campaign.\nThey fell short of a first Premier League title since 2004, somewhat running out of steam as a combination of fatigue, inexperience and William Saliba's injury undermined performances in the final few weeks. But City knew they were in a proper fight, run close by a team that, while not yet good enough to be considered an equal, is certainly reducing the gap at significant speed.\nSunday's meeting between the two sides offers a measure of that progress and a chance for Arsenal to address another key factor in separating these sides: the head-to-head record.\nDespite the pressure City were under in pursuing a treble, they gave Arsenal something of a schooling in both Premier League matches last season in addition to knocking Arteta's side out of the FA Cup at the third-round stage.\nThe first league meeting was originally pushed back from October to February as a result of fixture complications related to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. City outclassed Arsenal in a 3-1 win at Emirates Stadium and beat them 4-1 in April as Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland ripped the Gunners to shreds.\nAugust's Community Shield victory over City on penalties was hailed by goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale as \"a marker to know we can go and beat Man City in a big game when it matters\" but a Premier League win this weekend can have a truly transformative effect.\nArsenal have lost their last 12 league meetings with City; they have not taken three points off them since January 2015.\nIf City view Arsenal differently, the opposite could also be true. Perhaps, finally, Arsenal believe they are beatable. City unexpectedly lost 2-1 to Wolves last weekend and the suspension of midfielder Rodri -- who played more league minutes than any other City player last season -- after his red card, alongside the absense of injured playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, makes them a less formidable proposition.\nMidfield is an area where Declan Rice will look to take centre stage, having been the subject of offers from both Arsenal and City prior to leaving West Ham for an initial £100m this summer.\nCity felt Arsenal could still be bullied in a physical challenge, particularly in April's game when they went more direct to Haaland to use his power. Rice offers more robustness, but he will also need to exhibit bravery in his passing to help Arsenal impose themselves.\nHad City signed Rice, he would almost certainly have lined up against Arsenal this weekend with Rodri suspended but, as it is, he will seek to reinvigorate Arteta's side as they aim to shake off a Champions League midweek defeat to Lens.\nBukayo Saka's fitness will make a significant difference -- the club are waiting on scan results to determine the extent of a muscular problem -- but whether the 22-year-old forward is available or not, one thing is for sure: City won't underestimate Arsenal any longer."}
{"title": "Sorry, Jurgen: Liverpool won't get replay over Diaz VAR row", "date": "2023-10-05 12:29:45", "text": "Dale Johnson explains the sequence of events that led to Luis Díaz's goal being incorrectly disallowed vs. Tottenham. (1:41)\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he wants his side's Premier League game against Tottenham Hotspur to be replayed after a Luis Díaz goal was incorrectly ruled out for offside in one of the worst errors in the history of VAR.\nThe score was 0-0 in the 34th minute when the incident happened, and Liverpool went on to lose 2-1 to an injury-time Joël Matip own goal.\n- The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Díaz's offside goal\n- VAR's wildest moments: Diaz offside, Alisson's two red cards\nBut does Klopp have any grounds for the match to be replayed? And is it even possible? We look at what's happened.\nProfessional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the governing body for referees, has admitted \"standards fell short of expectations\" for the Díaz goal.\nThe VAR during the game, Darren England, incorrectly thought the on-field decision was \"goal.\" While he quickly identified that Díaz was onside, he told the referee \"check complete\" -- which mistakenly indicated to the on-field team that the offside flag was correct.\nThe game restarted with the score still 0-0.\nPGMOL subsequently released the full audio of the VAR conversation.\nOn Wednesday, he told a news conference: \"Not as a manager of Liverpool so much, more as a football person, I think the only outcome should be a replay. Probably will not happen. The argument against that will probably be that if we open that gate then everyone will ask for it.\n\"I think the situation is that unprecedented that ... something like that, as far as I can remember, never happened. That's why a replay would be the right thing.\"\nNo yet, as Klopp says the club are still \"going through the information we have.\"\nOn Sunday night, Liverpool issued a strongly worded statement which said the error \"undermined sporting integrity.\"\nYes. As you can imagine, the possibility of having to replay a match, for whatever reason, has to be covered within the Premier League rule book.\nRule L.18. states: \"The Board shall have power to order that a League Match be replayed provided that a recommendation to that effect has been made by a Commission in exercise of its powers under Rule W.51.\"\nBut that doesn't automatically mean the rule applies in a case like this.\nLiverpool would have to lodge a complaint with the Premier League. A commission would then be set up (as per Rule W.51) to assess the merits of the case and reach a decision.\nWithin the remit of the commission is to \"recommend that the Board orders that a League Match or such other match ... be replayed.\"\nNot in English league football. Cup games have been replayed due to a number of factors, including a team making too many substitutes or fielding an ineligible player.\nFamously in 1999, an FA Cup game between Arsenal and Sheffield United was replayed after the Gunners scored from a throw-in after the opposition had knocked the ball out for an Arsenal player to receive treatment. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger later made the offer to replay the match.\nThat might help things along, but the Premier League would still need to agree amid the danger of a precedent being set.\nThis is where it starts to fall down.\nVAR protocol, which is part of the Laws of the Game, states: \"In principle, a match is not invalidated because of: wrong decision(s) involving the VAR (as the VAR is a match official).\"\nThis is where we need to revisit Liverpool's statement, where they very specifically said: \"It is clear that the correct application of the laws of the game did not occur.\"\nWhile a wrong decision might not be grounds for a game to be played again, failing to apply the Laws of the Game correctly can be seen as a valid reason.\nHowever, this is usually a more technical reason, such as a team being allowed to score a goal through an incorrect application of encroachment on a missed penalty.\nJulien Laurens thinks Luis Díaz's disallowed goal in Tottenham vs. Liverpool is the biggest VAR mistake in the Premier League so far this season.\nIt is likely they will say the \"wrong\" decision was not made by the match officials. The VAR knew Diaz was onside, and was supposed to be telling the referee the forward was onside. Therefore, this is a mistake in applying the decision rather than simply getting it wrong.\nThe closest is probably the goal France had disallowed against Tunisia at the World Cup last year.\nAntoine Griezmann thought he had equalised deep into stoppage time, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. However, the referee had restarted the game, and then blown for full-time before the review happened -- which broke VAR protocol. It should not have been possible to disallow the goal.\nFrance protested and wanted the goal to be reinstated, but the appeal was dismissed by FIFA's disciplinary committee and the result stood.\nWhy didn't Arsenal get a replay when the VAR failed to disallow Brentford's goal for offside last season? The VAR didn't notice there was a player offside, so it was an error.\nWhat about the goal Sheffield United were not awarded in the 0-0 draw with Aston Villa when goal-line technology failed? The VAR didn't check for a tech failure, so they didn't know it happened.\nAnd how about Brighton's disallowed goal at Crystal Palace when the VAR drew the lines on the wrong player? The VAR decision was offside and communicated as offside.\nFor Liverpool, the VAR decision was onside and communicated as offside, and that's the difference they will point to.\nIt's highly unlikely. Even though it was a unique circumstance, it would set a dangerous precedent.\nIf they did, could Wolves then ask to replay their game at Manchester United after they were wrongly denied an injury-time penalty through a bad VAR decision?\nIf Liverpool do make an official request it is unlikely to go down well with other clubs, who have all suffered their own injustices, none more so than Brighton who were subjected to a catalogue of errors last season which may have impacted their chances of making the Champions League this season."}
{"title": "USWNT Big Board: With no coach and no momentum, how will 2024 Olympics team look?", "date": "2023-10-04 15:19:36", "text": "Lynn Williams joins \"Futbol Americas\" to talk about why the USWNT failed at the FIFA Women's World Cup. (1:41)\nThe U.S. women's national team has no coach, no coherent tactical identity and nothing to build upon after a worst-ever round-of-16 exit in the Women's World Cup. And yet the USWNT is about 10 months away from another marquee tournament in the form of the 2024 Olympics.\nLet's start out with a basic point: the Olympics, which are a senior competition on the women's side (unlike the men's side), -- are not nearly as important as the World Cup. At just 12 teams, it's not even half the size of the World Cup. But winning a gold medal at the Olympics in France next summer would certainly soothe some of the sting from hitting that lowest point in USWNT history -- a round of 16 exit -- this year.\nWho will be the players who can help the USWNT do that? It's hard to say with any certainty without a coach. Enter ESPN's 2024 USWNT Big Board.\nRemember: the point of the Big Board is not to predict what the team will look like next summer, but take the pulse of where the USWNT stands right now. Will the next coach have a turnkey roster and strong player pool to work with? Or will he or she need to do some work to get the squad into shape? Let's take a look.\nIf the USWNT were to compete in the Olympics today, who should start? Who should be on the roster? That's what we're trying to figure out.\nThere's no coach, of course -- U.S. Soccer wants to hire one by December -- so we have no previous lineups or statements on which to base this depth chart. Instead, this is a bit of the author's opinion (hi, that's me!) and a bit of analyzing where the player pool seems to be trending. We don't know if the USWNT will drastically change formations under the new coach -- wingbacks, anyone? -- so for now we're assuming the USWNT's tactical shape will look similar to how it has for the past few years.\nAn important roster note up top, too: Olympic rosters are much different than for the World Cup. They are traditionally much smaller than World Cup rosters -- while a Women's World Cup squad comprises 23 players, with three of them required to be goalkeepers, an Olympic squad is just 18 players, with two specific goalkeepers.\nAnother difference is that Olympic rosters have four alternates, one of them a goalkeeper -- players who aren't available for games, but do travel and train with the team, only joining the roster in case of tournament-ending injury. For the delayed 2021 Olympics, alternates were added to the full roster because of the pandemic, but it's unclear whether that will happen again.\nWe're categorizing the Big Board like this:\nTier 1: Starters.  A clear first-choice player.\nTier 2: In the squad. Not a starter, but a substitute and player on the bench available to go into games.\nTier 3: On the bubble.  These are possible alternates, or players who might miss out on the Olympics completely. Players who have had a passing look or players who were once integral but no longer seem in favor fit into this category.\nTier 4: Longshots. These are the players whose chances of making the Olympics at the moment look low. This includes players performing well for their clubs who haven't gotten a look. This category also includes injured players who, today, aren't healthy enough to make it (and it doesn't mean their status can't change once they recover).\nStarter:  Alyssa Naeher\nIn the squad:  Casey Murphy\nOn the bubble:  Aubrey Kingsbury, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Katie Lund, Jane Campbell, Bella Bixby\nLongshot:  Adrianna Franch\nOther than centerback Naomi Girma, who was a breakout star in her debut World Cup, the USWNT's best player in New Zealand and Australia was quite possibly Alyssa Naeher. She continues to play well for the USWNT, even if she hasn't enjoyed the same level of shot-stopping domestically with her Chicago Red Stars.\nThe question: who will be her backup? Casey Murphy still seems to be the No. 2 and based on her time with the USWNT, that probably hasn't changed, regardless of anything happening in the NWSL. But Aubrey Kingsbury, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Katie Lund, Jane Campbell and Bella Bixby are all viable options as a third goalkeeper or an alternate. After Adrianna Franch lost her starting spot in Kansas City and then didn't make the USWNT's World Cup team, it seems her time with the national team is over.\nAubrey Kingsbury, 31, was the third goalkeeper at the World Cup based on her strong club play for the Washington Spirit. But 26-year-old Tullis-Joyce, who just completed a move to Manchester United, and 26-year-old Lund, who has been excellent for Racing Louisville, could deserve a shot. It's not too soon to get some younger goalkeepers time with the team and get a succession plan behind 35-year-old Naeher. In fact, it probably makes more sense to call in some younger, less experienced goalkeepers for the third and fourth spots.\nStarters: Crystal Dunn, Emily Fox\nIn the squad:  Sofia Huerta\nOn the bubble:  M.A. Vignola, Kelley O'Hara, Casey Krueger, Hailie Mace, Carson Pickett\nLongshot:  Jenna Nighswonger, Imani Dorsey, Caprice Dydasco, Kristen McNabb, Merritt Mathias\nCrystal Dunn shares her hopes for what she would like to see from the next USWNT manager.\nIt's really hard to say who should or will be on the team outside of the starters, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox, who didn't really do anything to lose their spots during the World Cup. It seems like everyone else is fighting just to get a call.\nSofia Huerta has had a lot of call-ups with the USWNT, but she's better at attacking than defending, thus she can be a liability, and she didn't play during the World Cup. Kelley O'Hara has been consistently solid for the USWNT, but she's increasingly injury prone as she nears the twilight of her career. Casey Krueger has been a better defender than attacker and the USWNT likes to play more attacking soccer, but she's solid enough on both sides that she has a strong case.\nM.A. Vignola just earned her first cap for the USWNT in a friendly last month. Hailie Mace and Carson Pickett have both been in with the USWNT before, but very much seem to be on the outskirts of the player pool. That gives way to several players who have been good for their clubs, but have been unable to gain a foothold in the USWNT.\nIf I were coach -- and to be clear, U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker has not called me yet -- I'd start turning the page to the 2027 World Cup cycle. That could mean potentially bringing in Vignola because the USWNT desperately needs to build some fullback depth. A player like 22-year-old Jenna Nighswonger isn't ready for the Olympics, but might deserve a call-up based on solid NWSL play, versatility in being able to play multiple positions and, again, an alarming lack of depth in the pool. The USWNT needs more options.\nGoing into the Olympics, the USWNT's defense has been solid enough that leaning a bit more attack-minded for the Olympics with Huerta seems worth it. The next coach, who will be coming in with no track record, might feel the need to go with a safer choice like Krueger or O'Hara.\nStarters:  Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson\nIn the squad:  Emily Sonnett\nOn the bubble:  Becky Sauerbrunn, Alana Cook\nLongshot:  Abby Dahlkemper, Emily Madril, Lilly Reale, Sarah Gorden, Katie Ling, Paige Nielsen, Sam Hiatt, Sam Staab, Emily Menges, Tatumn Milazzo\nFirst of all, is Emily Sonnett even a centerback? Is she a fullback? Is she a defensive midfielder now? This is something the next coach needs to decide, but right now we're slotting her in at centerback because the USWNT has few proven options there. We've also given her a confirmed spot in the squad because on a small Olympics roster, having a player who can fit multiple positions is incredibly valuable.\nIt might seem a bit harsh to drop Alana Cook from being on the World Cup team to fighting for a spot for the Olympics, but she didn't play at all during the tournament and, in the lead-up to the World Cup, Cook didn't really do enough in games to have earned a spot. An injury to Becky Sauerbrunn and a too-late recovery from Tierna Davidson seemed like the catalyst.\nWith Julie Ertz retired, clear starter Naomi Girma could use another veteran alongside her, and Sauerbrunn is still not playing 90 minutes since her pre-World Cup injury. Davidson fits the bill. Abby Dahlkemper only recently returned from a long layoff for a back injury; she needs more games under her belt, but it's a promising return for the former USWNT centerback.\nStarters:  Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Andi Sullivan\nIn the squad:  Ashley Sanchez, Savannah DeMelo, Sam Coffey\nOn the bubble:  Jaedyn Shaw, Kristie Mewis, Taylor Kornieck\nLongshot:  Jaelin Howell, Olivia Moultrie, Samantha Mewis, Morgan Gautrat, Dani Weatherholt, Lo'eau LaBonta, Chloe Ricketts, Korbin Albert\nThe go-to trio of Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan and Andi Sullivan feels like it shouldn't change -- unless the USWNT changes its formation and configures its midfield differently. (Let's face it, the USWNT probably needs to change its tactical system based on the players it has, but that's a whole other conversation.) Regardless, these are three players who should be at the Olympics.\nSullivan has taken a lot of criticism for not being Ertz, basically, but under the right tactical setup (i.e., the too-late formation shift against Sweden at the World Cup), she is a solid defensive midfielder. We don't know what tactical setup the USWNT will have under the next coach, but there isn't a tactical system in which Sullivan suddenly doesn't have any role with the USWNT.\nOutside of these three, however, it's time for the USWNT to go younger. Ashley Sanchez, 24, didn't play at all at the World Cup, and she should've. With the sensational season that 25-year-old Savannah DeMelo was having, it seemed unfair to name her to the World Cup roster without a USWNT cap to her name. She had no time to build chemistry with the players around her or figure out where she fit in, and we didn't see her at her best.\nSam Coffey, 24, should be the USWNT's next defensive midfielder. Jaelin Howell, 23, is currently injured, but is an interesting alternative to Coffey.\nStarter: Lynn Williams, Trinity Rodman\nIn the squad:  Alyssa Thompson\nOn the bubble:  Margaret \"Midge\" Purce\nLongshot:  Mallory Swanson, Cece Kizer, Melanie Barcenas, Christen Press, Tobin Heath\nHerc Gomez brands Megan Rapinoe's 17-year USWNT career one of the most dominant eras in sporting history.\nMallory Swanson is listed as a long shot right now only because she's injured. (If Swanson had been healthy, the USWNT's World Cup probably would've gone much better.)\nNo one on the USWNT right now provides the service and creates the chances that now-retired Megan Rapinoe used to, particularly on set pieces. In a sense, that makes this position feel more open than the relative strength of the player options suggests. The USWNT needs wingers who can play provider -- the World Cup, where it seemed like the USWNT's wingers were just strikers, proved that.\nLynn Williams is a dependable player who will press relentlessly, create chances, track back to defend and do all the things the USWNT needs. She might not be the best at everything, but she is good and well rounded. Trinity Rodman, under the right setup, will flourish on the wing. Rodman didn't flourish during the World Cup, but that's why the Olympics can't be the same lineup as the World Cup was -- almost no one flourished. Move some pieces around Rodman and change her role slightly, and her effectiveness should be unlocked.\nEven after making the World Cup team, Alyssa Thompson's inclusion seems more about building toward 2027 rather than winning an Olympics. If you want to follow the model of former coach Jill Ellis, who bombed at an Olympics but then won a World Cup, this makes sense. She barely played at the World Cup and should've seen the field more.\nStarter:  Sophia Smith\nIn the squad:  Alex Morgan\nOn the bubble: Jaedyn Shaw, Mia Fishel, Ashley Hatch\nLongshot: Catarina Macario, Kristen Hamilton, Bethany Balcer\nSophia Smith has played as a winger on the USWNT, including at the World Cup, but that tournament proved Smith should be playing in front of goal. She's an elite striker in the NWSL, and asking her to play out wide means some of her best attributes don't translate and get lost. Her World Cup was bad, and you can place some of the blame on her role.\nAlex Morgan has been a great striker for the USWNT and in the NWSL, but she struggled badly at the World Cup -- her failed penalty kick in the opening game of the tournament became an omen for her first World Cup without scoring a goal. Is she still effective? Probably: she wasn't getting the best service during the World Cup. But with an eye toward the next World Cup, it might suit 34-year-old Morgan to come off the bench instead.\nThe big question is what happens when Catarina Macario comes back from injury -- she still hasn't played in a game since last year, but played as both a striker and a midfielder for the USWNT. (I'd argue with her excellent vision, service and ability on the ball, playing as a winger could suit her -- especially with a lack of wingers in the player pool with her skills.) Macario is the kind of player who needs to be on the field -- once fit, at least.\nAnother question: Should 18-year-old Jaedyn Shaw be a central attacking midfielder, or a striker? She says she prefers to be a No. 10 playmaker, but the USWNT player pool might have more room right now for another striker and, well, she's good at both. Either way, she is a player whose development is worth keeping an eye on. If the next coach goes full bore on the next generation for the Olympics, Shaw could even take Morgan's spot."}

{"title": "Boxing pound-for-pound rankings: Did Canelo do enough to rise?", "date": "2023-10-04 14:49:19", "text": "Canelo Alvarez delivered another one-sided victory to retain his super middleweight undisputed championship Saturday night in Las Vegas. However, he failed to score a KO victory over a smaller Jermell Charlo -- who was moving up two divisions for the challenge -- to make a claim for a higher spot in the top 10.\nAlvarez (60-2-2, 39 KOs) dominated the fight from the start and dropped Charlo in Round 7 with a powerful overhand right. Alvarez won by scorecards of 118-109, 118-109 and 119-108, but he hasn't scored a stoppage win in almost two years -- an 11th-round TKO against Caleb Plant in November 2021.\nWith the three fighters in front of him in ESPN's pound-for-pound rankings -- Terence Crawford, Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk -- scoring incredible KO victories in their most recent fights, Alvarez wasn't able to convince our panelists to move him up the ladder.\nFurthermore, two-division champion and current ESPN boxing analyst and a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Timothy Bradley Jr., dropped Alvarez one spot on his list.\n\"While I understand that personal preferences, expectations and entertainment play a role in the P4P it's important to acknowledge and evaluate the reality of each fighter's performances,\" Bradley told ESPN. \"In this case of the top pound-for-pound boxers in the world, it's reasonable to expect dominant performances against opponents who are significantly lighter. Their skills and abilities are widely recognized, and it's natural to assume that they would overpower and knockout opponents outside their weight class.\n\"Regarding Canelo's recent performance, he fought a junior middleweight as a super middleweight 168-pounder and had a subpar performance, in my eyes. So for him to maintain his position at No. 5 on my list he needed a knockout. The other top fighters, Crawford, Inoue, Usyk, or Dmitry Bivol, I assure you, all would have KOs against smaller opposition.\"\nOur panel of Mike Coppinger, Ben Baby, Timothy Bradley Jr., Michael Rothstein, Joe Tessitore, Teddy Atlas, Nick Parkinson, Eric Raskin, Michelle Joy Phelps, Bernardo Osuna, Eric Woodyard, Kel Dansby, Bernardo Pilatti, Charles Moynihan, Salvador Rodriguez, Jim Zirolli, Michael Mascaro and Aladdin Freeman share their votes.\nMore rankings: Divisional rankings and ESPN's women's pound-for-pound rankings.\nNote: Results are through Oct. 4.\nRECORD: 40-0, 31 KOs\nDIVISION: Welterweight (undisputed champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (TKO9) Errol Spence Jr., July 29\nNEXT FIGHT: TBA\nRECORD: 25-0, 22 KOs\nDIVISION: Junior featherweight (unified champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (TKO8) Stephen Fulton, July 25\nNEXT FIGHT: TBA\nRECORD: 21-0, 14 KOs\nDIVISION: Heavyweight (unified champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (TKO9) Daniel Dubois, Aug. 26\nNEXT FIGHT: TBA vs. Tyson Fury\nRECORD: 60-2-2, 39 KOs\nDIVISION: Super middleweight (undisputed champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (UD12) Jermell Charlo, Sept. 30\nNEXT FIGHT: TBA\nRECORD: 21-0, 11 KOs\nDIVISION: Light heavyweight (champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (UD12) Gilberto Ramirez, Nov. 5\nNEXT FIGHT: TBA\nRECORD: 33-0-1, 24 KOs\nDIVISION: Heavyweight (champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (TKO10) Derek Chisora, Dec. 3\nNEXT FIGHT: Oct. 28 vs. Francis Ngannou\nRECORD: 19-0, 19 KOs\nDIVISION: Light heavyweight (unified champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (TKO8) Anthony Yarde, Jan. 28\nNEXT FIGHT: Jan. 13 vs. Callum Smith\nRECORD: 30-0, 15 KOs\nDIVISION: Lightweight (undisputed champion)\nLAST FIGHT: W (UD12) Vasiliy Lomachenko, May 20\nNEXT FIGHT: Dec. 9 vs. Regis Prograis\nRECORD: 20-0, 10 KOs\nDIVISION: Lightweight\nLAST FIGHT: W (TKO6) Shuichiro Yoshino, April 8\nNEXT FIGHT: Nov. 16 vs. Edwin De Los Santos\nRECORD: 29-0, 27 KOs\nDIVISION: Lightweight\nLAST FIGHT: W (KO7) Ryan Garcia, April 22\nNEXT FIGHT: TBA\nThe rankings are based on a descending points system, with a first-place vote receiving 10 points, a second-place vote receiving nine points, and so on.

(1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind. With the majority of drafted players entering the NBA in their late teens or very early 20s, and many of those players international, the development process from prospect to professional can extend beyond a single season. .\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball.\nAs you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}
{"title": "Six rookies to draft and eight others to keep an eye on", "date": "2023-10-02 21:40:37", "text": "Andre Snellings breaks down why Jarace Walker and Keyonte George are two rookies that fantasy managers should keep an eye on this season. (2:20)\nWe say it every year -- typically, rookies aren't drafted until the middle to late rounds in fantasy basketball.\nYes, every now and then, there's a hyped up player who sneaks into round three (like this year), but most seasons the top rookie won't go until the fourth or fifth round at the earliest.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThis presents a major opportunity for the savvy fantasy manager, who dedicates the early rounds to setting up the foundation of their team while having a certain rookie or two in mind for the middle and late rounds. Find the right rookies, and this can be a winning formula.\nBut who are the rookies to have this season? And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ½ inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}
{"title": "Goalie tandem picks: Which player should you draft?", "date": "2023-10-03 12:54:37", "text": "I feel like it's safer trying to predict the rainfall on a day six months from now than it is to confidently state how the goaltender position will play out in the coming fantasy hockey season.\nThat's not to say there aren't safer bets out there -- but you have to pay for them. Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Jake Oettinger, Connor Hellebuyck ... they are likely to be better investments for your fantasy squad, but they'll cost a high draft pick.\nBut winning your league last year was better accomplished by drafting Linus Ullmark and Alexandar Georgiev, which was just a matter of backing the right two sleepers. Who will those sleepers be this season? As implied, that's a tough call.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nMore than ever, a winning fantasy strategy can be lifted from the world of tandems. When one emerges and dominates, it's a low-cost draft investment that can lead to championships (think Ullmark). But even if the time split remains, goaltenders can earn fantasy value -- Ilya Samsonov placed 108th overall last season with only 50.2% crease share and Filip Gustavsson was 81st overall with only 46.5% crease share.\nWe've listed the teams below most likely to use a tandem this season. Some are more likely than others and some are just a guess given the current status of their goaltenders. There's also a chance we missed some that could emerge. But when doing your draft shopping for your crease, don't overlook the potential value of a goaltender projected to get just 50% of the crease share.\nRelevant stats for each goaltender include their crease share from last season, their overall ranking for fantasy, their fantasy points per 60 minutes, and their average draft position so far this draft season. Remember that an ADP higher than about 220 means they are not being drafted in most ESPN leagues.\nLinus Ullmark: 58.9% crease share, fourth overall fantasy points, 5.38 fantasy points per game (FPP60), 38.2 average draft position (ADP)\nJeremy Swayman: 41.1% crease share, 144th overall, 4.04 FPP60, 108.6 ADP\nThis is the potential tandem that will offer the most headaches for fantasy managers. Ullmark blew away the field last season and would be a no-brainer first-round fantasy pick if we knew he was going to do it again. But so many offseason changes, not the least of which was the retirement of Patrice Bergeron, leaves a lot of questions. Are the Bruins as good defensively? Do they win as frequently? But even beyond those questions, Swayman earned himself a raise and a chance to prove he has a long-term future as a starter for the club.\nI would not advise paying the premium for Ullmark given the question marks, but if he falls in your lap closer to the 70th-overall pick, I could get on board. Given that Swayman is on the weak side of the tandem, his draft price of 108th on average is also on the high end. But let's be clear: Both of these goaltenders have the potential to be fantasy difference-markers in 2023-24. The problem is that we can't say that with heaps of confidence for either one.\nAdin Hill: 33.7% crease share, 451st overall, 3.02 FPP60, 211.3 ADP\nLogan Thompson: 49.1% crease share, 248th overall, 2.99 FPP60, 241.9 ADP\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nNeither goaltender was a staple of fantasy clubs for most of last season, though Thompson had some nice runs earlier in the campaign. But we all know what Hill did after the regular season in leading the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup. There's an argument to be made that this isn't a tandem coming into the season, with Hill earning a massive raise, but Hill has never played more than 27 games in an NHL season before, so it's hard to call him a workhorse starter at this stage.\nThis will probably be a \"hot-hand\" crease, with whichever goaltender is having a solid run getting the lion's share of starts. After Hill was so dominant in the postseason, he would be my preference for a fantasy team. That said, there is a chance you can secure both later in drafts and have the crease of the defending champions locked up on your roster.\nStuart Skinner: 58.9% crease share, 132nd overall, 2.86 FPP60, 158.0 ADP\nJack Campbell: 41.1% crease share, 627th overall, 1.29 FPP60, 229.0 ADP\nThis tandem, like the Golden Knights, had a flip-flop from the regular season to the postseason. Skinner was the hero in the regular season, taking the starting job away from Campbell and keeping the Oilers on track for the playoffs. But Skinner stumbled in the postseason, with Campbell coming on in relief multiple times and not looking too bad. That narrative from the playoffs was arguably enough for a soft reset on whose crease this is coming into 2023-24.\nThe Oilers should win plenty of games with their overpowered offense and upgraded defense, but who is going to be in the crease for most of those wins? Skinner's ADP is very palatable, but you shouldn't completely count out Campbell at this stage. In fact, this might be an old school insurance scenario in which drafting Skinner means you should target Campbell in the final rounds to play it safe. There is value to be had here, as the Oilers are a 50-win team these days.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever!

When both Andersen and Raanta were hurt last season, Kochetkov had a chance to show he could do the job in net. But the rookie faded with his chances later in the season, ultimately leaving the Hurricanes to decide to re-sign both Andersen and Raanta on fairly short-term deals. Kochetkov, now 24, can be sent down to the AHL without risking waivers, so he'll be the No. 3 goaltender for the Canes this season.\nThen there's the Andersen or Raanta debate. Raanta was the better goaltender of the two last season, posting better ratios and almost as many wins in fewer starts, but we are only two years removed from when Andersen finished 24th overall in fantasy in 2021-22 with 3.85 FPP60.\nHealth will be the first and foremost concern, as Andersen and Raanta were both fragile last season and the season prior (recall that Andersen missed the 2021-22 playoffs). That said, the Hurricanes wouldn't invest in Andersen and Raanta again unless they thought one of them could be the guy for at least one more season with Kochetkov still waiver eligible. Andersen's ADP is actually trending low if he ends up getting the bulk of starts here, which is the most likely scenario.\nCam Talbot: 40.1% crease share, 587th overall, 1.57 FPP60 (with Ottawa Senators), 219.5 ADP\nPheonix Copley: 42.2% crease share, 351st overall, 2.56 FPP60, 230.2 ADP\nAs much as Copley saved the Kings from themselves last season, he apparently didn't do enough to get a clear shot at the starter's gig yet. Copley was a huge stabilizer for the Kings last season, winning twice as many games as anyone else on the roster. But his ratios weren't great and faded down the stretch. The Kings brought in Joonas Korpisalo at the trade deadline, but Korpisalo opted for the Ottawa Senators in the offseason. The natural choice from there? Sign the Senators goaltender from last season. Cam Talbot had a rough year, earning almost no fantasy value, and is now 36 years old. The age is a major concern, as Talbot is past the spot on the goaltender curve where they usually remain productive for fantasy. But Copley, adequate, wasn't exactly changing the game for fantasy managers in his 37 games last season.\nTalbot hasn't had as much wear and tear as some other 36-year-old goaltenders, spending a lot of his career as a backup. So there is a world in which he can pull out another solid season behind a solid squad. Copley doesn't have a lot of upside, so the ideal situation here is Talbot hanging on for another year of value and getting the bulk of starts. He's the one to take a chance on.\nVitek Vanecek: 59.0% crease share, 111th overall, 3.08 FPP60, 116.2 ADP\nAkira Schmid: 18.2% crease share, 574th overall, 3.48 FPP60, 228.4 ADP\nJordan Binnington: 71.4% crease share, 541st overall, 1.00 FPP60, 228.1 ADP\nJoel Hofer: 6.4% crease share, 805th overall, 2.16 FPP60, 230.0, ADP\nNeither of these teams look like they will have a tandem on paper. But Schmid and Hofer have both shown glimpses and are both 23 coming into the season, which is about the age goaltenders really start coming on. If you are drafting Vanecek, Schmid is a good idea to handcuff. You probably shouldn't be looking at Binnington for your crease, but Hofer has upside if he pushes for more time.\nReady to play?
