{"title": "Stewie is back, Aces advance: Biggest takeaways from the WNBA semifinals", "date": "", "text": "The Aces complete a sweep of the Wings with an 11-0 run to send Las Vegas to the WNBA Finals. (1:18)\nDALLAS -- The Las Vegas Aces are one step closer in their quest to repeat. The defending champions are returning to the WNBA Finals for the second consecutive season and the third time in four years after sweeping the Dallas Wings 3-0 in the semifinals, capped by Friday's 64-61 victory in Dallas. A'ja Wilson and her top-seeded Aces -- who have yet to drop a game in the postseason -- have earned a well-deserved break ahead of the Finals, which open Oct. 8 in Las Vegas.\n\"On our last defensive possession, our mindset was, 'We're good, we've got this. Let's just execute,'\" Wilson said as Las Vegas closed on an 11-0 run and didn't allow the Wings to score in the final 5 minutes. \"I just felt like we were so connected.\"\nBut which team will the Aces face as they try to become the league's first back-to-back champions since 2001-02? The No. 2 seed New York Liberty lead the third-seeded Connecticut Sun 2-1 in their semifinal series following a 92-81 Game 3 win Friday in Uncasville. New York seeks its first trip to the WNBA Finals since 2002, and is still looking for its first title.\nBut the Sun won't go down without a fight, especially on their home floor at Mohegan Sun Arena. Also in search of its first championship, Connecticut hopes to return to the Finals for the third time in five years, which would set up a rematch of last year's championship series.\nWe break down all of Friday's action and look ahead to Sunday's Game 4 when the Sun host the Liberty and attempt to stave off elimination (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App).\nBreanna Stewart drops 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Liberty take control of the series vs. the Sun.\nThe Liberty had their best quarter of basketball in awhile when they jumped to a 37-16 lead at the end of the first period Friday, shooting 62.5% while holding Connecticut to 38.9%. Breanna Stewart found her shot in the first frame before finishing with better than 36% shooting for the first time this postseason (11-for-19 from the field, 1-for-3 from 3).\nBut the Sun outplayed the Liberty most of the rest of the way, outscoring New York by 11 across the final 30 minutes. If you're Sun coach Stephanie White, that's an encouraging sign.\nAnd it's also an indication for how critical Rebecca Allen -- out with a non-COVID illness -- is to the Sun. Connecticut really missed her impact defensively, as well as her ability to knock down 3-pointers, stretch the floor and all the intangibles she brings as a veteran.\nThe Liberty won by their second-largest margin of the postseason, but the Sun are very much still in this series, especially if Allen is able to play Sunday. -- Philippou\nLas Vegas coach Becky Hammon has stressed defense over and over since the season started. Sure, the Aces can be an offensive machine the likes of few teams in WNBA history. But Hammon knew they had to improve defensively to win another title. Friday's game showed that.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Lowe: Breaking down the Lillard trade »\n• QB Hot Board for 2024 NFL draft »\n• What's real in international soccer »\n More ESPN+ content »\nThe Aces' 64 points was the franchise's lowest total in a playoff win. They had 20 turnovers -- including a late pass that sailed out of bounds from normally sure-handed point guard Chelsea Gray, who referred to it as, \"Throwing it in the ocean\" -- tying the most they've had in any game since Hammon took over as coach ahead of last season.\nBut the Aces still won.\nThe Wings were 0-of-8 from the field in clutch time, which is defined as when a game is within five points with five or fewer minutes left in regulation/overtime. That is the worst clutch shooting in the playoffs.\n\"Last year, we were a bit of an anomaly; people are used to our actions now,\" Hammon said. \"In fact, they're running some of our actions now. So I knew it was going to come down to improving defense.\" -- Voepel\nFor Connecticut, a healthy Allen would help a lot. The Sun also need to get back to their defensive strengths and derive their energy from that end of the floor. Allowing New York to score 50 points in the paint isn't going to cut it. The Sun's ability to keep the Liberty out of their transition game remains crucial.\nCan New York come through with the energy and focus to ward off what'll likely be a ferocious Sun effort to force a Game 5? No doubt the Liberty will try to avoid having this series return to Brooklyn and into a winner-take-all scenario.\nAnother strong shooting night from Stewart would help, but as Game 3 showed, Betnijah Laney is the Liberty's X factor: She's scored at least 19 points in four of New York's five postseason games (she was held to three points in the 15-point Game 1 loss to Connecticut). The Liberty were 16-2 when Laney scored at least 14 points in the regular season. In other words, New York goes as she goes. -- Philippou\nAs was the case between the first round and the semifinals, the Aces will have over a week to prepare for the Finals. They will look to sharpen some things on offense, especially after all the turnovers Friday.\nBut resting is one of the biggest points of emphasis. Hammon said Aces center Kiah Stokes was \"absolutely exhausted\" by the end of Friday's contest after facing the Wings inside.\n\"We're going to sit back and watch [the Liberty and the Sun] battle it out,\" Hammon said. \"We're happy to be back [in the Finals]. I told them their care factor for each other is a separation factor. It's something I get to see daily. They dug in like they always do.\" -- Voepel\nESPN Stats & Information contributed to this report."}

The American team's seven-point deficit matches the biggest after three sessions in the five-session format. U.S. squads led by seven after three sessions in 1967 and 1975.\nAfter failing to capture a match on the opening day and falling behind the European team 6 ½ - 1 ½ on Friday, the Americans finally won in Saturday morning's foursome (alternate shot) matches. Open Championship winner Brian Harman and Max Homa delivered the squad's first full point with a 4 & 2 victory over Ireland's Shane Lowry and Austria's Sepp Straka.\nHarman and Homa combined to make five birdies and two eagles, including one on the 16th that closed out that match, when Harman nearly drove the green and Homa chipped in from 39 feet.\n\"We needed something to go our way,\" Homa said. \"I felt like we were ready this morning. We were ready to come out and play some great golf which we did. Somebody had to start a spark, so I'm just glad it was us. We obviously are in a big hole, but we have the right guys to dig ourselves out of it.\"\nNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and England's Tommy Fleetwood delivered another point for the Europeans when they took down Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, 2 & 1, in the top match. At least the U.S. pair showed some fight. Spieth and Thomas dropped each of the first three holes but rallied to only 1 down on the 16th.\nSpain's Jon Rahm and England's Tyrrell Hatton held off Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele 2 & 1 to win the final match of the morning. The American pair was 3 down after eight holes but rallied to tie the match at No. 14. But then Schauffele missed birdie putts of 6 ½ feet on No. 16 and 3 ½ feet on No. 17, giving the Europeans another win. Europe went 7-1 in foursomes matches.\n\"Yesterday was an amazing day and we wanted to enjoy it because it's not very often you go out on a full day in a Ryder Cup and don't lose a full point,\" McIlroy said. \"We enjoyed last night but at the same time we knew the Americans were going to be hurting a bit and they obviously want to get off to a fast start this morning, and our objective is to just not let them do that.\"\nThe story of Saturday morning was the domination of the European team's new star pairing: Hovland, the reigning FedEx Cup champion, and Aberg, who competed at Texas Tech this past season and didn't turn pro until June.\nThe European tandem won each of the first four holes against Koepka and Scheffler. They were 5 up after seven and then took each of the next four holes to end the match. The Americans didn't win a hole. The U.S. pair carded a 5-over 40 on the front nine; the Europeans posted a 4-under 31. The match lasted just two hours, 19 minutes and didn't make it to the 12th hole.\nIt was the largest margin of victory in an 18-hole match of any format at the Ryder Cup, which was first played in 1927. The previous most lopsided defeat in an 18-hole match was 8 & 7, which occurred twice in singles, most recently by current U.S. team vice-captain Fred Couples over Ian Woosnam in 1997.\nThe previous worst loss in a foursomes match was 7 & 6, which happened three times, most recently by Americans Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson over current European team captain Luke Donald and Lee Westwood in 2012."}

(1:17)\nThe San Francisco Giants fired manager Gabe Kapler on Friday after a late-season collapse that dropped the team out of playoff contention and prompted questions about the franchise's direction going forward.\nThe firing comes with three games remaining in the season and the Giants sporting a 78-81 record. In a statement, Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi said he made the \"recommendation to ownership\" to fire Kapler and then did so after \"receiving their approval.\"\nKai Correa will manage the Giants' last three games.\nKapler, 48, took over as Giants manager in 2020, and by 2021 shepherded the club to a 107-55 season -- the only time in the past 11 years a team finished ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West. The Dodgers beat the Giants in the division series that year, and San Francisco struggled to replicate its success last season en route to an 81-81 record.\nWhile owner Greg Johnson had committed to keeping Zaidi and Kapler on through at least the end of their contracts in 2024, he backtracked on Kapler, opening up another managerial spot in a winter that's expected to be loaded with vacancies.\nCleveland's Terry Francona will retire after this weekend, and the statuses of Milwaukee's Craig Counsell, Houston's Dusty Baker and the Los Angeles Angels' Phil Nevin -- whose contracts are expiring -- as well as the New York Mets' Buck Showalter and San Diego's Bob Melvin remain in question.\nIn the days after the All-Star break, the Giants looked well on their way to a rebound. They were a season-high 13 games over .500 and just 1½ games back of the Dodgers. Since July 18, San Francisco's 24-40 record is the second-worst in the NL, and the Giants have fallen behind the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Padres in the standings.\nA late-season swoon put an end to the Giants' playoff chances and brought about the end of Gabe Kapler's tenure in San Francisco.\nThe frustration burbled toward the surface in recent weeks, as the Giants wrapped up a September in which they sport an 8-17 record. Ace Logan Webb, who is 11-13 this season despite leading the NL in innings pitched and strikeout-to-walk ratio, said this week: \"I'm tired of losing. It's not enjoyable. It's not fun. We have to make some big changes in here to create that winning culture that we want to show up every single year and try to win the whole thing.\"\nZaidi said Friday that the Giants played their \"worst baseball when it mattered the most.\"\n\"To go out on that last road trip still in the wild card, still controlling our own destiny and then playing the way we did when we controlled our own destiny, those are hard to watch for everybody,\" Zaidi said. \"It was hard for the players to go through, it was hard for fans to watch, it was hard for us as an organization to watch. That sort of really accelerated our view that we need to make difficult decisions and think about things differently.\"\nWith only $110 million committed to their payroll in 2024 -- and just $45 million in 2025 -- the Giants are expected to be players in free agency this winter, including targeting superstar Shohei Ohtani."}

{"title": "Seahawks' Adams considered retiring after injury", "date": "", "text": "Seahawks safety Jamal Adams opens up about the difficulties he faced after tearing his left quadriceps tendon in the 2022 season opener. (1:30)\nRENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks safety Jamal Adams, who's set to make his 2023 debut Monday night against the New York Giants, revealed that he briefly but legitimately considered retiring in the immediate aftermath of the serious leg injury he suffered in last season's opener.\nSpeaking to reporters Friday for the first time since tearing his left quadriceps tendon, a candid and introspective Adams recalled bawling in the locker room when he got the news that his season was over, and how he found himself in a \"dark place\" as a result.\n\"It was tough,\" he said. \"I thought about retiring. I thought about a lot of things. Is this going to be it for me? I didn't know. But I knew eventually, after I got that MRI, I told myself I'm going to be back. I didn't know when or how, but I was going to figure it out.\"\nAsked why retirement was a consideration, the 27-year-old Adams pointed to all the injuries he's suffered over the last three seasons and the toll they've taken on him mentally. In addition to his torn quad tendon -- which connects the quad muscle to the kneecap -- Adams has suffered two torn shoulder labrums as well as less significant injuries to his groin, elbow and fingers.\nAfter missing only two games over his first three seasons with the New York Jets, he's missed 28 of a possible 53 regular-season games since the Seahawks acquired him in a blockbuster trade with the New York Jets in 2020.\n\"I was having all types of thoughts running through my mind, but at the time when I did tear my knee, that was definitely something I was considering,\" said Adams, who has three seasons and $45 million remaining on the $70 million extension he signed in 2021. \"I was considering everything at the moment. I was in a dark place. Not on anything suicidal, but definitely in a lot of dark times as far as getting away from the game of football, getting away from people. At the time I wasn't really talking to many people, wasn't answering my phone. So you go through real life situations in this game of football.\"\nReturning in Week 4 against the Giants was Adams' goal all along. Knowing his recovery would sideline him well into the summer and prevent him from playing in the preseason, he figured he'd need at least three weeks of practice during the regular season to get game ready.\nMonday night's game will also mark his first time playing at MetLife Stadium since he was traded.\n\"Obviously it's a special place for me,\" he said, \"being back in New York and being back home.\"\nAdams was activated off the PUP list on Aug. 24 but only took part in walk-throughs until he returned to practice in Week 2. The Seahawks listed him as a full participant Thursday and Friday.\nCoach Pete Carroll said at the start of the week that Adams would have no restrictions. But when asked if the Seahawks will have to limit his snaps in his first game in over a year, defensive coordinator Clint Hurtt said they'll feel that out as they go.\nAdams' injury occurred in the first half of the 2022 opener when he planted his left foot while reaching for a scrambling Russell Wilson.\n\"Just getting up and knowing that it's not attached, it was devastating,\" he said. \"I walked off -- or I tried to run off as best I could, but I knew something was wrong when I got to the sideline and I seen my kneecap to the right of my knee. They told me the news. That was hard. That was a low moment for me, man.\"\nAdams had surgery a week later and had to spend more than 20 weeks in a straight cast. During that time, he needed assistance to perform routine tasks like getting out of bed, using the bathroom and taking a shower.\n\"I couldn't do anything by myself,\" he said.\nMonday night's game will mark the unveiling of the Seahawks' plan to get Adams back to his 2020 form. That year, he set the single-season record for sacks by a defensive back with 9.5 in 12 games. He didn't have a sack in 12 games in 2021, then played less than a half before he went down in last year's opener.\n\"I haven't hit anybody in a long time,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to it, man, I'll tell you that. I won't take a play for granted. I won't take a moment or a second for granted. Just to be able to fly on a plane with my teammates is going to be big for me. Just to be able to come up here and speak is big for me. Just to be able to sit down in the seats when Pete's up here in team meetings is big for me. I wasn't able to sit down in a seat for 20-plus weeks, so it's a real humbling experience that I went through.\n\"My mindset is a lot sharper. The details of what I went through, nobody could honestly understand unless you've been through it. It's definitely something that I don't wish on anybody, but I made it out. I'm just looking forward to the journey. I'm looking forward to the season. I'm excited to be back.\""}

(0:58)\nEach of the Power 5 conferences enter Week 5 of the college football season with three or more unbeaten teams. There will be at least one fewer in the Big 12 after Saturday, when No. 24 Kansas travels to No. 3 Texas.\nThat's not to say the rest of the teams without a defeat will get out of the weekend unscathed. No. 8 USC is on the road at once-beaten Colorado, No. 17 Duke hosts No. 11 Notre Dame, and unranked but unbeaten Syracuse gets a test at home against Clemson.\nOur reporters preview Week 5 with a look at teams that will give us a reality check, receivers to watch and some of the week's best quotes.\nSyracuse: There are six undefeated teams in the ACC, but two remain unranked: Syracuse and Louisville. Considering that fact alone, it is fair to question whether both are for real. But let us focus on Syracuse for just a moment, since the Orange host Clemson on Saturday (noon ET, ABC).\nSyracuse has given the Tigers fits over the past few years, with little to show for it. Last year, the Orange went into Clemson undefeated at 6-0 and led 21-10 heading into the fourth quarter. But they lost 27-21, then dropped their next four.\nIn 2021, Syracuse missed a game-tying field goal in the final seconds. Four of the previous six meetings were decided by fewer than seven points, but Syracuse won only one of them -- in 2017.\nGoing into the matchup this year, Syracuse is 4-0; Clemson is 2-2. Garrett Shrader has put up big numbers at quarterback, ranking No. 2 in the ACC in total offense behind Drake Maye at North Carolina, and he has done it without his top receiver in Oronde Gadsden II (out for the season).\nBut there is no going around the nonconference schedule Syracuse just played to start 4-0: one FCS win, two Group of 5 wins, one Power 5 win. The three FBS teams the Orange beat are a combined 4-8. None has a winning record.\nClemson is coming off a tough overtime loss to Florida State and is 0-2 for the first time in ACC play since 2010, so there is opportunity for Syracuse to show Saturday that it is, in fact, \"for real.\" Especially with two more games after Clemson that will test their mettle -- at No. 14 North Carolina (4-0) and at No. 5 Florida State (4-0) -- Andrea Adelson\nKansas: The tired \"Is Texas back?\" debate can wait. Let's look at these Jayhawks.\nKansas landed at No. 24 in this week's AP poll, being ranked in consecutive seasons for the first time since 2007-09. They've started 4-0 in back-to-back seasons for the first time since they did it from 1913 to 1915.\nThe Jayhawks' offense is a huge reason. They have scored 30 or more points in five straight games, also the longest streak since 2009. Quarterback Jalon Daniels had another three-touchdown game last week against BYU, his sixth since 2021, second only to former TCU QB Max Duggan in the Big 12 over that span. Daniels was the preseason Big 12 offensive player of the year and running back Devin Neal was a preseason first-team pick as well. The league respects the Jayhawks, and at 37.8 points per game, they should.\nThe defense is holding up well, including two touchdowns last week and seven turnovers on the season.\nBut the Jayhawks' offense will have its hands full with the Texas defense, which is first in the country in red zone touchdown percentage allowed (10%).\nTwo years ago, Daniels pulled off a 57-56 upset over the Longhorns in Austin. Last year, however, Texas lowered the boom with a 55-14 payback. Kansas coach Lance Leipold knows this Longhorns team is more like the one last year than the one he saw two years ago.\n\"Tough kids,\" Leipold said this week. \"It's definitely a different team and a huge challenge for us and one that we've got to have our best week of preparation yet.\" -- Dave Wilson\nMichigan: ​​The Wolverines are ranked No. 2 the country, but the knock on them has been the strength of schedule, so it has been difficult to gauge just how good this team is. Michigan beat Rutgers 31-7, which is the best win to date this season. The Wolverines play their first game away from Ann Arbor on Saturday when they play at Nebraska (3:30 p.m. ET, Fox)\nYes, it has been a lackluster schedule thus far, but the Michigan defense has not given up more than seven points in any of its first four games. The offense has been more balanced than we have seen in years past with J.J. McCarthy at quarterback. When the running game isn't making big plays, McCarthy and the receivers have been there to pick the offense up -- not something we had fully seen from this team last season. So, while it won't truly be tested until November, when Michigan plays Penn State and Ohio State, this is still a very good team that has handled business up to this point.\nOpposing defenses can no longer just stack the box and try to take the run away, as McCarthy has shown accuracy and good decision-making this season. Receiver Roman Wilson has six receiving touchdowns through four games, and McCarthy has thrown for 915 yards and eight touchdowns. The combination of a balanced offense and restricting defense makes Michigan one of the best teams in the country. -- Tom VanHaaren\nUtah: Some coaches have earned the benefit of the doubt; some have not. It's a simple concept: If a coach has a track record of success, there is a presumption that success will continue until it's obvious that's not the case.\nThat's a large part of why I picked Utah to win the Pac-12 in the preseason. Kyle Whittingham earned it. Plus, the Utes are the two-time defending conference champions and the quarterback who led them to those titles, Cam Rising, said in July he would be ready for the opener.\nBut with new information comes the obligation to reevaluate. After four games, Utah looks more like a team hanging on than it does a team that's a real threat to three-peat. It's a strange sentiment considering the Utes have three Power 5 wins -- Florida, Baylor and then-No. 22 UCLA -- but in a conference that has one of the best collections of quarterbacks in the history of college football, the offensive struggles feel too significant to overcome. Yes, the Utes have been incredible on defense (No. 6 nationally in scoring), but only three Power 5 offenses are averaging fewer yards per play than the Utes (4.89). It's not a sustainable winning formula.\nThe wild card is Rising, who has yet to play. If his return -- maybe this week against Oregon State on Friday (9 p.m. ET, Fox Sports1)? -- transforms things, then, sure, Utah remains a player. But if his return keeps getting delayed or the offense doesn't improve significantly upon his return, expect Utah to fade. -- Kyle Bonagura\nKentucky: Had even the most pessimistic of Kentucky football fans surveyed the schedule back in August, they would have confidently placed the Wildcats right where they are at this point -- 4-0. It's difficult to find a cushier start to the 2023 season (Michigan would be in the running) than what Kentucky has faced in playing Ball State, Eastern Kentucky, Akron and Vanderbilt. And against FCS foe Eastern Kentucky in Week 2, Kentucky was anything but sharp.\nNone of that matters now, as Kentucky gets into the teeth of its schedule with No. 22 Florida visiting Kroger Field on Saturday (noon ET, ESPN). It's the start of a stretch where Kentucky plays three of its next four games at home.\nThere was a time when the mention of Florida inside the hallways of the Kentucky football complex would have elicited shivers. But not anymore. The Wildcats have won three of the past five matchups in this series, yet another example of the job Mark Stoops -- in his 11th season -- has done in building the Kentucky program from the ashes.\nBefore this recent success, Kentucky had lost 31 straight games to Florida. And if the Wildcats can get it done again, it would be only their fourth 5-0 start to the season in the last four-plus decades. Stoops engineered two of them. Kentucky started 6-0 in 2021 on its way to 10 wins and started 5-0 in 2018 en route to winning 10 games.\nParticularly in light of last season's 7-6 finish, this is a chance for the Wildcats to show they belong in the SEC's upper echelon. This team very much has a Stoops feel to it. The defense is fourth in the SEC in scoring (15.5 points per game), and they're tied for first with eight forced turnovers.\nEach of their top two running backs are averaging more than 6 yards per carry, and transfer quarterback Devin Leary has one of the deepest fleet of explosive receivers UK has had in a while. Tayvion Robinson has blossomed with Liam Coen back as offensive coordinator.\nIn short, what's missing for Kentucky this season is a complete game against a nationally ranked team. The Wildcats get their shot Saturday. -- Chris Low\nACC: One of the brightest spots at Virginia this season has been receiver Malik Washington, who has emerged as one of the best players in the ACC. A transfer from Northwestern, Washington leads all ACC receivers in receptions (28) and receiving yards (459). Last week against NC State, Washington had 10 receptions for 170 yards and two touchdowns. He now has three straight 100-yard receiving games, just the third Virginia player to ever do that. Nobody in Virginia history has ever recorded four straight 100-yard receiving games, but Washington will get his chance Saturday against Boston College (2 p.m. ET, CW Network). -- Adelson\nBig 12: UCF's Kobe Hudson is off to a hot start in 2023, averaging 115.8 yards per game, and his 463 yards are 60 more than the next-closest Big 12 receiver (Samuel Brown of Houston). Hudson, a 6-1, 200-pound Georgia native who was Auburn's leading receiver in 2021 before transferring to UCF, already has three 100-yard games, including 138 yards and two touchdowns in the Knights' Big 12 opener, a 44-31 loss at defending Big 12 champs Kansas State last week. He'll be a focus of the offense in the Knights' first Big 12 home game, Saturday against Baylor (3:30 p.m. ET, Fox Sports1). -- Wilson\nBig Ten: Senior wideout Bryce Kirtz was one of the heroes for Northwestern in its come-from-behind 37-34 OT victory over Minnesota last week, having a career day with 10 receptions for 215 yards and two scores. With No. 6 Penn State coming to town Saturday (noon ET, Big Ten Network) and the Wildcats searching for consecutive Big Ten wins for the first time since 2020, Ben Bryant will certainly throw in the direction of Kirtz, who's sixth in the conference with 274 receiving yards. -- Blake Baumgartner\nPac-12: Despite Caleb Williams' willingness to spread the ball around, USC's Brenden Rice has emerged as Williams' top target, especially when it comes to deep balls and touchdowns. Through four games, the 6-foot-3, 210-pound Rice has four touchdowns, including one of 75 yards and another of 43. The son of Hall of Famer Jerry Rice is averaging just over 21 yards a catch so far this season and looks primed to become the top scorer for the Trojans on offense should this trend continue. -- Paolo Uggetti\nSEC: The bad news for South Carolina is Juice Wells is out for the Tennessee game (7:30 p.m. ET, SEC Network), but Xavier Legette has been one of the best receivers in the country through four games and just keeps getting better. The 6-3, 227-pound Legette leads the country with an average of 139 receiving yards per game and is averaging 20.6 yards per catch. He had two touchdowns last week in the win over Mississippi State, and while he has great size, he also has elite speed. On his 76-yard touchdown reception against Mississippi State, Legette topped out at 22.3 mph. -- Low\nMark Stoops: While some coaches might worry about how a noon ET kickoff affects the crowd, the Kentucky coach has faith in the Wildcats' fans showing up for Saturday's game against Florida.\n\"I have great confidence in the people of Kentucky that can get up very early and pound some beers. Why would you disrespect this great state and the great people of it?\"\nHugh Freeze: Auburn's coach would just as soon not talk about beating the Tigers' oldest rival, Georgia (it dates back to 1892), in a hateful way, but rather in a positive light.\n\"I'm not big on hate. I'm really not. I'm big on just, man, this means something to so many people. So we should compete in a way out of love for our people, not necessarily for hate for other people.\"\nDabo Swinney: Despite Clemson's 2-2 start, the Tigers coach has been impressed with his team's play.\n\"They're not perfect, but they are playing the right way. We'll get through this. Honestly, I've had a bunch of 4-0 teams around here that haven't played as well as this group.\"\nMike Elko: The Duke coach knew his Blue Devils would be good, but even he didn't know they'd be this good, this fast.\n\"I did not take the job with the hope and expectation that we could be a middle-of-the-road program. That's not who I am. Did I anticipate in Game 5 of Year 2, that we would be on this stage? No, of course not. That is a credit to our kids, and what they bought into and how hard they've worked. What it's doing is it's allowing us to expedite the process of building the brand of football to the level that we hope that we could get to.\""}
{"title": "Love him or hate him, Deion Sanders isn't slowing down -- not even after a blowout loss", "date": "", "text": "Deion Sanders tells ESPN's Ryan McGee at a news conference that he doesn't listen to outside noise. (1:10)\nBOULDER, Col. -- Deion Sanders does not need to coach football.\nIt's true. He doesn't. He has money in the bank and did long before he signed his current $6-million-per-year contract with the University of Colorado. If he wanted, he could go back to being a television analyst. He could write another book. He could star in another reality show. He could do like every other living sports legend and cash in on memorabilia shows every weekend, signing Falcons, Niners, Cowboys, Braves and Yankees jerseys, one of his six Sports Illustrated covers or maybe one of the CDs recorded with MC Hammer back in the day.\nBut instead, he has chosen to keep plowing on what is perhaps the most difficult and certainly the most nonstop round-the-clock-and-calendar job in collegiate athletics, the head coach of a publicly backed state flagship FBS Power 5 university football program.\n\"People ask me all the time, 'How you doing, man?' and my answer is simple,\" the 56-year old College Football Hall of Famer explains. \"I'm doing great. I just ain't sleeping because in this job there's no time for sleep.\"\nIn only one month on the sidelines at Colorado, Sanders has not only served as de facto CEO of a nearly $51 million corporation (that was prior to his arrival, the 2023 numbers will be much larger than that) he has become the front porch salesman of a $21 billion university, been involved in one very public spat with a rival coach (and nearly pushed into another), spurred an almost 900 percent increase in Buffaloes merchandise sales and generated the highest college football TV ratings for ABC in six years.\nCall him Prime Time. Call him Neon Deion. Call him Coach Prime. No matter what nickname you prefer, monikers and catch phrases on t-shirts (Sanders applied for five trademarks just this week) have all become little more than garnish for this latest iteration of the man who electrified Florida State as a three-sport athlete in the 1980's and put the same charge into the NFL and MLB in the '90s. Now, nearly two decades after hanging up his cleats for good, he is the face of college football in 2023. The man who could have cashed in on NIL like perhaps no other before or since. The man who could have teleported onto any roster of his choosing via the transfer portal. Now, he is the man who is helping today's kids navigate it all. Prime Time at exactly the right time.\nOh, by the way, his team is also 3-1. Even with a completely overhauled roster, that is a miraculous about-face for a program that won only one game and was ESPN's runaway Bottom 10 champion one year ago. However, after a stunning 3-0 start, that \"1\" was dropped like an anvil on Wile E. Coyote's head last weekend. A 42-6 loss at Oregon immediately herded the Buffs out of the Top 25 and brought in those who have been barking at Sanders since the days of big hair and Zubaz.\n\"When I came out the womb I was booed,\" Sanders said Tuesday when asked how he deals with haters. \"I don't have a message for detractors. I don't take my time to respond and to defend myself. Why would I do that? I'm giving you a microphone if I'm doing that. I'm giving you solace that you're in my life. I don't care. I really don't. It's been that way all my life, so you would think that I'm used to it. I'm not new to this, I'm true to this. And I'm going to keep going. So, I'm good with that, man. I'm good with that. This is a comfortable place for me.\"\nNow, for you youngsters out there, it feels like you're owed an explanation. You have likely spent the last month, at the very least that last quote, wondering, \"Why are my parents and grandparents so worked up -- good and bad -- about this dude coaching at Colorado?\"\nThe answer can be found a few paragraphs ago. Sanders as a Seminole was the guy who stood face mask to face mask with Jimmy Johnson's Miami Hurricanes and didn't blink. He once dug in his heels at the base of Clemson's Hill like Captain America facing the entire Thanos army, slapping his chest pad and taunting the Tigers as they touched Howard's Rock and ran toward him...then broke off a 77-yard punt return for a TD in torrential rain. He won conference championships in baseball and track on the same day.\nHe played in the Super Bowl and the World Series, the only man to do so. He collected two Super Bowl rings, eight Pro Bowl invites and an NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. He did indeed record an album with MC Hammer (download \"Must Be The Money,\" trust me) and made cameos on everything from Moesha to Walker, Texas Ranger. He was the voice of Sega Genesis football. And everyone's Sunday evening on the couch was spent watching a show that shared his name, NFL Prime Time, on ESPN when Chris Berman and Tom Jackson would narrate the video of every Sanders interception, pick-six, kick return and TD catch (yes, he played both ways from time to time) with a chant of \"Prime Time...Prime Time...PRIME TIME!\"\nSo, yeah, Gen Z, what your elders are trying to tell you, whether they are high stepping through the living room or pointing a middle finger at College GameDay in Boulder, is that Deion Sanders somehow went viral before the internet was a thing, when that term still only applied to diseases.\nBut now, Sanders finds himself battling his own medical conditions. His toes were already mangled from all those years running up and down sidelines and baselines. In September 2021, after a routine procedure to fix those old injuries, a much worse condition was discovered, circulation problems that led to the amputation of two toes and the removal of some leg muscle tissue to limit the circulation damage. He had just started his second season as head coach at Jackson State, an HBCU in Jackson, Mississippi, and was forced to miss three games. When TV cameras aired the images of a suddenly old-looking Neon Deion, stuck in a hospital bed with a full gray beard, it was downright shocking to those who had witnessed him at the height of his athletic superpowers.\nFor Sanders, it was also revelatory.\n\"When your body breaks down, it is a reality check like no other,\" he recalled in December 2022, days after accepting the Colorado job. \"For anyone, it is a reality check. But for me, who as a younger man made my whole world from what this body could do, that was more than a reality check. That was a vulnerability check. As you get older, you know you have to rely more on the muscle of the mind, but when your other muscles don't work for you anymore, the need to work that mind muscle, you realize you need to get on with that. Start impacting lives with that.\"\nThat he had taken the job at Jackson State was already a step no one saw coming, explained by Sanders only as \"a collect call from God of which I had no choice but to accept the charges.\" His first Tigers team went 3-2 in the pandemic-shortened spring schedule of 2021. The next two years it went 23-3 with a pair of Celebration Bowl appearances.\n\"What I will always remember about Deion at Jackson State is him out there cutting the grass on his own lawn mower that he brought from home,\" recalls Emmitt Smith, who played against Sanders in college as a Florida Gator and with him as a Dallas Cowboys teammate. \"That's him, man. I think it is easy to focus on Prime Time and the show and the soundbites, but you don't get to where he has been without working so hard. I know what people saw him do at an HBCU made people think, should I have gone there? I know I did. And I know Deion did. Now new kids will.\"\nSmith, and nearly every other former teammate of No. 21, love to talk about the Deion Sanders evolution. See: The infamous story about Sanders when he arrived in Dallas in 1995, as described by Jeff Pearlman in his 2008 book \"Boys Will Be Boys.\" Sanders frustrated defensive coordinator Dave Campo their very first time together in a position meeting room by pointing to the video screen and saying, \"Hey, Coach, I got that dude right there. Wherever he goes, I go. All that Cover 2 stuff you're talking about, y'all work that out.\"\nThat guy who was once allergic to film study, now keeps real-time spreadsheets on how much time his players spend watching film. He explained that on Tuesday, within the context of a question about freshman corner Cormani McClain's lack of playing time, despite being Colorado's most-ballyhooed offseason signee, a five-star prospect who flipped from Miami.\n\"Study and prepare. Be on time for meetings, show up to the dern meetings,\" Sanders said. 'Understand the scheme. Understand what we are doing as a scheme, want to play this game, desire to play this game, desire to be the best in this game, at practice, in the film room and on your own time. You do know I check film time from each player so I can see who's preparing? That's not just about Cormani. If I don't see that, you would be a fool to put somebody out there who's not prepared. Can't do it, won't do it.\"\nAgain, it's Sanders, so social media and local sports talk radio immediately became a tug of war between those ripping the coach for calling a kid out publicly (and not for the first time) and those who applauded Sanders for calling out a five-star and doing so without fear of alienating potential future signees.\nThe reality is McClain might have to play against No. 8 USC on Saturday because Colorado's secondary is banged up. The latest to suffer is also a Sanders. The middle of Deion's five children, safety Shilo Sanders had to be hospitalized due to urinating blood upon the team's return home from Oregon. Younger brother Shedeur is the team's quarterback, little sister Shelomi is on the Colorado women's basketball team, and they are all documented by big brother Deion Jr., the man behind the camera of all those viral Colorado athletic department social media posts this season.\n\"Even though we got the 'L' (against Oregon) I don't consider it a loss when I get to watch my sons not only play on the field, I get to watch my son film everything and edit it and put it out and make people insecure around the country about their staffs, and then I get to see my daughter come in my office and take a nap on the couch,\" Sanders said Tuesday. \"I'm living a wonderful double life here as a father and coach. I'm loving every minute of it.\"\nSo, what does a 56-year-old lifelong lightning rod teach to a house and locker room full of Gen Z'ers who are new to all the noise that continuously rolls over Colorado football like, well, a boulder? It's the luxury tax one must pay when they become the new Georgetown Hoyas, Fab Five or -- sorry FSU fans -- The U.\n\"It's not about them, it's about us, everywhere we go,\" he explained Tuesday. \"Even in your families you're going to have detractors, naysayers, you have doubters even in your dern family. You guys are all shaking your heads, like, 'Yeah, my aunt, she ain't no good,' and, 'Yeah, my sister, she's ignorant.' You know I'm telling the truth. Because it's going to be like that. God would always allow somebody to be in your path that has a disdain or dislike for you. It's up to you to keep going.\"\nAnd there it is. Our answer. Because, no, Deion Sanders does not need to coach football. Honestly, Prime Time wouldn't have wanted to. He wasn't patient enough. We learned that during some of his pre-coaching educational and business failings.\nBut this is Coach Prime. The one with the grey hairs, the bad feet, the constant cautionary tales and all those catch phrases. Neon Deion made mistakes. Coach Prime wants to make sure these kids, especially his own, don't do the same. You can love Deion Sanders. You can hate Deion Sanders. Plenty do, always have and always will. But his efforts are inarguably admirable, his words are always honest and the college football world is a hell of a lot more interesting with him in it. He knows that. That's why he can't walk away.\nAlso, winning football games is still fun.\n\"I don't stop. I keep going. I don't have stop in me. Not whatsoever, man.\""}
{"title": "Lane Kiffin, an airport tarmac and the long-term impact of college football's most memorable firing", "date": "", "text": "For as long as there's been college football, coaches have been getting fired. The annual discussions about who's on the hot seat is as much a part of the game as a depth chart. But in the history of the sport -- perhaps the history of employment -- only one man's termination is universally recalled with just a single word: \"Tarmac.\"\nIt's been 10 years since Lane Kiffin was fired as USC's coach, supposedly on the tarmac at LAX. The truth of what happened in the early-morning hours of Sept. 29, 2013, is, like so many things with Kiffin, a bit more complicated.\nESPN spoke to nearly two dozen people who witnessed Kiffin's tenure at USC, as well as his unlikely second act as one of college football's most colorful characters and brilliant offensive minds, in an effort to find out what really happened that night and how it changed the rest of his career.\nLane Kiffin, USC head coach 2010-2013\nIt was a dream job for as long as I can remember to be a major college football coach so you could be somewhere forever, like the Bobby Bowden thing.\nKiffin grew up around the game. His father, Monte, is recognized as one of the great defensive coaches in football history, but Lane's genius is offense. His first full-time job came with USC in 2001, and he was on the sideline for the Trojans' rise to the top of college football under Pete Carroll. He was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2005, and two years later, at just 31 years old, was named head coach of the then Oakland Raiders.\nRaiders owner Al Davis fired Kiffin after two seasons amid much controversy. Davis held a news conference, complete with an overhead projector, and called Kiffin a \"disgrace to the organization.\" In 2009, Kiffin was hired as the head coach at Tennessee, and he immediately made waves in the stoic SEC with his brash demeanor and aggressive recruiting style.\nAt the end of the 2009 season, however, Carroll resigned at USC to take the head-coaching job with the Seattle Seahawks. The Trojans were eager to maintain the Carroll lineage, and set their sights on Kiffin.\n Mike Garrett, USC AD, 1993-2010\nI thought he was a student of the game, and I thought I had a maven in the works. I asked him to bring his father in, Monte. I thought Lane, offensively, could handle the load on that side of the ball, and Monte would handle the defensive side, and what a combination that would be.\n Scott Wolf, USC beat reporter\nThey never would've hired him at SC except he made this pitch to them that he was bringing Monte Kiffin, who they thought was the best defensive coordinator in the country, and Ed Orgeron, who was a beloved figure at SC. That's how he got the job.\n Mike Locksley, Alabama assistant, 2016-2018\nThe one thing Lane never got credit for was, he's a good coach. He's one of the better playcallers I've been around. A lot of that gets lost because he had this looming shadow of one of the great D-coordinators and great people in Monte Kiffin, so a lot of people labeled him as the kid who got everything off his last name.\n Clay Helton, USC assistant coach/head coach, 2010-2021\nYou could see how brilliant [Kiffin] was as an offensive mind, and he had a reputation as being an unbelievable recruiter. He already had Coach Orgeron on board, who is one of the best recruiters in football. ... [Orgeron] would take me on the road recruiting with him all the time. You'd get in the car with him and he'd give you a Red Bull, a pack of peanuts and a beef jerky. That was your day of rationing, and he went from daylight to dark recruiting everybody -- the principal, the counselor, the janitor at the school.\n Dan Weber, former USC beat reporter\nUSC football was about as big as you could possibly be, and the town was L.A. You'd go to practice and Will Ferrell was there all the time. You'd have to fight your way into practice because Snoop Dogg's bodyguards would be at the gate. I'd park and there'd be Sylvester Stallone in his Mercedes that was like 40-feet long.\n Garrett\nI loved [Kiffin's] brashness. I loved the fact he had a lot of confidence. You could call it arrogance, being young and thought he could change the world, but I kind of liked that. I thought it was something that could work to his advantage.\n Roy Nwaisser, Trojans super fan \"USC Psycho\"\nWhen Lane Kiffin came to USC, there was some baggage. He kept moving up despite failures. But USC fans were super excited because he was part of the Pete Carroll coaching tree.\n Tim Tessalone, former USC sports information director\nI loved Kiff. Did he have his quirks? Certainly did. But he was just kind of an introvert. A lot of people's perceptions of Kiff came from just that. He had a hard time engaging with people back then.\nWolf\nPat Haden told him not to do anything to get on the ticker at ESPN. That was the advice. He did seem to find ways to have problems.\n JK McKay, former USC administrator\nHe was a young guy, and he was controversial. They said in the papers that I was supposed to keep him off ESPN's \"SportsCenter.\"\n Kiffin\nI had a very large ego. Kids who are given too much, too early sometimes -- you see it in actors all the time. Sometimes you're not ready for all that. I wasn't ready at 31 to be the head coach of the Raiders, 32 at Tennessee, 33 or 34 at USC. I wasn't ready for all that fame and that money. Some of that is my fault. And I think there's also the factor of being really young, you leave Tennessee so you have part of the country that hates you and is pissed off at you. It's human nature that there's some jealousy from guys going, \"He's this age, and he's got this and he's got that and got a really attractive wife.\" I know there was a lot of that. People want you to fail. That's America.\nPeople might have been rooting for Kiffin to fail, but the cards were also stacked against him. When he took the job, the Trojans were enmeshed in an NCAA investigation surrounding improper benefits to former running back Reggie Bush. Ultimately, the school was given debilitating sanctions, including a two-year bowl ban, and lost 30 scholarships over a three-year span.\n Kiffin\nWhen Pat Haden was hired, he said to me, \"I need you to get us through probation. Do not cheat, do not have any violations.\" He said, \"I know you're going to lose games, and I know the Coliseum is going to be half-full. ... I'm prepared for it. But we need to get off probation.\"\n Wolf\nThey used to put out a weekly stat with how many players they had available because they were upset with the NCAA.\nKiffin\nEven though no one had ever done it before and been successful, there was a kind of arrogance of, \"Oh, we're USC and it'll be fine.\" But I had a major concern that the numbers were taking their toll.\n McKay\nMy expectations were unreasonably high. With the scholarship restrictions we were under, I just looked this up: A couple years ago a team backed out of a bowl game because they only had 58 players and they felt that was unsafe or unfair. We went years without having 50. I don't think I understood it at the time.\nDespite the sanctions, USC finished the 2011 season 10-2, adding ample hype for 2012. The Trojans opened that year as the preseason No. 1 team in the country. That's when the wheels came off. USC finished 2012 7-6, including an embarrassing performance in the Sun Bowl vs. Georgia Tech.\n Weber\n[The Trojans] go to the Sun Bowl. They didn't want to be there. Lane didn't want to be there. They had a fight in the locker room afterwards. All these parents that are on the plane with me back from El Paso saying, \"Did you hear what happened?\" because all their kids had told them these stories. That's the setup for the next year.\n Kevin Graf, USC offensive lineman, 2009-13\nThe way [2012] ended, I didn't know if this was a situation I wanted to really come back for. But SC is such a special place to me, and I wasn't ready to leave it that way. But that [frustration] carried on into spring ball. Spring was a weird situation. And it carried into the season as well.\nUSC opened the 2013 season 3-1 with an ugly 10-7 loss to Washington State at the Coliseum. Then came a road trip to Arizona State that proved to be one of the most embarrassing losses in recent USC history.\n Nwaisser\nI don't think going into 2013 people were expecting a huge turnaround. He was already on a short leash as fans were concerned.\n Max Browne, USC quarterback, 2013-16\nTo think he was not on the hot seat would've been naïve.\n Helton\nAs coaches, you're so ingrained in routine and just getting ready for the next game, it didn't come into my thought process. We were just trying to get ready each week. I never felt like, \"Oh gosh if this happens we may be out of a job.\"\n Nwaisser\nThere was a hope, I think, among fans that the end would be coming soon. The \"Fire Kiffin\" chants had already started.\nI have a feeling this won't be the only time a fire lane is used this way at the Coliseum this year pic.twitter.com/p5rZNC4Qnw\n Kiffin\nThere's not many professions that millions of people root for you every Saturday to get fired.\n Helton\nIt was one of those shootout games. We put 40-plus points up, but they put up 60-plus. At that time, if you didn't bring your \"A\" game, you'd get your butts beat. And we did not play our best game.\n Mike Norvell, Arizona State offensive coordinator, 2012-15\nI've still got a helmet. Coach [Todd] Graham gave me a helmet because it was the most points they'd ever scored against USC. It was a special night. Our players, that was a big game for our program.\n Tessalone\nBy the end of that season, they had 44 scholarship players available because of NCAA sanctions and injuries. They were working some magic, and Lane really had a plan on how to deal with the limitations that were very severe -- way more severe than they should've been. But at USC, they don't take excuses.\n Wolf\nThey decided to fire him -- not at the airport. They were in the locker room, Haden, JK McKay and Mark Jackson. They stayed in there after halftime, and they decided in that little locker room to fire him. And they didn't tell him until they got back to L.A.\n Weber\nI still remember talking to people in the press box. There's [USC president C.L.] Max Nikias right behind the bench, and he's talking to the head of the board of trustees. And you could see him call Pat Haden over, and I'm thinking, \"This might not be so good.\" And [the conversation] was happening right behind the bench. They weren't trying to hide it.\n Helton\nIt felt like normal after a loss, after you get your butt kicked. You're trying to get to the tape as fast as you can to get it fixed for the next week.\n Kiffin\nMaybe I was naïve, but I was shocked. The whole airport story.\n Tessalone\nI had no idea what was going down until I walked onto the plane. I was one of the last guys, and Pat pulled me aside and said, \"Hey, we need to talk. We're going to make a change.\" So now my mind starts spinning.\n Browne\nI remember sitting toward the front of the plane. Lane always sits in the very back. I remember him walking up to the front, and I remember thinking, \"Hey that's weird.\"\n Kiffin\nI sat in the back with the players. Pat Haden sat up front in first class. I got a message saying Pat wants to see you after [we land]. I'm certainly not thinking that I'm getting fired. I remember walking up there because I was going to ask him, \"Hey, can we just talk on the plane?\" I walked up and Pat was sleeping, and his wife, Cindy, looked at me and started crying.\nThe charter plane landed at LAX around 3 a.m. local time. What happened from there became part of college football lore -- the moment the most reviled head coach in the country got pulled off the team bus so he could be fired on an airport tarmac. Only, that's not exactly how it went down.\n Kiffin\nI don't see [Haden] when I get off [the plane], so I get on the bus. JK McKay stops the bus and grabs me and brings me in. I said to him I was going back to sleep in the office because it's 3 in the morning and I'm getting ready for work the next day.\n Rick Carr, USC head of athletics security\nFor road games, I would drive over to [Kiffin's] house on Fridays, pick him up, and drive his car over to the airport. Lane had told me before we got off the plane, \"Just take my car home because I'm going to spend the weekend at the office.\" I was walking from the plane past the buses, and Pat Haden stops me and says, \"Where's Lane?\" I said, \"He was going back to the office. He's staying there.\" And he says, \"Well, bring his car around.\"\n Wolf\nSteve Lopes was an administrator. He literally gets in front of a bus and stops the bus as it's leaving the parking lot.\n Tessalone\nObviously, lots of side stories came out about [Kiffin] getting yanked off the bus.\n Browne\nThat whole bus story, the one that got a bunch of pub, as a player, it was not a drama-filled bus ride.\nWolf\n[Kiffin] had this briefcase he used to take with him, and he left it on the bus because he thought he was going to talk to those guys for like 10 minutes and get back on the bus. He went to this little building, and they sent the bus to USC. He had to get someone to get his briefcase and bring it back to his house because he never went back to USC.\n Carr\nFor complete transparency, it was not the tarmac. It was an office in the terminal.\n Weber\nLane has developed a sense of humor, but he always used to talk to us about what the storyline was. I think Lane realized tarmac sounded better. He didn't get fired on the tarmac. There was like a small building where the charter jets would pull up to. But it always sounded better, and Lane was smart enough to realize, \"I'm going to go with tarmac.\"\n Tessalone\nIt's a charter company. They have a little building there on the south side of the airport. They go into the building and have a conversation that lasts quite a while. It was very surreal for me, just sitting there waiting for a while, sitting on a couch in this tiny little terminal.\n Kiffin\nI even said to him, \"OK, what's the use of changing now? Even if you want to fire me, let me just finish with these players and coach the rest of the year.\" Actually, I think I had him turned to not firing me because I'm reminding him we don't have 30 scholarship players. He walks out. And he's like, \"Yeah, I get it, maybe we jumped the gun on this.\" So he walks out and makes a call, and he comes back in and says, \"No, I can't take this back.\"\n Carr\nPat walks out, and Lane's still sitting there. Pat takes a lap around the patio area and walks back in. Comes back out and does another lap. At that point, I see our sports information guy and our CFO, and they're off in the corner of the parking lot, and I said to myself, \"Wait a minute, he's getting whacked.\" It was like when Joe Pesci walks into the room in \"Goodfellas.\"\n Kiffin\nYou get that dream job, and I say, you lose it and have it taken away. The reason I say it that way is, when you get fired, you lose your job, and you look at it and say, \"I should've done it this way or that way. I should've hired different.\" Whatever it was. It's all the things you look at vs. saying, \"I got screwed over.\" In this case, I could've done things much better, but I also got it taken away for things that weren't my fault because there were 30 scholarships lost and a two-year bowl ban. We lost recruits because they couldn't play on TV. We lost current players because the juniors and seniors could transfer. But that was all forgotten. We're playing with 30 less scholarships, losing at Arizona State but 3-2 [in 2013], 28-15 overall. Not 0-6 or whatever. Coaches with full rosters of 85 scholarship players, you don't usually get fired at 3-2.\n Garrett\n[Haden's] war was with me. Getting rid of Lane was a way to say I didn't know what I was doing, and I was lucky with Pete Carroll. Lane was really a byproduct of all that. If [Haden] got rid of Lane, it reflected on me.\nESPN contacted former USC athletic director Pat Haden, former interim coach Ed Orgeron, and former university president Max Nikias. All declined to comment for this story.\n Carr\nLane gets in the car and the first thing he says is, \"I'm sorry that took so long. I didn't mean to keep you.\"\n Tessalone\nLane lived in Manhattan Beach at the time. I lived in Redondo Beach, which was two beaches south of that. It was 3 in the morning, something like that. I told Lane, \"Hey, I'll follow you home.\" So there's Kiff, going down the deserted Pacific Coast Highway, and he turns off, and I kept going down to Redondo. And I got in after 3 in the morning thinking, OK, I have to write a press release that Lane Kiffin's been fired.\n Nwaisser\nI remember getting up, it was still dark, and I saw the news on my phone, and I basically had a little minicelebration in our hotel room in Arizona.\n Kiffin\nIt's 5 a.m. The sun's getting ready to come up. I'm sitting in the backyard, and I said to my wife, \"When I go to bed, I don't want to wake up.\" She's got a little more perspective, and she said, \"You have three children upstairs. Don't ever say that again.\"\nWhen news trickled out about Kiffin's departure -- and the details of how it happened -- the story transcended college football and became a pop culture moment.\n Nwaisser\nGetting fired on the tarmac, the memes kind of make themselves. It was funny and it was sad. It sucked to be a USC fan and have all this happen to us but I don't think a lot of people were sad to see Kiffin go.\n Weber\nI'm driving back from Tempe listening to ESPN Radio. The guy's on, and he sounded half-asleep. And he says, \"There's some rumblings about USC.\" I pull over, and I'm sitting there on I-10 with my laptop out trying to write the story. There wasn't anybody you could call in the middle of the night.\n Tessalone\nI'd never written a press release at 4 a.m. I remember opening up Twitter, and it's 7 a.m. on the East Coast, and you could just see the story traveling from the East Coast to the midwest to the West Coast as all these media people start waking up.\n Kiffin\nIf you get fired at the end of the year, you have this disaster, and you have to deal with it, and then you get a new job. You're in the media with 20 other coaches getting fired. When you get fired in Week 5 in L.A., you're the story.\n Wolf\nI was live tweeting this from my hotel room at like 4 in the morning. I'd talked to some people who were on the bus, so I broke that story about the tarmac. I got savaged by people who say I was making it up. Now everybody talks about it -- especially him.\n Pat Chun, FAU athletic director, 2012-2017\nThe brand value of USC and Lane Kiffin and social media and it's a perfect storm of awkward circumstances to separate a coach from his job.\nWolf\nAnd now every time someone doesn't like a coach, \"They need to tarmac him.\"\nIn the aftermath of Kiffin's dismissal, USC still had games to play, and the Trojans turned to Orgeron to lead the program the rest of the way -- or, at least long enough for them to hire someone else.\n Browne\nWe got a text first thing Sunday morning that there's a team meeting. At that point, you knew the writing was on the wall.\n Graf\nWe were all somewhat relieved because we weren't living up to what we needed to, and we felt like Lane -- I don't know if he was trying to pin players against each other, but we all felt like it was in our interests to continue on without him. Let's start clean, have Coach O come in and lead, and you saw quite a switch.\n Browne\nWhen Coach Orgeron came in, it was an injection of personality and energy into our locker room. He was getting us fast-food trucks on Wednesday and Thursday. We started going to movies the night before the game. Trying to lighten the air for a team that had a ton of pressure. It was much more fun.\n Helton\nThat whole season, to be honest, is one of my favorite seasons. You always get to see who you are when adversity hits ... that group of men, saying our job is to go do our job and not look for the next job.\n Tessalone\nEd was incredibly popular with our players and our fans. When he took over -- he's just this larger-than-life personality. He'd done a great job during his time at SC and got the team going. They had the big upset over Stanford at home. I think everybody kind of thought he'd get a shot.\n Pat Haden, former USC athletic director, in 2013\nI counted them actually. I had 136 pro-Coach O emails today. Those were just emails. That doesn't count the tweets, letters and phone calls. In my day, they sent 'em by carrier pigeon. Now, I get 'em four or five ways.\nUSC rebounded after Kiffin's termination and finished the regular season 9-4, but lost to both Notre Dame and UCLA. Orgeron felt he'd earned the job full time. USC felt differently. On Dec. 2, two days after the Trojans' final home game, Steve Sarkisian, who'd worked with Kiffin as an assistant under Carroll, was named the new head coach. Orgeron was not pleased, and USC still had a bowl game to play.\n Wolf\nYou had the tarmac incident and two months later Ed Orgeron is storming off campus in his SUV because he didn't get the job. And nobody sees him again because he was so mad.\nWith Sarkisian in the press box, and none of the remaining coaches certain they'd have a job the next day, Helton's staff led a surprising upset of Fresno State 45-20 for USC's 10th win in a season in which the team had four different head coaches.\n Graf\nNo one knew what we were going through, and so it bonded the team closer. We were in a bad spot, and to turn it around and make it as fun as he did and to win 10 games under four different coaches -- other teams would fold, but it almost brought us together as kind of a brotherhood.\n Helton\nIt kind of put an exclamation point on a year that when a group of men rally together and support each other, great things can happen.\n Graf\nAs wild a year as that was, the closeness the team was able to have, the way we finished it off, I'm glad I left SC with a win.\n Rece Davis, play-by-play voice for the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl\nTee [Martin] and the offensive coaches were in the booth next to us. As soon as the game was over, he held up a sign that said, \"Will coach for food.\" It was the proverbial gallows humor.\nSarkisian, too, was ultimately fired midway through the 2015 season. Helton again stepped in as interim and, perhaps aware of the mistake in letting Orgeron walk in 2013, USC ultimately kept Helton on full time. His tenure was marked by more disgruntled fans, a 46-24 overall record, and just one top-10 finish. Helton was fired two games into the 2021 season.\n Weber\nFrom August to December [2013], they had four coaches. They're the only program who's fired two coaches in the middle of the season two years apart.\n Kiffin\nYou get far enough removed where then you don't care. Right after I left, it's human nature [to root against USC]. It's the ego involved. We think everyone's comparing, which they aren't.\n Garrett\nHaden didn't know what the hell he was doing. So the place got worse, morale got bad. There's no question in my mind if he gave Lane the time and the support and didn't think of him as a Mike Garrett selection, Lane would've been successful.\nKiffin\nI didn't do well. [My wife] said, \"Utilize this time with your kids and family.\" I just sat around and felt sorry for myself and watched football games all the time.\nI needed a job. I didn't have balance. My job defined me. My job was my higher power. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to exist without my job.\nKiffin found salvation in the most unlikely of places -- at Alabama, with staid, stoic, understated coach Nick Saban. The results on the field were incredible, with Kiffin reimagining the old-school Alabama offense as an up-tempo attack that brought the Tide in line with the modern game. Off the field, however, the Saban-Kiffin dynamic was ... complicated.\n Kiffin\n[Saban] and [agent] Jimmy Sexton called me when I was [an assistant] at USC, we'd won the [2005] Orange Bowl. Offers me the offensive coordinator job [with the Miami Dolphins]. He'd watched us in the Orange Bowl. We'd just smoked Oklahoma. I didn't go. Then he gets the Alabama job [in 2007]. After I was fired, he said, \"Hey come out here and watch practice.\" I did. I spent 10 days out there, got to know him a little bit, and the offensive coordinator job opened up a month later and he called me.\n Weber\nWhen Lane left L.A., he sold his house to Vince Vaughn, the actor. You've got to have a pretty good house if you're able to sell it to Vince Vaughn.\n Kiffin\nThat is accurate, yes. [Vaughn] was on \"College GameDay.\" He picked Alabama and not us. I thought maybe he'd say, \"Well, I bought Lane Kiffin's house, so I better pick them.\"\n Locksley\nLane and Coach [Saban] are probably more similar than they are different in terms of football. Lane's a social media darling. That side is different. Coach is more reserved, more conservative. But if you spend enough time with Lane, they're both high, high, high intelligence levels, great problem-solvers, tremendous ability to communicate. Now, the social media, the outside-the-box stuff that Lane does, that's obviously different.\n Kiffin\nTwo polar opposite people. The one common theme is ultracompetitive, but outside of that, very different people. Especially back then.\nIt had its ups and downs. If I were to redo it perfectly, I say you should get a two-day seminar from someone -- like a previous offensive coordinator -- I would have done it better if I'd had a 48-hour seminar with McElwain or something to explain how it works.\nWhen you say, \"Hey, Coach, what do you think about this?\" and I think that's just normal conversation. He's interpreting it as I'm questioning the process. Because you sit in the staff meetings and nobody talks. I remember looking at Kirby [Smart] or Billy Napier and thinking, \"Does anybody say anything but 'Yes, sir?'\" Coach could walk in and say, \"This week we're going to play with 10 players,\" and everyone would say, \"Yes, sir, great idea.\"\nBut I take all the blame for that there was friction at first. The production worked. But communication and relationship didn't. I take blame for that because it's not his job to change. It's my job to change.\nFor Kiffin, the on-field success did help him find closure on his exit at USC. At the conclusion of the 2015 season, Alabama won a national title with Kiffin calling the plays. It came almost 10 years to the day after the Trojans' historic loss to Texas in the national championship game, when Kiffin had notoriously left Reggie Bush on the sideline in the game's critical, final moments.\nThen came Alabama's 2016 season opener against a familiar adversary: USC.\n Locksley\nThat was actually my first game I was at Bama for [as an offensive analyst]. Going into the game, knowing the situation of Lane and USC and being fired on the tarmac, infamously he'd put something at the top of the call sheet that we all had -- either the date or the time that he was fired.\n Kiffin\nIt was the time.\n Locksley\nI remember in the middle of the game, we were winning pretty handily, and anybody who's worked for Coach [Saban] knows he's a class act when it comes to that stuff. He made the decision -- when he tells you to take the air out of the ball, as he likes to say, that means slow things down. We don't need to try to score. Keep the clock moving.\nWell, Lane missed that conversation on the headset, and threw a Sluggo touchdown to Gehrig Dieter, and I can remember Coach on the headset saying, \"Hey man, does it make you feel any better that you're doing this? Does it get you your job back?\"\nAnd I can remember Lane saying, 'No, it doesn't, but it sure feels good.'\nAnd Coach went off on him after that.\nAfter the game, Kiffin posted a photo of his son with the game ball and the hashtag: \"3:14AM-LAX.\"\nPost game w the game ball!!! #3:14AM-LAX pic.twitter.com/cxQkJ89254\n Tessalone\nWe were talking one time and he goes, \"You know my nickname when I was a kid, right?\" I said no. He goes, \"It was 'Helicopter.' Because when I was a kid, I would walk into a room and just stir everything up.\"\n Davis\nSomeday, when they write an epitaph for Lane Kiffin, it's going to be, \"He couldn't help himself.\"\nKiffin's relationship with Saban ultimately blew up after the College Football Playoff semifinal in Atlanta. Kiffin had already accepted the head-coaching job at FAU, and Saban was supposedly concerned that his offensive coordinator already had one foot out the door. Kiffin and Alabama parted ways just a week before the national championship game. He was replaced, again, with Steve Sarkisian.\n Nick Saban, Alabama head coach, in 2017\nThis wasn't an easy decision, and we appreciate the way Lane handled this in terms of doing what is best for our team. At the end of the day, both of us wanted to put our players in the best position to be successful.\n Kiffin\nI think a lot of times, I was a jerk. Maybe stubborn is the better word. Just to remember, this is his program. If he says to wear pink underwear, you wear pink underwear. I was so used to the open communication thing, I really struggled with that transition.\n Locksley\nWhen I think of Lane, I think of the California cool kid. Being at Alabama really emphasized the importance of structure and having processes and building a program. You can see the role that Coach played -- not just in Lane but in a lot of us that came through that program that Coach Saban has built.\n Kiffin\nProbably not a day goes by where there's not something that I say [that's] something he says or think of something [Saban] says. He's kind of like a parent. I was raised by my dad and had, like, two stepdads in Pete Carroll and Nick Saban. You can still hear those voices. That happens to me a lot. Coach doesn't pick up the phone and go, \"Hey, man. What are you doing? Just driving home and going fishing.\" That doesn't happen. But a lot of times, out of nowhere, I'll just [text], \"Thanks again.\"\nIt was at FAU where Kiffin finally found a fresh start. For the first time in his career, he was at a place that didn't have national title aspirations. He was building, rather than inheriting, a program.\n Chun\nHe was so well-prepared in his interview. He addressed all the Twitter rumors about himself, very upfront. But it was a very thoughtful, engaging presentation on him as a head football coach, the lessons he learned on his very unique journey and where that put him at in that moment and why he was prepared to be a head coach again.\n Kiffin\nAfter we won to go to a bowl game, they bowled in the locker room. I'd never been anywhere that celebrated six wins. And it was so cool because it was on a smaller stage where people were enjoying it -- not for what it gives you, but for the enjoyment of the game. And you were giving players something they hadn't had before. You're supposed to start that way -- Urban [Meyer] at Bowling Green, Saban at Toledo. You're supposed to start down and work up. You're not supposed to get your first job at 31 in the NFL and then Tennessee and USC.\n Jon Gordon, author and motivational speaker\nI'd never liked him. Never liked his public persona, and I didn't expect to like him. But I went to visit him and I actually liked him a lot. He was beginning the process of wanting to make a change.\n Kiffin\nI saw a podcast the other day on the rapper Macklemore, and he's talking about, he's winning the Grammy. He's on stage. He's got everything. And he's not fulfilled. And later, he's in rehab. He's making coffee in the morning for people. He's serving others. And he says, \"I felt more fulfilled doing that than when I was on stage.\" I feel like I can relate to that. I can tell people, there are trophies and wins and new contracts and things. I'm not saying they're not great, but that's not true fulfillment.\nI wouldn't have said that 10 years ago.\nThree years after being hired at FAU, Kiffin landed another Power 5 job -- back in the SEC at Ole Miss. He's still a lightning rod for public scrutiny, but he has shown he has a sense of humor about most of it, publicly tweaking Saban routinely, interacting with fans and critics alike on social media, and finding something approaching a sense of peace with his place in the college football universe.\nWeber\nHe had a lot of learning experiences.\n Browne\nI remember the criticism around him, some people would champion the point that he was not great with the media, and he wasn't personable, and you fast forward a decade and he's maybe the most personable, real coach out there.\nHe's set a standard for what it means to be a coach in the social media era.\n Helton\nTo take a step back and it really jumps you three steps forward. I'm just so happy for him to see the maturity and really the peace that he has. He's still innovative.\n Graf\nLooking at Lane now, he has a lot of fun. He talks s---. He has fun with his players. If he was more like that during his SC days, things may have panned out different.\n McKay\nI'm sorry for what happened to Lane at SC, but I think things happen for a reason, and he's moved on and is a hell of a football coach.\n Kiffin\nI think people go their whole life without being glad that bad things happen. They hold anger and resentment -- toward the people, the AD, the fans. They don't ever let that go. And it only hurts them. It didn't hurt USC if I was mad at them. So, I let that go. And I'm glad I've had this experience."}

The Jaguars have scored just two touchdowns in their past eight quarters and rank 29th in third-down conversion rate (29.7%). The Falcons have scored only two first-half touchdowns in three games and managed just six points last week. One of these teams getting into the end zone early could determine the outcome. -- Mike DiRocco\nBold prediction: The last time Kyle Pitts played in London -- in 2021 against the Jets -- the tight end scored his first career touchdown (and only TD that season). Back in the U.K., Pitts will find the end zone twice. Jacksonville has given up two scores to tight ends over the past two weeks, so the opportunity could be there for Pitts to score for the first time since Oct. 30, 2022. -- Michael Rothstein\nStat to know: Since Week 9 of last season, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence has led the league in QBR throwing outside the numbers, recording an impressive 15 touchdown passes to just one interception.

Lloyd (thumb) out next two games in London ... What's wrong with the Jaguars?\n\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: BUF -2.5 (53.5)\nStoryline to watch: Whether the Bills can slow down the Dolphins' offense is the big question going into the game, and while Buffalo's ability to get pressure and turnovers will be key, its offense playing keep-away would help. Buffalo's offense is third in average time of possession (35:45). And while winning convincingly hasn't been a problem for either team, with the Dolphins outscoring their opponents by 59 points and the Bills outscoring theirs by 56, all three games between Buffalo and Miami last year were decided by three points or fewer. So another close game could happen. -- Alaina Getzenberg\nBold prediction: The Bills have not allowed 500 yards of offense in a regular-season game since Sept. 20, 2015, but that streak will end Sunday as the Dolphins -- who are averaging 550.3 yards per game -- continue to surge. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nStat to know: Bills QB Josh Allen is 9-2 in his career against the Dolphins (including playoffs), his most wins against any team. He is a perfect 6-0 at home vs. Miami.\nMatchup X factor: Dolphins edge rushers Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb. They have just 1.5 sacks combined this season, but both rank in the top 15 in pass rush win rate at edge. Both offenses should be explosive, so the Dolphins' pass rush could give Miami an edge if it can get to Allen. -- Walder\nInjuries: Dolphins | Bills\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Bills have the third-highest pass rush win rate and had nine sacks against the Commanders in Week 3. They'll face a challenge his week, though. The Dolphins' offensive line ranks 12th in pass block win rate, and Miami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has the fastest average time to throw in the league (2.2 seconds). See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Dolphins lead the NFL with a +18.0 cover margin, the second-best mark in the NFL through three games in the past seven seasons (2022 Jaguars were +19.5). They are 3-0 ATS.

Both teams suffered blowout losses in Week 3, too. The Broncos allowed Miami to score 70 points and gain 726 yards, while the Bears are looking to rebound from a 31-point road loss to Kansas City and snap the NFL's longest active losing streak at 13 games. It has been nearly a year since the Bears won a game (Oct. 24, 2022, at New England). -- Courtney Cronin\nBold prediction: A reeling Broncos defense -- last in almost every major statistical category -- will sack Bears QB Justin Fields at least twice and snag an interception. After surrendering 70 points to Miami, the Broncos face the league's 27th-ranked scoring offense, as the Bears are averaging a not-so-robust 15.7 points. -- Jeff Legwold\nStat to know: The Bears have allowed 106 points through three games, the second-most in franchise history (111 in 2003). Chicago's most points allowed through four games is 134 (1964).\nLiz Loza deems Javonte Williams a low-end RB2 in Week 4 vs. the Bears.\nMatchup X factor: Fields. Forgive the obvious answer, but he's the clear X factor for the Bears. Chicago has other problems, no doubt. But a league-worst 21 QBR from Fields has to improve. -- Walder\nInjuries: Broncos | Bears\nWhat to know for fantasy: Russell Wilson ranks eighth in passing yards and sixth in touchdown passes, and he averages 18.4 fantasy points. His touchdown-to-interception ratio in his first three games has been 6-1, and he has thrown for 300-plus yards in consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 3 and 4 of the 2020 season. It bodes well for Broncos wide receivers Courtland Sutton, Jerry Jeudy and Marvin Mims Jr. against the Bears, as quarterbacks have scored the fifth-most points against them. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Broncos are 1-8 ATS as favorites since the start of last season and 1-9 ATS in their past 10 games in that role.

Bears' Eberflus plans to call defensive plays rest of season\n\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: CLE -3 (40.5)\nStoryline to watch: QB Deshaun Watson has not won (or lost) consecutive games since joining the Browns. He can finally put together a winning streak if he can outduel Lamar Jackson, who is 2-0 against Watson in head-to-head matchups dating to Watson's time with the Texans. While Watson hasn't defeated Jackson, he did guide the Browns past a Tyler Huntley-led Ravens team in December. -- Jake Trotter\nBold prediction: Jackson will be held without a touchdown. He has totaled more touchdowns against the Browns than any other team in his six-year career, throwing for 11 and running for four. But the Browns' defense has given up only one touchdown this season and hasn't allowed one in Cleveland. -- Jamison Hensley\nStat to know: The Browns have not allowed a TD in two home games this season (outscored opponents 51-6 in Cleveland). The 2006 Broncos and 2000 Dolphins are the only teams this century to not allow a touchdown in their first three home games.\nMatchup X factor: Browns cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. His 0.4 yards per coverage snap is best among all outside corners with at least 75 coverage snaps. -- Walder\nInjuries: Ravens | Browns\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Browns' defense has allowed the fewest fantasy points per game to quarterbacks and a completion rate of less than 50%. Cleveland's defense also ranks first in run stop rate. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Ravens are 18-3-1 ATS as underdogs since 2018, the best record in the NFL (12-10 outright). Jackson is 11-1-1 ATS as an underdog (9-4 outright), the best cover percentage and winning percentage as an underdog by any quarterback with at least 10 starts in that role.

The Bengals' young safeties Dax Hill and Nick Scott will be eager to come up and help against the run, especially for a defense that has taken pride in slowing down RB Derrick Henry. QB Ryan Tannehill's two longest completions this season came via play-action (a 70-yard pass to WR Treylon Burks and a 49-yard bomb to WR Chris Moore). Both throws traveled 20-plus yards in the air. Meanwhile, the Bengals have allowed an NFL-high 10.0 air yards per completion. -- Turron Davenport\nBold prediction: Defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons and the rest of the Titans' defensive line will have no sacks. Cincinnati's much-maligned pass blocking has made big improvements over the past two weeks. That and QB Joe Burrow's especially quick release because of his right calf injury will lead to a lack of production for one of the NFL's best interior defensive lines. -- Ben Baby\nStat to know: The Bengals have allowed only five sacks this season, their fewest through three games since 2018. Cincinnati is seeking its 12th straight game allowing fewer than three sacks (would be its longest streak since 18 straight from 2005 to '06 and second-longest in franchise history).\nJoe Burrow will be looking to get the ball to Ja'marr Chase often. Here's a way Cincinnati has gotten Chase some quick and easy catches. Titans DBs have to tackle to prevent YAC. Video by Turron Davenport.\nMatchup X factor: Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. He has been notably absent, with just 110 receiving yards through three games, and his 46 Open Score via our Receiver Tracking Metrics is an eyebrow-raiser. The Bengals need more from him. -- Walder\nInjuries: Bengals | Titans\nWhat to know for fantasy: It is difficult to run on the Titans' defense, but you can throw on them. This year, Tennessee's secondary has allowed 275.3 passing yards per game, fifth-most in the league. Quarterbacks have averaged 19.7 fantasy points against the Titans. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Titans are 25-15-1 ATS as underdogs under coach Mike Vrabel, including 21-20 outright. They are 10-5 outright and ATS as home underdogs under him.

The Colts' defense is second in the NFL with 12 sacks. Los Angeles is 27th in pass block win rate, which has negatively impacted Rams QB Matthew Stafford (60.8% completion rate and 2-to-4 TD-to-interception ratio). -- Stephen Holder\nBold prediction: Colts QB Anthony Richardson will become the first quarterback since 1950 with a rushing touchdown in each of his first three NFL games. The Rams have allowed four rushing touchdowns in their first three games of the season, including one to 49ers QB Brock Purdy. -- Sarah Barshop\nStat to know: The Colts have lost six straight home games. A seventh defeat would mean their longest home losing streak since they dropped eight straight in 1991 (the franchise record is nine).\nMatchup X factor: Colts defensive tackle DeForest Buckner. The interior of the Rams' offensive line is vulnerable, and that should open the door for Buckner to disrupt or sack Stafford. -- Walder\nInjuries: Rams | Colts\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Colts' defense has given up the seventh-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers, so insert Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell into your fantasy lineups. Indy's defense is allowing 250.7 passing yards per game, 10th-most in the league. Plus, the Rams might rely heavily on the passing game because the Colts rank fourth in run stop win rate. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Rams road games are 7-1-1 to the under since the start of last season. Read more.\nMoody's pick: Colts 24, Rams 17\nWalder's pick: Rams 26, Colts 17\nFPI prediction: LAR, 55.9% (by an average of 2.1 points)\n\nMatchup must-reads: Rams hope to have Kupp back in Week 5 ... Moss finally feeling 'appreciated' amid career highs\n\n1 p.m. ET | FOX | Spread: NO -3 (39.5)\nStoryline to watch: The Saints will get RB Alvin Kamara back from suspension this week, which couldn't be more timely for a team that averages 93.3 rushing yards per game and faces a Buccaneers team susceptible to the run. Whether they have QB Derek Carr is a question, as Carr is currently recovering from a right shoulder injury sustained against the Packers on Sunday. If Carr can't go, then Jameis Winston will be getting the start against his former team. -- Katherine Terrell\nBold prediction: Bucs linebackers Lavonte David and Shaquil Barrett will combine for 3.0 sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. David has 3.0 sacks and a forced fumble in the past three meetings against the Saints, and if right guard Cesar Ruiz remains out with a concussion, it could create some opportunities for Todd Bowles' interior blitzes. Barrett also had 2.0 sacks and a forced fumble the last time he saw the Saints in Week 2 last season, and they happened working against Saints tackles James Hurst and Ryan Ramczyk. -- Jenna Laine\nStat to know: Baker Mayfield's one interception is the fewest he has thrown in the first three games of a season in his career, while his three sacks taken are tied for the fewest in the first three games. Mayfield has never gone the first four games of a season without throwing multiple interceptions.\n\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\nMatchup X factor: Bucs edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. His 14% pass rush win rate this year is below average, but he gets to face Saints tackle Trevor Penning on Sunday. Penning's pass block win rate is 74.3%, which ranks 58th out of 62 tackles. That presents an opportunity for Tryon-Shoyinka and could result in him getting to Winston or Carr. -- Walder\nInjuries: Buccaneers | Saints\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Buccaneers' defense ranks last in the league in run stop win rate and this unit just gave up 130 rushing yards to Eagles running back D'Andre Swift in Week 3. That presents an opportunity for Kamara, especially since Jamaal Williams is on injured reserve. In 26 career games where Kamara has had 15-plus rushing attempts, he has averaged 19.8 fantasy points. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Dennis Allen is 21-34-1 ATS in his career (.382). Out of coaches with at least 50 games in the Super Bowl era, Allen has the worst cover percentage and is the only one below 40%. Bowles is 37-44-5 ATS (.457).

He has been sacked a league-high 19 times and has been pressured the fifth-most of any QB in the NFL (36.6%). Now he faces a disruptive interior defensive front featuring Fletcher Cox, Jordan Davis and rookie Jalen Carter, who ranks second among defensive tackles with 15 pressures. Howell's five interceptions are the second-most entering Week 4, while the Eagles' defense is tied for second in takeaways with eight. -- Tim McManus\nBold prediction: Washington will sell out to stop the Eagles' rushing attack -- D'Andre Swift in particular. He has rushed for a combined 305 yards the past two weeks, but the Commanders will hold him to fewer than 100 yards. Washington has been boom or bust against the Eagles' rushing attack in the past four meetings. The Commanders have held them to less than 118 rushing yards three times -- but gave up 238 in the fourth meeting. The Commanders will use a lot of their five-man defensive fronts against arguably the best offensive line in football; the key will be how Philadelphia throws the ball. -- John Keim\nStat to know: Jalen Hurts' 29 rushing touchdowns are the most by a quarterback in his first 50 games in NFL history (Sunday will be Hurts' 49th career game). He is looking to become the seventh player in Eagles history to record 30 rushing touchdowns and would join Randall Cunningham (32) as the only QBs to reach that mark.\nRobert Griffin III, Domonique Foxworth and Dan Graziano break down the biggest takeaways from the Eagles' start to the season.\nMatchup X factor: Commanders defensive tackles Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne. Slowing down the Eagles' run and forcing them to the air -- where they've been a little shaky -- seems crucial if Washington has any hopes of pulling an upset. -- Walder\nInjuries: Commanders | Eagles\nWhat to know for fantasy: Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith has played four games against the Commanders in his career, averaging 7.7 targets, 75.5 receiving yards and 15 fantasy points per game against Washington. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Commanders are 3-6-2 ATS as at least seven-point underdogs under coach Ron Rivera. All three covers were outright wins.

Each has reason to believe they can get a win. The Panthers welcome rookie QB Bryce Young (ankle) back to the starting lineup against a Vikings defense ranked 27th in the NFL, giving up 382.3 yards per game. The Vikings, with an offense ranked third overall and second in passing (339.7 yards per game), face a Panthers defense down two starters in the secondary (CB Jaycee Horn, S Xavier Woods) and banged up at several other positions. There are a lot of strengths versus weaknesses in this one. -- David Newton\nBold prediction: Running back Alexander Mattison will have the Vikings' first 100-yard rushing game of the season. The Vikings acquired Cam Akers from the Rams last week, and Akers will get some playing time Sunday, but Mattison will play with an extra competitive edge. It helps that the Panthers' defense is allowing 136.7 rushing yards per game, tied for fifth-worst in the NFL. -- Kevin Seifert\nStat to know: Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins leads the NFL with 1,075 passing yards (most through three games in Vikings history). He needs 313 yards to set a franchise record for most passing yards through the first four games of a season (he set the record in 2018).\nField Yates says Kirk Cousins remains underrated in fantasy football and insist managers start him in Week 4.\nMatchup X factor: Young. The reality is the offense was better with Andy Dalton in Week 3 than it was with the rookie QB in the first two weeks. So much hinges on whether and how quickly the No. 1 overall pick can improve. -- Walder\nInjuries: Vikings | Panthers\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Vikings' defense has allowed the third most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Adam Thielen has a favorable matchup against Vikings slot cornerback Josh Metellus, so the Panthers wide receiver should do well against his former team. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Panthers have won three straight games as home underdogs (3-1 ATS/straight up last season).

Stroud has yet to throw an interception in his NFL career. A potential issue for the Texans is they have injuries all over the offensive line as LT Laremy Tunsil, RT Tytus Howard, C Juice Scruggs, LG Kenyon Green and backup LT Josh Jones are injured. Tunsil and Jones aren't on injured reserve like Howard, Green and Scruggs, but they might not play on Sunday. -- DJ Bien-Aime\nBold prediction: Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt will tie his single-game career-high with four sacks. Because Stroud excelled at getting the ball out quickly against the Jaguars' blitz, the Texans didn't surrender a sack a week ago -- but gave up 11 in the previous two weeks. Watt had multiple sacks in two of three games this season, plus older brother J.J. Watt will be inducted into the Texans' Ring of Honor this weekend. Count on a friendly yet fierce sibling rivalry to get a little extra juice. -- Brooke Pryor\nStat to know: Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin's 23-4 record against rookie quarterbacks is the best record of any coach vs. first-year QBs since at least 1950 with a minimum of 15 games coached.\nMatchup X factor: Texans wide receiver Tank Dell. The rookie third-round pick ranks second in yards per route run against man coverage among wide receivers with at least 50 routes and looks like an emerging star. -- Walder\nInjuries: Steelers | Texans\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Texans' defense ranks 19th in run stop win rate and has allowed the fourth most fantasy points per game to running backs. Colts running back Zack Moss scored 20.7 fantasy points against Houston's defense in Week 2, and the Jaguars' Travis Etienne Jr. scored 17.8 fantasy points in Week 3. That bodes well for Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Texans are 0-9-1 outright in their past 10 home games (4-6 ATS). They are 2-6 ATS in their past eight home games.

Allen threw a passing touchdown and had 18 catches for 215 yards and a receiving score last week against the Vikings; Adams had 13 receptions for 172 yards and two touchdowns against Pittsburgh. Now, they both face struggling pass defenses. The Chargers' secondary has allowed the most passing yards this season (1,079), and both teams are tied for the third-most passing touchdowns allowed (seven). -- Kris Rhim\nBold prediction: No matter who is playing quarterback for the Raiders -- Jimmy Garoppolo, Brian Hoyer or Aidan O'Connell -- he will be sacked at least twice each by Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa. The Raiders' O-line allowed Garoppolo -- who is in concussion protocol -- to get sacked four times last week. Mack, the 2016 NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the Raiders, is looking for his first sack of the season, while Bosa already has three. -- Paul Gutierrez\nStat to know: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert has 213 consecutive passes without throwing an interception, the longest streak in team history.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Lowe: Breaking down the Lillard trade »\n• QB Hot Board for 2024 NFL draft »\n• What's real in international soccer »\n More ESPN+ content »\nMatchup X factor: Chargers cornerback Michael Davis.

That's part of the reason the Chargers' pass defense has been so poor. -- Walder\nInjuries: Raiders | Chargers\nWhat to know for fantasy: With just two rushing attempts of more than 10 yards and six passes of more than 20 yards, the Raiders have generated the fewest explosive plays in the league.

While Elliott's homecoming has been a central theme this week, the Cowboys need to find the form they had in the first two weeks defensively after a no-show against the Cardinals. Stopping Elliott and Rhamondre Stevenson will be at the top of the list, but offensively, they will have to find a way to score touchdowns in the red zone vs. a stingy Patriots defense. The Cowboys have converted six touchdowns in 15 red-zone trips. New England did not allow a red-zone trip to the Jets last week. -- Todd Archer\nBold prediction: Elliott will score his first rushing touchdown as a Patriot against his former team. Elliott is coming off his best game in New England (80 yards on 16 carries), and the Cowboys have shown a vulnerability against the run, ranking 30th in yards per carry allowed (5.3) and 25th in rushing yards allowed per game (131.3). -- Mike Reiss\nStat to know: Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott is averaging a career-low 6.3 yards per attempt and 5.3 air yards per attempt. The air yards is second-shortest in the league, behind only Colts rookie Anthony Richardson.\nDan Orlovsky doesn't understand why CeeDee Lamb's red zone targets are so low for the Cowboys.\nMatchup X factor: The Patriots offensive line. It already ranks last in pass block win rate and now is facing Micah Parsons and the Dallas pass rush. Good luck. -- Walder\nInjuries: Patriots | Cowboys\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Patriots' offensive line helped New England amass 157 rushing yards in Week 3. This Patriots grouping should remain together for a second consecutive week, which is noteworthy since this group did not get many reps together during the summer. That could be big for the Pats' running backs against a spotty Dallas rush defense. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Patriots quarterback Mac Jones is 0-10 ATS in his past 10 starts as an underdog. He is 3-11 ATS as an underdog in his career (2-12 outright). And the Patriots are 0-7 ATS in their past seven games as an underdog.

Elliott looking forward to facing Cowboys\n\n4:25 p.m. ET | FOX | Spread: SF -14 (44)\nStoryline to watch: The Cardinals' win against the Cowboys in Week 3 should serve as a warning to the Niners that Arizona is not to be taken lightly, especially with San Francisco scheduled for a Sunday night showdown against Dallas in Week 5. The Niners pride themselves on being the most physical team in every game, but a run defense that hasn't been tested much this year (opponents have attempted just 43 rushes, the fewest in the NFL through three weeks) will be challenged. Arizona enters this matchup ranked sixth in rushing yards and second in yards per rush. -- Nick Wagoner\nBold prediction: Cardinals QB Joshua Dobbs will finally break out and have his first 300-yard passing game while adding 75 yards on the ground. Dobbs has been solid so far, as his 61.2 QBR ranks 10th in the NFL, but he'll step it up even more and put Arizona in position to pull an upset. -- Josh Weinfuss\nStat to know: Niners running back Christian McCaffrey has 12 straight games, including playoffs, with a touchdown, matching Jerry Rice (1987) for the longest streak in franchise history.\nMatchup X factor: Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson. He's averaging a gaudy 17.1 air yards per target. If the Cardinals are going to somehow pull off this upset, they're probably going to need some deep shots to the rookie. -- Walder\nInjuries: Cardinals | 49ers\nWhat to know for fantasy: Only the Ravens, Browns, 49ers, Eagles and Dolphins have averaged more rushing yards per game than the Cardinals (156.3). Almost half the Cardinals' rushing attempts have gained five or more yards, second-highest in the league. See Week 4 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Cardinals are 3-0 ATS this season, all as an underdog. They are the first team to start 3-0 ATS and be double-digit underdogs in their fourth game since the 1977 Buccaneers and the first to be at least 14-point underdogs in their fourth game since the 1969 Falcons.

Since entering the league in 2021, Zach Wilson has a league-low 34.4 QBR, which is last among qualified passers. In the same span, Patrick Mahomes leads the NFL with a 73.4 QBR. This season has seen much of the same, as Mahomes' 69.2 QBR is fifth in the league, while Wilson's mark of 26.7 is 33rd out of 34 qualified quarterbacks. -- Rich Cimini\nBold prediction: The Chiefs will notch their first shutout since they blanked the Texans in a 2015 wild-card playoff win. The Chiefs are playing as well, if not better, on defense than they have since Andy Reid became their coach in 2013, while the Jets are struggling to make their way with Wilson at quarterback. The Chiefs took a shutout into the fourth quarter last week against the Bears. This time, they finish the job. -- Adam Teicher\nStat to know: With one passing touchdown on Sunday Night Football, Mahomes will surpass Hall of Famer Dan Marino for the fewest career games to 200 passing touchdowns in NFL history.\n• Early mock drafts: Miller » | Reid »\n• Ranks: Kiper » | Positional top fives »\n• QB Hot Board » | Early predictions »\n• Read more on the NFL draft class »\nMatchup X factor: Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner.

{"title": "How Duke's unlikely rise is fueled by an even unlikelier mantra", "date": "", "text": "Relive Duke's undefeated start to the season before the Blue Devils take on Notre Dame. (1:33)\nDURHAM, N.C. -- Somewhere, deep, deep down, Riley Leonard has to know he is a pretty decent quarterback. His 13-4 record as a college starter says as much. ESPN NFL draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. says as much, listing Leonard at No. 19 on his latest Big Board for 2024.\nBut here's the thing. Leonard doesn't want to hear all the praise. Back in high school in Fairhope, Alabama, he sat down with his parents and told them he wanted help to keep his edge and stay motivated.\n\"I need somebody to tell me I suck sometimes,\" he told them.\nHeather Leonard looked at her son.\n\"Hey,\" she said. \"I got you.\"\nThus a tradition began, one that continues now that Leonard and No. 17 Duke are 4-0 and receiving the type of national attention usually reserved for their championship-winning basketball program. With No. 11 Notre Dame (4-1) coming to town Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC), ESPN's \"College GameDay\" will be set in Durham for the first time for football.\nHeather Leonard will do what she always does before kickoff. She will tell Riley: \"You suck.\" If he needs another reminder, all Riley has to do is look at the blue wristband he wears with the phrase emblazoned on it. A gift from his mom, naturally.\nAn intrepid fan made similar wristbands and handed them out to anyone who would take one before a recent home game. Offensive tackle Graham Barton still has his tucked away in his jacket pocket.\n\"I think it fits us perfectly,\" Leonard said. \"All of us in this entire program carry a huge chip on our shoulder. We want to prove people wrong. I think it's a great message for our team.\"\nNow that Duke is winning, being reminded \"You suck\" serves the same motivational purpose for the team as it does for Leonard.\nAs an exercise back in the spring, second-year coach Mike Elko asked his players. \"How many of you were five-star recruits?\"\nEmpty stares.\n\"How about four stars?\" he asked.\nA few hands went up. Leonard was not among them.\nElko then pointed out their opponent in the season opener, Clemson, had a roster full of them. But why should that matter?\nSix months later, 4.4 million viewers tuned in to watch Duke beat Clemson 28-7, Leonard had his \"You Suck\" wristband featured on national television and then went viral after asking his professor for a homework extension.\nThe result may have stunned casual observers wondering how a team like Duke beat six-time College Football Playoff participant Clemson. Those inside the program? Not so much. They have watched the transformation from hopeless to hopeful over the past 21 months.\nThey also know their story starts well before Labor Day night.\nELKO WALKED INTO his first team meeting as Duke head coach in December 2021. He knew what an ACC team should look like, having spent time as defensive coordinator at Wake Forest earlier in his career. At least physically, this did not look like a team that could compete.\nThe record bears that out. Duke had a dazzling run of success -- relatively speaking -- under former coach David Cutcliffe, including its only appearance in the ACC championship game in 2013 and six bowl game appearances. But the program started to slip in 2019, going 5-7. Then the pandemic hit in 2020, and players say tight restrictions that limited normal weight room activities took a toll.\nBased on conversations he has had with the players, Duke director of football sport performance David Feeley estimates they had about 80 total workouts over a two-year period between 2020 and 2021.\nDuke won five total games those two seasons, and parted ways with Cutcliffe in November 2021.\n\"I call it a fever dream,\" veteran defensive tackle DeWayne Carter said. \"In essence, it didn't seem real.\"\nAs the losses started to mount, confidence waned. Duke went 0-8 in ACC play in 2021.\n\"You're getting up every single day, you know you're not doing very well, and you get in a negative headspace,\" Carter said. \"Like, why are we even preparing? You think you're going to lose, and it's hard to get out of that mindset. There was no escape, because of the circumstances.\"\nIn between all the losses, those two seasons forged a feeling that unified the returning players. Barton recalls a brief phone call he had with Elko after he was hired.\n\"He probably doesn't even remember, but I told Coach Elko, 'I speak for a lot of guys -- we're ready to win,'\" Barton recalled. \"He was like, 'Yeah, we'll see who wants to win.'\"\nElko hired Feeley, and the two immediately set out to remake the entire roster through hard work inside the weight room. Carter recalls the very first day of winter conditioning when the players could not get the warm-up quite right.\nFeeley stopped them and told them to start doing up-downs, where you go from a standing position, jump down into a plank, and then jump back up to a standing position.\n\"We got to 10 and I'm like, maybe we'll get to 20,\" Carter said. \"Then we got to 30, and then 40 and it just kept going. I think that set the precedent for how things were going to go.\"\nFeeley knew Duke was a developmental program, but the team was further behind because of all the weight room time it missed. Still, he and Elko did not waver in their plan -- to push the players to their limits through Olympic-style weight training and a heavy dose of competition.\n\"Confidence was at an all-time low. I don't know if I'd ever seen a program like that before,\" Feeley said. \"There are three words on my whiteboard in my office: hope, belief and know. We weren't even in the hope phase. But you saw a group of kids that were starving for a chance to be successful.\"\nSoon, defensive linemen and offensive linemen were competing with each other to see how many reps they could get, or how fast they could lift the bar. Then, players in other position groups got in on raising their max efforts. Within months, Carter said his power clean jumped 50 pounds; offensive tackle Jacob Monk said his went up 70 pounds.\nFeeley says when he arrived, there were seven players who could power clean 300 pounds or more. As of last week, 49 players had hit that benchmark.\nForty-six players from the 2021 roster still play for Duke. Elko has repeatedly told his team from the moment he arrived: \"We're living in the now. We're going to win now. We're not here to rebuild.\"\n\"I don't exactly know when they knew they could be a good team,\" Feeley said. \"I think it happened somewhere around the third or fourth game last year. But when that clicked for them, take the wins and losses out of it. That's really one of the greatest gifts you can give an athlete is the knowledge that they can go out there, and they'll have a real chance to be successful.\"\nBACK IN APRIL, Elko sat in his newly remodeled office -- complete with his 2022 ACC Coach of the Year trophy sitting on a shelf. Elko had just led Duke to a 9-4 turnaround season, and to explain how that happened, he goes over to his computer and starts pulling up numbers.\nThe year before he arrived, Duke had lost all eight ACC games by an average of 31.8 points per game. Turnover margin was minus-7. The defense allowed 206 yards rushing per game, among the worst in the country.\nGains in the weight room would give Duke a foundation. But now would come the more challenging part: learning how to win. Fortunately for the Blue Devils, they had a defensive coordinator for a head coach who could help fix the defense.\nOn offense, they had Leonard. They just had no idea what he would become when the new staff arrived. Elko describes him as \"a diamond that was hidden in this locker room.\" Leonard won the starting job last fall, but so few knew who he was, he was ranked No. 14 among ACC quarterbacks on one preseason list.\nHe didn't need his mom to tell him, \"You suck.\" It was right there on paper.\nLeonard relished seeing that, especially considering his journey to Duke. He planned to play basketball after high school, but a late offer from Cutcliffe changed his mind. Leonard arrived at Duke as a three-star prospect in 2021, largely under-recruited in part because the pandemic made it difficult for anyone to take visits. Asked how a player with prototypical quarterback size at 6-foot-4 and 212 pounds had so few Power 5 offers, Leonard shrugs and says with a sheepish smile, \"I just wasn't very good.\"\nBut from the very start of last season, Leonard proved he was, in fact, very good. He threw for 328 yards and completed 80% of his passes in the season opener against Temple, and showed off his athleticism as a runner, too, adding 64 yards on the ground. He stabilized a position that had been lacking consistency since Daniel Jones' final season in 2018 -- not coincidentally the last time Duke had a winning record.\nLeonard finished with 2,967 yards passing, 20 touchdowns and six interceptions, and led the team in rushing with 699 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns.\n\"Having a quarterback is really important,\" Elko said. \"Twenty-one really talented players without a quarterback doesn't win a lot of games.\"\nWith Leonard guiding the offense, and improving each week, the defense tightened up -- tackling better, playing with more physicality and forcing turnovers. Duke became a top-25 rush defense, and ranked No. 2 in the country in turnover margin, at a whopping plus-16.\n\"A nine-win season, that was a result of just hard work and dedication and passion for winning,\" Barton said. \"I think we might've surprised Coach Elko a little bit with the buy-in there.\"\nNobody was happy with nine wins, though.\n\"We haven't done anything yet,\" Leonard said. \"Our goal is to win the ACC championship and then a national championship. As of right now, we haven't done any of that. So all these wins are good, but 20 years from now, are you going to be remembered? Are you going to be the team that went from 3-9 two years later to win the ACC championship? That's for us to decide.\"\nLEONARD STANDS OUTSIDE the football facility, just in front of Cameron Indoor Stadium where the Blue Devils play basketball. He marvels at the place, even now as a Duke student, as if he cannot believe his good fortune, standing in this spot, in this moment. Maybe that is the basketball player inside him. Maybe that is just who Leonard is, sometimes awestruck and disbelieving that all of this is happening to him.\nAs students and teammates walk past, they all say, \"Hey Riley!\" Nobody shouts, \"You suck!\"\n\"It's funny, the kids on campus have asked me more about my homework assignment and whether I've turned that in than about the Clemson game,\" Leonard says with a laugh, confirming that yes, he did turn in his homework and all is well in class.\nSorry @rileyleonard13_ , We tried! 😞However, you are STILL A LEGEND! 😈Now go study! 📚 pic.twitter.com/CpEdTmhQjX\nAlong with Leonard, Duke returned 16 starters this season. Nearly all of them were on the 2021 roster. Redshirt senior Carter -- known as \"The Mayor\" because he is ubiquitous around campus and is the first three-time captain in program history -- chose to return because he was simply not ready to leave. Barton had offers to go elsewhere but returned to Duke because \"there's no better situation for me as a person and as a football player.\" He, too, projects high on Kiper's board, though at a different position: No. 2 among centers.\nTheir veteran experience has been huge. On the defensive front alone, the four starters have combined to take 4,897 snaps. On the offensive line, Duke entered the year ranked second nationally in games played and games started, behind only Florida State. At receiver, Duke returned 98.7% of its receptions from a year ago.\nElko has strategically used the portal to fill holes on the roster. He went out and signed three defensive backs who have made an immediate impact: Jeremiah Lewis (Northwestern), Al Blades Jr. (Miami) and Myles Jones (Texas A&M). Two starters on the offensive line are transfers, too: center Scott Elliott (Harvard) and right tackle Jake Hornibrook (Stanford).\nBut the truth is Elko has led this turnaround -- and the best 17-game start to a head coaching stint in school history -- with players he already had on the roster.\n\"We feel like we built this from the ground up,\" Carter said. \"So that kind of fight, chip on our shoulder came from our work and especially everything we went through. Somebody had to feel our pain, in a sense, and that was through winning ball games. Playing hard, hitting hard, finishing blocks, dominating blocks, making tackles, finishing tackles. Everything we tried to do and still do today is just show how hard we play and how much we love the game.\"\nCarter says perhaps the biggest compliment of all is the way opponents now respond to Duke. \"There was a certain disrespect we got when teams would play us. Now it's become, 'Oh, you guys are tough.'\"\nElko has repeatedly made it clear he did not take the Duke job to be average. He took it because he believed he could win, and getting off to a 4-0 start this year is just the beginning.\nHis straightforward nature and belief in his players have gotten early results. But there are still big tests remaining on the schedule, starting with Notre Dame -- a team that has not lost a regular-season ACC game since 2017. After an open date, Duke's next five opponents are a combined 18-2.\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nTo keep his players focused on making improvements, Leonard said after every game, Elko spotlights where Duke must get better.\n\"You have about 18 to 24 hours of celebration and then you get brought down to earth again and you realize how far we have to go before we actually accomplish something,\" Leonard said. \"It's his own version of 'You suck,' and he does a pretty good job at it.\"\nElko offers his own interpretation of how \"You suck\" has come to be a defining, motivational phrase -- not only for his quarterback, but for his entire team. It even applies to him, after waiting years for his first opportunity to become a head coach.\n\"We're something a little different,\" Elko said. \"We maybe weren't the highest-rated kids. We probably weren't the highest-rated head coach. But we came together, and we built a very strong chemistry. We worked extremely hard. We became very tough, and that's created a winning formula where we feel very confident every time we go out there.\n\"That's something that's not easy for the masses to pick up on. The masses want star power. They want notoriety. They want those things because those stories are a lot easier to gravitate to. This is really a throwback. This is a group that just works really, really hard and has earned their right to be in the spotlight.\""}
{"title": "'He never believe in my skills': Canelo out to prove that he's still elite", "date": "", "text": "Canelo Alvarez and Jermell Charlo predict how the fight will go before they meet in the ring on Saturday night. (0:51)\nLAS VEGAS -- Canelo Alvarez sized up his next opponent during two separate faceoffs Wednesday and, in between, vowed to show Jermell Charlo \"my real skills.\"\nEmphasis was placed on real, a tacit admission that Alvarez's form over his past three fights wasn't quite his best.\nWhen he's at the top of his game, it's easy to see why Alvarez is an all-time great. He can counterpunch with the best of them off a back foot. He can apply nonstop pressure and cut off the ring with a punishing body attack, as he displayed in the Gennadiy Golovkin rematch.\nAlvarez possesses many layers to his game and an educated boxing mind, as evidenced by his strategy to target Callum Smith's left arm to neutralize his jab. The result: a detached bicep for the Englishman.\nAlvarez remains the singular face of boxing, a global superstar and ESPN's No. 4 pound-for-pound boxer. And he's eager to put that trio of lackluster performances (by his standard) behind him.\nThree days ahead of his third defense of the undisputed super middleweight championship, Alvarez oozed confidence that he would eliminate all the whispers that at 33 and after 63 pro fights, he was on the decline.\n\"I agree that a couple fights I don't look the same, but that doesn't mean other things,\" Alvarez told ESPN on Wednesday. \"I feel fresh, I feel young and I feel strong. I feel in my prime, and you will see Saturday.\"\nAlvarez was ESPN's top pound-for-pound boxer after he scored an 11th-round TKO of Caleb Plant to collect all four belts at 168 pounds, one of four weight classes where he's won world titles. That was November 2021.\nAlvarez returned for a second fight at 175 pounds for a May 2022 fight against Dmitry Bivol and was soundly outpointed by the slick-boxing Russian. The setback was Alvarez's first since his 2013 defeat to Floyd Mayweather and knocked him off the pound-for-pound pedestal.\nAlvarez returned four months later to conclude his trilogy with a 40-year-old Golovkin in a unanimous decision, but Alvarez again didn't look like himself. He faded down the stretch and didn't seem to fight with his trademark ferocity and relentless combinations.\nAlvarez revealed afterward that he faced both Bivol and GGG with a badly injured left wrist and underwent surgery in October. He returned to Guadalajara for a Mexico homecoming win over John Ryder in May, his first fight following the procedure on his wrist.\nRyder is a solid if unspectacular fighter, and he proved to be tough as nails as he absorbed a broken nose and a knockdown during the 12-round beating. But the Englishman held his own in exchanges with Alvarez and left the Mexican star with a marked face.\n\"He's not that easy, look easy, but he's a little tricky,\" Alvarez said. \" ... I'm happy with what I did in that fight.\"\nAlvarez was rehabbing his surgically repaired hand ahead of the clash with Ryder and that meant he couldn't train as intensely as he liked. Now confident his lead weapon is 100%, Alvarez has amplified his training regimen ahead of Saturday's fight with Charlo.\nInstead of training full-time near his home in San Diego, Alvarez moved camp to the mountains of Truckee, California, near Lake Tahoe for the last eight weeks, according to trainer and manager Eddy Reynoso.\n\"We have left behind the injuries and all the setbacks that we had before,\" said Reynoso in remarks translated from Spanish. \"Now we're 100 percent and ... we're going to prove to you just how motivated we are by giving the fans a great show, a great fight.\"\nAlvarez realized the benefit of training in altitude during his one month in Guadalajara before he faced Ryder. He replicated the effect with Truckee, 5,000-plus feet above sea level, to improve his conditioning ahead of the fight with Charlo.\nCharlo is in his prime, a 33-year-old resident of Houston, and the undisputed junior middleweight champion. He's skilled and has an explosive counterpunch. Charlo has defeated every fighter he's ever faced, with stoppage wins in rematches with Tony Harrison and Brian Castano.\n\"Canelo is a different type of fighter that you just don't take for granted,\" said Charlo, who will be stepping up to the first elite opponent of his career. \"He's done everything in the sport of boxing. He has nothing to prove, everything to gain to me.\"\nCharlo, though, has been inactive. He hasn't competed since May 2022, when he stopped Castano in Round 10. And Charlo is coming off a serious hand injury of his own. He was slated to fight rising Australian star Tim Tszyu in January before he underwent surgery to repair a broken left hand.\nCharlo also has never competed above 154 pounds and will move up two weight classes for a shot at boxing's top star. It's a chance for Charlo to end Canelo's run at the top of the sport and an opportunity for Alvarez to prove that injuries, not decline, led to those off nights.\n\"He's calling me out for a long time, for 10 years maybe, and he never believe in my skills,\" said Canelo, who is nearly a 5-1 favorite. \"These kind of fights, big fights, motivate myself.\n\"... When everybody feels my power, they are surprised. ... I think he can handle the weight, too, because he's taller. He's strong. ... I think [the extra weight] is going to be good for him. ... Maybe he struggled to make 154.\"\nJermell wasn't even the original Charlo opponent. It was his brother, Jermall, who was first tabbed as Alvarez's foe for the first of his three-fight deal with PBC.\nThe bigger twin brother, the WBC middleweight titleholder, hasn't competed since June 2021 as he dealt with a personal matter, so Jermell stepped in.\n\"They look the same,\" Alvarez said. \"Same size, same everything. I don't really care which Charlo brother it is.\"\nIf Alvarez can dominate Jermell Charlo and stop him, it will be hard to doubt that he's still in his prime. But if Alvarez struggles, the whispers will grow louder than ever.\nNot that Alvarez has anything to prove at this stage of his career, with hundreds of millions of dollars earned and his Hall of Fame legacy secure.\n\"I think right now I feel 100 percent confident with my hand, and that's all matters,\" Alvarez said. \"And when you feel confident, it's something else. And you will see Saturday night because I can say a lot of things right now, this and that, but at the end of the day, Saturday, you're going to see.\""}

It will be a rare meeting of heavyweights both ranked in the pound-for-pound top 10 (Usyk is No 3; Fury No. 6.)\nBefore he meets his toughest challenge yet, Fury will fight former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou on Oct. 28, also in Saudi Arabia, in what amounts to a tuneup for the Usyk showdown.\nWho will hold the edge when Fury and Usyk fight for the heavyweight crown? What happens if Ngannou scores the unthinkable upset? Let's break it down:\nLegacy ... bragging rights as the greatest heavyweight of this era.\nFury and Usyk are already headed for the Hall of Fame on the first ballot, but what transpires in the ring will go a long way toward cementing their place on the mythical all-time great heavyweight list.\nFury received ample criticism when the Usyk fight fell apart in March, only for Fury to sign on for a bout with an MMA fighter a few months later. Now, Fury has made good by delivering not one but two marquee heavyweight events months apart.\nHe can use the Ngannou bout as a way to shake off any ring rust and get into peak shape for Usyk, a smaller, faster heavyweight who will look to beat Fury to the punch.\nIf Fury can turn back Usyk -- he'll surely be a slight betting favorite to do so -- his legacy will be secured as the greatest heavyweight of his generation. Wladimir Klitschko's run was longer, but Fury ended that reign in 2015 and with a win over Usyk, would add another Hall of Famer to his resume.\nFor Usyk, a win would be even more monumental. He would follow in the great Evander Holyfield's footsteps, another fighter who ruled over the cruiserweight division and went on to score a career-defining heavyweight title win, too. Holyfield upset Mike Tyson in a heavyweight championship thriller in 1996 before the infamous \"Bite Fight\" rematch.\nUsyk, with a victory, would make a strong case to claim the ESPN pound-for-pound throne occupied by Terence Crawford.\nStephen A. Smith and Molly Qerim sit down with Mike Tyson and Francis Ngannou to discuss Ngannou's mindset and strategy going into his first-ever boxing match vs. Tyson Fury.\nNgannou is one of the biggest names in combat sports, and his fight with Fury will only serve to build interest in the showdown with Usyk.\nBut there's still some danger anytime a boxer has two fights lined up in succession. No one is giving Ngannou, who's never boxed before, much of a chance against Fury, an all-time great, when they meet in a nontitle fight. But this is the heavyweight division and stranger things have happened.\nIt's an incredible long shot, but Ngannou is a massive man (6-foot-4, 257 pounds) with real power in both hands. And if he land a clear shot, who knows what happens?\nFar more possible than a Ngannou upset: the prospect of injury for Fury. This is still a fight, and if Fury suffers a cut or injury, that could delay the clash with Usyk, which could take place as soon as Dec. 23.\n\"Tyson Fury is one of the best boxers of all time,\" former UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic told ESPN's Marc Raimondi. Miocic defeated Ngannou in 2018 but was knocked out in the rematch. \"But listen, it's a fight. Francis hits hard and he moves well. I just hope he shocks the world.\"\nWhen it comes to undisputed title fights, the rules of the four major sanctioning bodies usually loom over the proceedings. But no one is going to get in the way of the rich sanctioning fees that accompany such a super fight.\nThe WBA mandatory was sorted when Usyk survived a low blow to knock out Daniel Dubois in Round 9 in August. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman has already said Fury has no mandatory at the moment.\nFilip Hrgovic is the IBF's No. 1 contender and is pushing for his shot now, but he will have to wait until Fury and Usyk meet in the ring first.\nZhilei Zhang, following his third-round TKO victory over Joe Joyce in the rematch last week, is the WBO interim heavyweight titleholder. That could land him a shot at the winner in the near future. Like Fury, Zhang is promoted by Frank Warren.\nFury is a rare talent, a boxer who can flick a pinpoint jab and box off the back foot with crisp shots. He's incredibly light on his feet for a 6-foot-9, 270-pound man and showed off his ability when he outboxed Klitschko in 2015.\nOver the past few years, Fury has adapted his style. Now, he prefers to maul his opponents, using his immense size and weight in the clinch to drain his foes and break them down. Fury used the strategy to great effect in the second and third fights with Deontay Wilder -- brutal beatdowns of arguably the biggest puncher in heavyweight history.\nIt's likely Fury will employ the same approach against Usyk.\nWhy attempt to outbox a masterful boxer in Usyk when Fury can use what figures to be an extra 50 pounds in weight on fight night? He can lean on Usyk and sap the energy out of his legs.\nUsyk, meanwhile, will surely use angles and precise footwork to time Fury with counter shots and stay out of danger. Usyk needs to keep the fight in the center of the ring and avoid being bullied into the ropes. He already has experience fighting a bigger, stronger man from his 24 rounds with Anthony Joshua, who might be a bigger puncher than Fury. Though he's surely not on Fury's level as a boxer.\nUsyk is a southpaw, too, which has given Fury issues in the past. Look no further than the Otto Wallin fight, where he struggled before scoring a decision victory.\nThis shapes up as a fight either guy could win, but the slight edge goes to Fury."}
{"title": "Game time is down! Stolen bases are up! What we learned from Year 1 of MLB's rule changes", "date": "", "text": "At the beginning of the season, the implementation of new rule changes dominated the conversation surrounding baseball.\nThere was a pitch clock for the first time ever -- probably the most controversial of all the changes, though a month into the season, a few MLB players had come to appreciate it -- and the bigger bases went viral on social media as they were compared to pizza boxes. There was also the elimination of the shift and a limit to how many times a pitcher could disengage from the rubber.\nNow, as we near the end of the 2023 regular season -- and prepare for the first MLB postseason with the new rules in play -- the impact these changes have had on the game of baseball itself has become incredibly clear.\nGame time is down, while all the things that make baseball fun are up. With 97% of the season completed, batting average is up six points (.249) from 2022, batting average on balls in play is up seven points (.297) and on-base percentage is up eight points (.320). We also saw an increase in runs per game (from 8.6 last season to 9.3 in 2023) and stolen base attempts (1.4 to 1.8). On top of that, average attendance is up 9.15%, the biggest one-year increase across the league in 30 years, according to MLB.\nNow that we have almost a full 162-game slate to draw from, we asked ESPN MLB experts Buster Olney, Jesse Rogers and Alden Gonzalez to give their takeaways on the rule changes -- from what they have heard from players and managers to one rule change they think could come to baseball next.\nOlney: Twenty-four. That's the number of minutes that the average game time has been reduced by, which is a monumental change. There are still nine innings and 54 outs, but that action is crammed into a game duration that is 15% shorter than it was in the past. It's clear from attendance figures and television ratings that fans have responded to the new product.\nRogers: Some would assume the answer would be time of game, but that doesn't impact the on-field product. Last year, the Texas Rangers led the majors in stolen bases with 128. This season, nine teams already have more than that number and two more are likely to surpass it as well. And the success rate on steals, 80.2%, is the highest in the history of the game. \nGonzalez: The increase in stolen-base frequency serves as a good gauge because it's a product of several new rules -- the bigger bases, the limits on disengagements and, to some degree, the pitch clock. MLB noted that stolen-base attempts increased to 1.8 per game in 2023, up from 1.4 in 2022. If you don't think that's a lot -- well, it is. Fans want shorter games at a quicker pace, certainly. But the stolen base was a real void in recent years. It's all the way back now, and that's a really good thing.\nHere's everything you need to know as the regular season winds down, from current playoff matchups to league races to the postseason schedule.\nMLB playoff tracker »\nOlney: A few players and managers -- most of them older guys -- quietly complain about some of the new rules, especially the pitch clock. But the vast majority of those in the industry (players, coaches, managers, umpires, clubhouse attendants, stadium workers) seem to love the changes. Especially the shorter games.\nRogers: Pitchers would like the ability to step off with no one on base without it being counted as a mound visit. Hitters get a timeout with runners on or when the bases are empty. Why can't a pitcher?\nGonzalez: I heard several complaints from players about the new rules early in the season -- pitchers on having to juggle the pitch clock and the disengagement limits while also focusing on how to attack their opponents, and hitters on needing more time to get settled into the batter's box. But pitch timer violations went from 0.87 per game within the first 100 games to 0.34 per game in a very recent stretch of 100 games, according to MLB.com. In other words: Players adjust.\nOlney: The young fans, I think, have benefitted the most. My 19-year-old sports crazy son is a great focus group of one for me, and perhaps his experience this year mirrors that of a lot of his generation. In the past, the idea of sitting through a whole game was not something that ever interested him because he felt the action lagged. He hated waiting for slow-working pitchers to get on the mound. But this year, with the average game time comparable to an NBA or hockey game, he constantly watched games from beginning to end.\nThose who benefited the least: hitters. I think there was a broad assumption that position players would get a little more production boost in light of the shift restrictions, but that really didn't happen. Until baseball makes rules limiting the high volume of relief pitchers, there probably won't be a big spike in offense.\nRogers: There's little doubt that anyone who is a stolen base threat has benefitted. Nico Hoerner jumped from 20 stolen bases in 2022 to over 40 this season. Ha-Seong Kim from 12 to 36. Willi Castro from nine to over 30. The list goes on and on of players who are setting career highs in steals due to the bigger bases and the new disengagement rules.\nWe created a new set of accolades to honor the best of the regular season before October arrives.\n Passan's 2023 awards »\nGonzalez: I'll throw another group that benefited into the mix: left-handed hitters. Not all of them, of course, but the shift restrictions have prevented teams from implementing extreme shifts on pull-happy lefties. Batting average on balls in play by left-handed hitters was .285 from 2020 to 2022. This year, it's .295. Corey Seager was looked upon as somebody who would greatly benefit from the shift restrictions, and he'd be making a serious run at MVP right now if not for Shohei Ohtani (another left-handed hitter, by the way).\nOlney: For years, we've heard complaints about how some fans couldn't stay up to watch the entirety of playoff and World Series games that continued past midnight. Well, this will be a different experience. Because of the extra commercial time, postseason games will still be longer than regular season games -- but not always the 4 1⁄2-hour behemoths we've seen in past Octobers. And teams will run more in the postseason than they did during the regular season, taking advantage of the limits on pick-off attempts.\nRogers: Here's how Atlanta Braves starter Spencer Strider thinks the new rules will impact baseball in October: \"The strategy is what's at stake more than the effects of the rule. I see it as we have a really big pitch coming up and everyone's a little too nervous to take a moment or take a mound visit, especially early in the game. And you make a pitch that we wouldn't have otherwise made had we had the time to talk about it.\"\nGonzalez: That remains to be seen. A lot has been said -- by players and some of their agents -- about lengthening or eliminating the pitch clock in the playoffs, or perhaps just in the late innings. That won't happen, of course. And while I understand the need for continuity, I would hate to see a postseason game decided by a pitch timer violation. It's fine if it happens occasionally within the 2,430 games that are played from April to September. But not in October. Hopefully the players are adjusted enough by then to render this moot.\nOlney: The sport desperately needs to restore the preeminence of starting pitchers. For the players' association, it's an important financial issue because, historically, starting pitchers have been instrumental in pushing salary ceilings. For MLB, there is a need for day-to-day headliners to market the sport -- matchups akin to Pedro Martinez vs. Roger Clemens, Madison Bumgarner vs. Clayton Kershaw.\nWhether your favorite team is an October favorite or playing out the string, every club has had something go right ... and wrong.\n Stock Watch »\nThe parade of relief pitchers designed to exploit matchup advantages is not a compelling product -- just as four-hour games did not make for a compelling product -- and the lords of the sport know this. But making changes in this realm will be very hard, given that relief pitchers now make up an enormous proportion of the union.\nRogers: Automatic balls and strikes still need some perfecting, so some smaller rules are in play, such as the runner's lane to first. This has always been confusing when it comes to calling interference on the runner. The league is likely to tweak the rule so that the burden isn't completely on the runner, who isn't attempting to interfere with the play in the first place.\nGonzalez: Full-on automatic balls and strikes might still be a ways away, but I can definitely see a challenge system for balls and strikes coming in the near future. It's a nice, happy medium. Umpires get the vast majority of these calls right, regardless of what you might interpret from social media; what we need to eliminate are the obvious misses, especially in critical spots. The challenge system does that, while implementing another cool strategic component to the game. It's also incredibly fast."}
{"title": "Why Núñez is key to Liverpool vs. Spurs, lessons from Napoli and Osimhen troubles", "date": "", "text": "Julien Laurens explains why Napoli's social media posts mocking Victor Osimhen couldn't have come at a worse time. (2:00)\nWelcome to Onside/Offside! Each week, Luis Miguel Echegaray discusses the latest from the soccer world, including standout performances, games you might have missed and what to keep an eye on in the coming days. This week, as the U.S. continues to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, LME will kick things off by highlighting a Latin American player that deserves some extra attention.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nLiverpool's visit to Tottenham on Saturday is set to be an entertaining spectacle, notably supported by the fact that these two teams -- undefeated in the league -- are currently playing some great football thanks to two forward-thinking managers who preach playing-style philosophies based on fluidity and overloading their attack. They are attractive going forward and resilient when facing adversity.\nLiverpool -- who have now scored three goals in six separate matches in all competitions (five consecutive) -- could go top of the table with a victory coupled with a poor result from Man City (they travel to Wolves). Spurs could jump to second and leap frog Jurgen Klopp's side with a win if Brighton fail to beat Aston Villa.\nBut allow me to digress from the match preview and focus on a particular player, Núñez, who this season is finally demonstrating the landscape of his talents.\nThe assist.The finish.The celebrations. 🗣️ ¡VAAAAAMOS! 🗣️ @Darwinn99 pic.twitter.com/tEUH1vkAos\nIn eight matches in all competitions, the 24-year-old Uruguayan has four goals and two assists, but what's more impressive is that he's done this in 336 minutes. That comes to an approximate goal contribution every 56 minutes. Now, let's remember that he's only started three times so far, and only twice in the Premier League. He has made the most of his minutes, and his goals have also been ridiculously good. How about the acrobatic volley against West Ham? Or his clutch-finishes against Newcastle United?\nWhat's been most impressive, however, is his work off the ball.\n\"And the defensive work he puts in now, that's probably the main difference,\" said Jurgen Klopp last weekend about Núñez. \"He always wanted it, but he was less coordinated. Now it looks much better, we found a way that we can do it around him.\"\nThe thing about Núñez is that he is a hybrid, a Frankenstein-like assortment of contrasting attributes. He is a technical wonder but he is also physically raw. Imagine the grace of a ballet dancer but the untrained power of a bucking bull. He isn't a blank canvas but rather a sculpture not quite refined. In many ways, he hasn't reached his peak and this makes him dangerous because an unfinished product who is yet to produce his full potential should be alarming to opponents and music to Klopp's ears.\nHe is a chaos striker, immediately disrupting a defender's rhythm with his pressing. Let's not forget that Marcelo Bielsa is also now his national team manager for Uruguay, and this can only help him become a more dangerous disruptor. Now, as Klopp said, Liverpool have a team that can work around Núñez erratic energy, thanks to a smarter, more organized and dynamic midfield including the brilliant Dominik Szoboszlai and Wataru Endō, who in my opinion is one of the most underrated signings of the season. The chaos now has order.\nMany questioned Núñez arrival to Merseyside last summer, specifically because of his €75m ($78.59m) price tag and the fact that he arrived at the same time as another physically dominant striker in Erling Haaland. But I said it then and I'll say it again: With the Uruguayan, patience was needed and now that Núñez is more familiar with the league and has acclimated to his team's tactics, we will see a more complete player. As long as he stays fit, we'll see great things from the former Peñarol man in whatever capacity.\nThe 2023-2024 Women's Super League season kicks off this Sunday when Aston Villa host Man United and there are plenty of things to look forward to, including the growth of superstar talent in the league. Just under 100 players who will feature in the league this season played at this summer's World Cup so the quality throughout different clubs is evident.\nEngland forward Alessia Russo left Man United for Arsenal, who also picked up the talented young Australian midfielder Kyra Cooney-Cross, whilst the Red Devils replaced Russo with Japan's Hinata Miyazawa, who won the Golden Boot at the World Cup. Meanwhile, Villa strengthened across the lineup to help support their main woman and last season's WSL player of the season Rachel Daly, whilst Man City made one signing, but it was reportedly a pricey one (a British record fee of £300,000) by bringing midfielder Jill Roord back to the league from Wolfsburg.\nThe #BarclaysWSL is back, with the world's best players ready for another epic title race. This is #WhereGreatnessLives. New Season drops 1st October. Watch every match on @SkySports, @BBC or The FA Player. pic.twitter.com/aB0US3SFW1\nThen there's the Goliath Chelsea, who have won the last four league titles. Is there anyone that can stop them? Man United got close last time around but in the end it wasn't to be as Emma Hayes's side proved to be too strong. There have been plenty of changes in then Blues' squad -- both incoming and outgoing -- but they once again remain favorites.\nPernille Harder and Magdalena Eriksson left for Bayern Munich but Chelsea brought in some American flair in Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel. German midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken and England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton are also new members of the team, as well as the Canadian defender Ashley Lawrence, who joins from PSG. When you add them to the likes of Sam Kerr, Lauren James, Fran Kirby and Millie Bright, it's difficult to go against them. Emma Hayes, however, is the main driver towards their success. Her managerial prowess is unmatched and if the squad delivers, it's because of her leadership. Can they add more trophies -- notably the Champions League -- to their campaign? Time will tell.\nFinally, let's hope to see more record numbers in attendance, especially as clubs are now opening their main stadiums for the women. Last season's highest number was the north London derby at the Emirates, where 47,367 people watched the Gunners win 4-0 against their rivals, but I think that number will be broken. Man United will host Man City at Old Trafford this season so there's a chance that could be the one that breaks the record.\nNapoli's social media team suffered high levels of criticism this week after the club's TikTok account posted two videos mocking Osimhen, forcing his agent Roberto Calenda to threaten with legal action. Despite the controversy and dispute between club and player, Osimhen scored on Wednesday night as his manager Rudi Garcia confirmed the Nigerian striker is \"invested 100%\" in the club, despite the player deleting images of him in his Napoli shirt shortly after the TikTok videos.\n\"I can assure you that Victor loves this jersey,\" Garcia said after the club's victory over Udinese.\nNapoli issued a statement saying they \"never intended to offend\" Osimhen, and it seems this will eventually die down and both parties will kiss and make up. However, I think this needs to be a lesson for all social media managers who handle accounts for professional clubs: Understand the responsibility of your job.\nGab Marcotti reacts to Napoli's now-deleted social media posts that made fun of star striker Victor Osimhen.\nI teach a class every semester at my former Graduate School of Journalism on the psychological undertones of social media and one major lesson I like to tell the students is that managing a social media account requires two important principles: self-control and trustworthiness.\nWhen you handle a club's account, these principles are even more critical. For most clubs (and sports websites) and their social media platforms, the need to generate likes or views is more important than meaningful engagement and this can sometimes be a problem.\nThe road runner speed of consumption based on TikTok trends and viral-searched content can be problematic, hence the Osimhen debacle. Why would you want to troll/abuse/mock -- whatever you want to call it -- your own player for the sake of clicks? It's a self-destructive strategy and one that breaks the trust between club, audience and in this case, the player. And not just any player, your BEST player. Your star striker and hero who helped the club lift the Serie A title last season after a three-decade wait.\nSo, to those that work in the industry, take this as a lesson. Social media in sports can be a place that offers opportunity for meaningful engagement, connection and social conscience whilst simultaneously doing good work (see AS Roma's strategy). Not everything has to come at the expense of someone else's misfortune, especially if it's your own player.\nI hate to tell you I told you so...but I told you so. Last month in our Premier League preview column, I commented on the fact that the new EFL time-wasting regulations (referees to add minutes on time lost due to goal celebrations or any other sort of in-game antics) are a double-edged solution because more minutes also means an even bigger risk for injuries.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Thomas Partey, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka missed the Carabao Cup fixture against Brentford and the latter is questionable for this Saturday's game against Bournemouth.\nHarvey Barnes also limped off for Newcastle United during last weekend's emphatic victory over Sheffield United. Barnes could be out for months. Chelsea's list remains substantial (Ben Chilwell came off injured in the Carabao Cup) as well as Man City, Man United and Aston Villa's (Leon Bailey was substituted in the 28th minute during the League Cup), while Brighton also have key players on the sideline.\nI remain stubborn on this. Something has to be done about the calendar, domestic and international. There's just too much football being played and yes, even though we love this game and all the action that comes with it, I'd much rather focus on a player's wellbeing so they can be at their best -- mentally and physically -- in order to deliver. Over and over again, it's clear that in terms of the footballing schedule, less is more.\nAfter their U.S. Open Cup loss to Houston Dynamo, Inter Miami, who played without an injured Lionel Messi, welcome NYCFC this weekend for an important game that dictates their MLS playoffs hopes. But I'm here to discuss the season ticket prices for next season, which were recently announced by the club.\nNaturally, due to Messi's arrival, the expectation was a rise in prices but fans have voiced their anger towards the spike. This season, the cheapest season ticket came to $485 but next year it is $884. In the northwest midfield area, the seats are priced from $4,420 to $7,650 with special access to various areas of the ground. These numbers also doubled from this year. Pitch-level season tickets on the east sideline include more access and they're priced more than $13,000. Boxes? More than $40,000.\nHere's the thing, I understand the need to maximize Messi's arrival and in the end, this is a business. However, season ticket holders are core fans, because they are the ones who were there before Messi and will be there after he leaves. They are the pulse, the beat and the drum. The club -- like any other -- has to be loyal to their presence because without them, there's no club to build.\nThese prices, especially at a stadium that's not even their intended proper ground, is not the way to pay gratitude for a community that's vital towards the club's success. I hope they rethink and adjust these numbers."}
{"title": "Margin of error for Messi and Miami to make MLS playoffs is rapidly shrinking", "date": "", "text": "MLS players swap stories about their experiences with asking Lionel Messi for his game jersey. (3:01)\nCrunch time has arrived in the 2023 Major League Soccer season as the chances to lock down a place in the playoffs grow fewer by the week. For Argentina superstar Lionel Messi and Inter Miami, it is truly last-chance saloon.\nFollowing a 1-1 draw at Orlando City on Sunday, Messi & Co. find themselves five points and five places behind New York City FC for the ninth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Not ideal.\nFortunately for the Herons, they have two games in hand, so there is ample opportunity to springboard up the standings. Using the typical 43-point plateau that has historically served as the MLS playoff cut line, Inter Miami needs to take 12 points from the team's final five matches to squeeze into the playoffs.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nHere is where things get complicated for Inter Miami: With Messi and star full-back Jordi Alba not even on the bench for Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup final loss against Houston, the former Barcelona teammates' availability for the most important part of the regular season is now in question. Miami isn't quite the same team without Messi; in the 10 games before Messi arrived this summer, Miami lost six and won only one, but after his arrival Miami went on a 10-game unbeaten streak, winning six.\nWith details about Messi's fitness so murky, it's impossible to gauge when he might be available again, if at all, this season. If Miami makes the playoffs, it certainly seems to raise the chances of seeing Messi again.\nFirst things first, though: Inter Miami has to win four games to even have the conversation of a possible Messi return for the playoffs. That will be easier said than done.\nMiami's final MLS playoff push begins this Saturday with a home date against the aforementioned NYCFC. It hasn't been the easiest season in Gotham, but NYCFC has managed to find one of its best runs of form of the entire season at the right time, taking 10 points in the past five matches and conceding just one goal in that span.\nSimply put, Inter Miami cannot afford to drop points on Saturday because the margin for error is so thin. The remainder of the schedule suggests as much.\nAfter NYCFC, Inter Miami goes up against a Chicago Fire side that hasn't won since before Leagues Cup, so logic dictates that three points are very attainable there.\nBut it is three days later, Oct. 7, that dictates this entire playoff-seeking exercise for Inter Miami. That's when Supporters' Shield leader FC Cincinnati comes to town, and no question that Cincy's players would love nothing more than to avenge their U.S. Open Cup semifinal penalty shootout defeat with a resounding win in Fort Lauderdale, possibly even winning the Supporters' Shield in the process.\nBasically, if Miami head coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino wanted to go full NBA and \"schedule a loss\" for the sake of rest, this is the one to do it. To reach the 43-point threshold, though, this would be the only loss Miami could afford.\nWhat then follows are Miami's final two games of the season, and in a curious twist, they will be a pair of meetings with Charlotte FC, a team that only joined MLS last year, missing the playoffs.\nHerculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nAdding uncertainty is that the first match against Charlotte takes place in Florida on Oct. 18, just one day after Argentina is scheduled to be in Lima to play Peru in a CONMEBOL World Cup qualifier. Messi's availability for anything, whether Inter Miami or Albiceleste, is unknown, but his inkling is to always be with his national team, no matter what.\nThat will have to be hashed out by Messi, Martino and Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni, but from the Inter Miami perspective, those are three points that have to be pocketed. Doing it without Messi would be all the more difficult, but if the loss in Cincinnati transpires, this Charlotte game is a must-win.\nFinally, MLS Decision Day will arrive three days later on Oct. 21 to close out the regular season, and if Inter Miami had gotten the necessary results and Messi's health is good, it just might be the first time Messi gets a taste of an MLS specialty: flying black pellets on an artificial turf field.\nThe second date with Charlotte will be away at Bank of America Stadium, fake grass and all. For a Miami team that has been battling fatigue in recent weeks and its star not at 100%, this will be a test of mettle to come away with a full three points. That is all assuming Inter Miami can even get to the final day of the regular season with a chance at reaching the playoffs, of course.\nThere is a lot of work to do, beginning on Saturday against NYCFC. With Messi's injury quandary, fatigue settling into the team, an upcoming schedule with a behemoth like FC Cincinnati and the curveball of the international window, the journey north of the 43-point playoff line leaves almost no room for error."}

Jon Jones ruled at light heavyweight. Israel Adesanya was the newly crowned king of middleweights. And, well, let's just cut to the chase and say that all 12 of the fight promotion's weight classes had champions who do not reign today.\nA lot changes at the top of this sport. A lot changes down the ladder as well. That same month, four years ago, ESPN published our first ranking of the top 25 MMA fighters under age 25. None of those who made the list were champions -- they were young fighters who'd caught the eye of our panelists and appeared to be poised for a bright future. How'd that work out?

A graduation of sorts for some of the top prospects in the sport -- but who has the best grades?\nEditor's note: ESPN's voting panel includes Brett Okamoto, Marc Raimondi, Jeff Wagenheim, Andres Waters, Andrew Feldman and Eddie Maisonet III.\nUFC men's bantamweight champion\n2019 Rank: 2\nRecord since 2019: 7-1, 1 NC\nNo one in the sport has a higher ceiling when it comes to stardom than O'Malley. The UFC has recognized it, and O'Malley is getting pushed as if he's the second coming of Conor McGregor. While that level of mainstream fame might be impossible to come by, O'Malley is the closest thing the promotion has to Notorious 2.0 after he knocked out Aljamain Sterling to win the bantamweight title at UFC 292 on Aug. 19. The entertainment magazine Variety did a cover story on the TKO merger last week and gracing the cover were WWE champion Roman Reigns and O'Malley.\nWhile O'Malley will be a name the UFC will be riding on at the outset of this new publicly traded company, the question is what will be next for him. It seems pretty clear O'Malley's first title defense will come against rival Marlon \"Chito\" Vera, the only man to defeat O'Malley in the Octagon. Could that be set up for UFC 300 on a loaded card? Will O'Malley carry his own pay-per-view before or after that? There's no wrong answer necessarily. But regardless of what gets decided, it's abundantly clear O'Malley is the UFC's new \"guy.\" -- Raimondi\nUFC men's bantamweight\n2019 Rank: 19\nRecord since 2019: 4-0\nThere is no ceiling on Nurmagomedov's talent. He's still only 27, and it looks like he'd be ready to hold a championship right now if given the opportunity.\nLike his retired cousin, Khabib, he's somehow managed to stay perfect in a sport rife with potential pitfalls. The UFC has bought into Nurmagomedov's potential and is more than willing to give him a big fight. He was booked to fight Cory Sandhagen in August before a shoulder injury forced him to withdraw. Before that, the UFC discussed pairing him against Merab Dvalishvili. He's expected to return in the first quarter of 2024 and go into the year as one of -- if not the -- marquee names to watch. His game is balanced and well-rounded. He's a far more dangerous striker than Khabib, and he carries the Dagestani wrestling pedigree to go along with it. His next fight will be a big one, and you can bet the UFC will put it in a showcase spot to build his name. -- Okamoto\nESPN's No. 5 ranked featherweight\n2019 Rank: 1\nRecord since 2019: 5-1\nMcKee was No. 1 in our 2019 rankings because he appeared closer to gold than any other young fighter. He had just won his opening bout in the Bellator Featherweight World Grand Prix by knockout -- in 8 seconds. How'd he justify his rankings? McKee breezed through the rest of the tournament, finishing everyone in his way. That included fellow finalist Patricio \"Pitbull\" Freire, who also held the Bellator title at the time of their 2021 bout. So winning the tourney didn't just earn McKee a shot at the championship. It made him the champ. McKee lost the belt to Pitbull in a rematch last year. That set McKee's eye on a new frontier: the lightweight division. He won two fights at 155 pounds to earn a spot in the Lightweight World Grand Prix, where in the first round, he would face another Freire -- Patricio's brother, Patricky, a former champ. But an injury scuttled that July fight and McKee's participation in the tourney. To begin the road back to opportunity, he will take on Sidney Outlaw at Bellator 301 on Nov. 17. -- Wagenheim\nESPN's No. 9 ranked lightweight\n2019 Rank: 25\nRecord since 2019: 6-1\nThis may be a bit of hyperbole, but few things outside the Octagon are more difficult in MMA than finding an opponent for Tsarukyan. The UFC and Tsarukyan's manager, Daniel Rubenstein, have their work cut out for them. Tsarukyan is a guy who made his UFC debut against Islam Makhachev of all people and made Makhachev, now the UFC lightweight champion, work for every position in a close decision. With his dominant wrestling and grappling and budding power, Tsarukyan is a nightmare matchup for anyone at 155 pounds. He has legitimate championship potential.\nTsarukyan doesn't have a fight booked right now, but he's sitting at No. 9 in ESPN's divisional rankings and should be looking at a big fight next. He's probably one or two wins away from a title shot. But in Tsarukyan's case, that could take a year because there aren't many takers to get into the Octagon with the guy. Hopefully, things open up and we get to see him show his skills against the best fighters in the division soon enough. --Raimondi\nUFC men's bantamweight\n2019 Rank: 8\nRecord since 2019: 5-2-1\nSomehow, Song is still a few months away from his 26th birthday, yet he has nearly 30 professional fights under his belt -- including 12 in the UFC. That is a wealth of experience for his age, which should complement his growing skillset and physical maturity nicely in the coming years. Whereas his counterpart in the top-5 of this list, Nurmagomedov, is widely viewed as a future champion, Song isn't quite on that level. He's still a wait-and-see prospect. Does he have the ability to truly give the very best of this division a run for its money? Last year, he fought Sandhagen evenly through four rounds before the fight was called off due to a cut. The fact he was able to fight evenly with Sandhagen through 20 minutes shows how good this Chinese contender is, but it was still a loss. He's considered a threat at 135, but a bonafide future champ? We'll still have to see. -- Okamoto\nBellator featherweight\n2019 Rank: 13\nRecord since 2019: 8-1\nThere are young fighters and then there are young fighters. When Bellator signed Pico in 2014, he was 17 years old. \"Simply put, Aaron has all the makings of MMA's next great superstar,\" company president Scott Coker gushed, \"and to have him here at Bellator MMA is something special.\" Pico was a two-time medalist at the World Junior Wrestling Championships and would later just miss out on making the U.S. Olympic team. He did not make his pro MMA debut until 2017 -- and lost via submission in just 24 seconds. The hype train was derailed. There have been other bumps in the road, but ever since suffering two knockout losses in 2019, Pico has won eight of nine and is on the verge of challenging for the featherweight title. -- Wagenheim\nUFC lightweight\n2019 Rank: 21\nRecord since 2019: 5-2\nIn terms of pure in-cage potential, Turner's ceiling is as high as anyone's on this list. He's still just 28 years old. At 6-foot-3 with a 72-inch reach, Turner is a difficult stylistic matchup for anyone in the UFC lightweight division. He's shown power as a striker, along with durability and composure against top fighters. Turner has lost two straight but consider the circumstances. Both were split decisions he absolutely could have won. And losing to Dan Hooker and Mateusz Gamrot is nothing to be ashamed about. Turner very well could be fighting for a UFC championship one day. --Raimondi\nUFC women's flyweight\n2019 Rank: 6\nRecord since 2019: 5-2\nFor a minute, this train was going off the rails back in 2021. Barber hit her first road bump in 2020, when she suffered her first loss to Roxanne Modafferi and a torn ACL. After nearly two years off, she returned and lost to Alexa Grasso, who was only 3-3 in her last six fights going into that matchup. She was not the Grasso we've come to know today as the UFC's flyweight champ. And then immediately after that, Barber went on to barely squeak out a split decision over Miranda Maverick, in a fight many thought she lost.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Lowe: Breaking down the Lillard trade »\n• QB Hot Board for 2024 NFL draft »\n• What's real in international soccer »\n More ESPN+ content »\nAll of those hardships considerably cooled any hype around Barber's title aspirations. In the time since, however, Barber has found her stride. She has won five in a row, including an impressive showing against Amanda Ribas in June, despite being a significant underdog. -- Okamoto\nOne Championship lightweight and welterweight\n2019 Rank: 22\nRecord since 2019: 4-1\nIt's easy for fans in the United States to overlook the Singapore-based One Championship, which only recently began airing its fights on American TV. But Lee's accomplishments are attention-grabbing. At the time of our 2019 ranking, Lee had just knocked out the veteran star Shinya Aoki to win the One lightweight championship. Since then, he has lost the title and won it back. And last November, Lee added the welterweight title as well. Christian and his atomweight sister, Angela, are the only siblings in MMA to reign as champs. -- Wagenheim\nOne Championship women's atomweight champion\n2019 Rank: 14\nRecord since 2019: 1-1\nLife outside the cage has been extremely hard for Lee. Her sister Victoria, also a fighter for One Championship, committed suicide last December. Lee has not fought since October 2022 and might never fight again, but what she has done cannot be overstated. She won the One women's 115-pound title at 19, making her the youngest major MMA champion ever. Lee defended that title five times and was never defeated for it. She's been one of the main faces for One for nearly a decade and yet is only 27 years old. If she does step away, she should be proud of everything she was able to accomplish. --Raimondi\nUFC men's bantamweight\n2019 Rank: 16\nRecord since 2019: 5-1\nRepresenting the country of Wales, Shore is the region's best hope at the moment to claim a UFC championship. Shore, 28, had a big opportunity to thrust himself into title conversation when he fought Ricky Simon in July 2022 but came up short in a submission loss. That result was disappointing, but Simon is a dark horse at 145 -- in other words, a loss to Simon doesn't mean Shore isn't capable of making a run in this division. Shore is skilled and quietly 6-1 in the UFC. He will get some high-profile chances in 2024, and if he makes the most of them, he'll make more noise in the UFC's standings than most. -- Okamoto\nUFC lightweight\n2019 Rank: 4 (tied with Aspen Ladd)\nRecord since 2019: 4-3\nHaqparast was 11-2 and four fights into his UFC career at the time of our 2019 ranking. He had a rough go of it for a while, dropping three of his next five bouts and pulling out of a couple because of injuries. But now the German-born lightweight has won two in a row and is again headed in the right direction. -- Wagenheim\nUFC middleweight\n2019 Rank: 3\nRecord since 2019: 1-4\nShahbazyan won his first four UFC fights dominantly in 2018 and 2019, the last three via finish. He looked like a potential future UFC middleweight champion. Then the competition got steeper and some of the holes in Shahbazyan's game were exposed, namely cardio and defensive wrestling. Since the hot start, he has lost four of five. Shahbazyan is still just 25 years old and recently changed camps to Xtreme Couture. There is still hope for him. -- Raimondi\nUFC lightweight\n2019 Rank: 20\nRecord since 2019: 5-3\nIt doesn't feel like Moises is only 28 years old, and that's because of the level of competition that he has faced. He has been thrown to the absolute wolves during his time in the UFC. The obvious names he's fought include Islam Makhachev and Beneil Dariush -- and if the list stopped there, you'd already say he's had tough matchmaking in the UFC. But then you add Damir Ismagulov, Joel Alvarez and Benoit Saint-Denis. Some of these names are less well-known, but these are established fighters with records or high-ceiling guys with great talent. And that's not even to mention some of the veterans he's gone up against in Bobby Green and Michael Johnson. If Moises has been \"disappointing,\" it's only fair to consider who he's fought. Don't be surprised if he suddenly finds his stride and starts stringing together wins. Despite the up-and-down record, he has talent. -- Okamoto\nPFL women's featherweight\n2019 Rank: 4 (tied with Nasrat Haqparast)\nRecord since 2019: 2-3\nWhen our 2019 rankings were being compiled, Ladd had just suffered her first career loss. But it had come to a former UFC champion, Germaine de Randamie, so Ladd's stock did not immediately plummet. However, Ladd then lost two of three bantamweight bouts in the UFC and had fights canceled because of injury, illness and weigh-in problems. She was released by the UFC, picked up by the PFL before this season and missed the playoffs. -- Wagenheim\nGillian Robertson gets back in the win column with a submission win over Priscila Cachoeira at UFC 269.\nUFC strawweight\n2019 Rank: 12\nRecord since 2019: 5-4\nUFC light heavyweight\n2019 Rank: 11\nRecord since 2019: 5-3\nBellator featherweight\n2019 Rank: 9\nRecord since 2019: 2-1\nUFC light heavyweight\n2019 Rank: 7\nRecord since 2019: 2-3-1\nUFC featherweight\n2019 Rank: 10\nRecord since 2019: 2-3\nUFC women's flyweight\n2019 Rank: 17\nRecord since 2019: 2-3-1\nLFA women's flyweight champion\n2019 Rank: 23\nRecord since 2019: 3-3\nBellator featherweight\n2019 Rank: 18\nRecord since 2019: 2-5\nONE lightweight\n2019 Rank: 24\nRecord since 2019: 1-0\nBrave CF welterweight\n2019 Rank: 15\nRecord since 2019: 0-2"}
{"title": "Can the Pelicans count on Zion in 2023-24?", "date": "", "text": "Jay Williams shares some thoughts from inside the Pelicans organization about Zion Williamson's work ethic. (1:34)\nNEW ORLEANS -- With a once-promising season lost, Zion Williamson sat at the end of the New Orleans Pelicans' bench.\nAs his teammates and coaches slowly shuffled into the tunnel following the play-in tournament loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, Williamson, clad in all black, quietly remained in his seat, staring down at the floor as disappointment filled the air in the Smoothie King Center.\nThe Pelicans' 2022-23 season was over, and it ended as every season of Williamson's short NBA career has -- with the 2019 No. 1 pick in street clothes watching, unable to help as his team was eliminated.\nThe Pelicans had been in first place in the Western Conference in December and looked like a team that could make a splash in the playoffs. Now they wouldn't even get that far. A team that tumbled down the standings in January couldn't hold off the Thunder in a do-or-die game in mid-April, removing any chance of a possible Williamson comeback in a first-round playoff series.\nWhether that comeback would have even happened became a confusing ordeal. The day before the play-in game, Williamson declared himself physically fine but added that he wasn't going to play until \"I feel like Zion\" again. Two days later, Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin said Williamson misspoke and he had yet to be cleared for 5-on-5 play.\nBoth the lack of availability and the lack of clarity around his health have become an all-too-familiar occurrence during Williamson's young NBA career.\nIn four seasons, he's played in just 114 of a possible 317 games (308 regular-season games, three play-in games and a six-game playoff series in 2022) for New Orleans, none in the postseason. His injury-driven absences have regularly extended far beyond the time frames the team has initially given for potential returns.\nIn past offseasons, Williamson has trained largely on his own away from New Orleans. This year, things have been different.\n\"I can tell you Zion Williamson has been in our gym more than he has in his entire career in the offseason,\" Griffin said last week while speaking to the Greater New Orleans Quarterback Club. \"He has been in New Orleans virtually all offseason, which is different.\"\nMultiple sources said Williamson was playing pickup basketball with teammates early in September. Sources also told ESPN that Williamson has been working with trainers to help get his lower body ready for the strenuous 82-game season.\nWhen he's been on the court, Williamson has played like a generational talent, averaging 25.8 points on 60.5% shooting while earning two All-Star nods. The problem is he hasn't been on the court enough. As he begins playing on his five-year, $194 million extension he signed in July 2022, Williamson and the Pelicans are at a crossroads.\nCan he finally be healthy enough to lead the roster to a playoff series victory -- something that has happened just once for the franchise in the past 15 seasons? Or does more disappointment lie ahead?\nON FEB. 8, 2022, the Pelicans dealt for CJ McCollum and Larry Nance Jr. from the Portland Trail Blazers. The idea was to build a big three in New Orleans of Williamson, McCollum and Brandon Ingram. The Pelicans have played 119 games since making the trade. Williamson, Ingram and McCollum have played just 10 games together, sharing the court for 172 minutes.\n\"It was a tough year where your top players don't play over a combined 70 games,\" McCollum said following the loss to the Thunder. \"It's difficult to compete at a high level and sustain a high level when you're missing those players.\"\nIngram missed 29 consecutive games with a toe injury, and McCollum battled through multiple injuries in the latter half of the season, including a torn UCL in his right thumb and a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\nThe bench couldn't get its footing as Nance was hampered by a shoulder injury and Jose Alvarado missed the final two months because of a stress fracture in his right leg.\nBut it was Williamson's right hamstring injury, which kept him out from Jan. 2 through the end of the season, that derailed any momentum the Pelicans had built. They were 23-14 when Williamson suffered the injury, good enough for third in the West at the time. When all was said and done, they were 42-40 and losing to the Thunder in the play-in tournament.\nSunday, Oct. 8\n76ers at Celtics, 6 p.m.\nFriday, Oct. 13\nWarriors at Lakers, 10 p.m. (ESPN2)\nAll times Eastern\nFrustrations mounted inside the locker room and the organization as Williamson's return was delayed. Players, like many, were also waiting for Williamson to return. They understood his importance to their on-court success and were disappointed with the setbacks.\nIt was clear they understood setbacks were a part of the process, but they too wanted to see Williamson get back to his high-flying, dominant ways.\nWilliamson would tantalize fans with pregame dunk routines, then return to his familiar spot on the bench, seemingly no closer to a return to game action -- a return that was hampered by multiple setbacks. Publicly, the team remained supportive of Williamson.\n\"He went up and windmill-dunked pregame. That's not the skill set that makes you capable of playing 5-on-5 basketball,\" Griffin said after the season. \"So for people to now say, 'He chose not to play basketball,' that's nonsense.\"\nStill, Williamson's lack of availability has often extended far beyond what the team has initially projected. Just before the start of his rookie season, Williamson tore his meniscus in his right knee and was supposed to miss six to eight weeks. He didn't make his debut for 13 weeks.\nOn media day before his third season in 2021, Griffin announced Williamson had suffered a fracture in his right foot during the offseason but the team expected him back for the regular season. When asked, Williamson also said he was going to be back for the regular season.\nAfter multiple setbacks, Williamson missed the entire 2021-22 season, missing out on a possible return in the playoffs after the Pelicans made it through the play-in tournament to earn the No. 8 seed.\nIn April 2022, before the end of the season, Williamson's stepfather Lee Anderson told \"The Jordy Culotta Show,\" an online show based in Baton Rouge, that he expected Williamson to return that season. That return continued to be delayed, and Williamson didn't make it back on the floor for the first-round series against the Phoenix Suns.\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Windhorst: Holiday's next move\n• Big preseason questions and predictions\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nLast season, after hurting the hamstring on Jan. 2, Williamson again had multiple setbacks that pushed his timeline further back before ultimately not making it back for the play-in tournament game against the Thunder.\nWhen Williamson has played with McCollum and Ingram, the Pelicans have excelled in their short time together, averaging 120.9 points per 100 possessions and outscoring opponents by 60 points in 172 minutes.\nHowever, neither Ingram nor Williamson has played more than 62 games in a season in their time together in New Orleans.\nDuring Williamson's rookie season, the two played in 22 games together under coach Alvin Gentry and were plus-74 in 408 minutes together. The following season, under Stan Van Gundy, they were just plus-88 in 59 games played for a total of 1,259 minutes. Williamson missed the entire 2021-22 season but in the 12 games they did share the court a year ago, they were +72 in 241 minutes with Willie Green.\n\"I'm sure you guys can look at our team and realize that there was a point in the season that we were really good and it was because for the most part we were a healthy team,\" Green said on April 14. \"And then when we weren't, what did we look like?\"\nKendrick Perkins and Richard Jefferson aren't buying Zion Williamson's latest comments about his diet and getting back on the court.\nWILLIAMSON'S MAX CONTRACT extension, which he signed after missing the entire 2021-22 season, begins this season. However, for a brief moment this summer, it seemed as if it might not begin in New Orleans.\nESPN's Brian Windhorst reported that there was speculation around the league that the Pelicans would trade Williamson in an attempt to move up in the 2023 NBA draft.\nOn a number of occasions, including dating back to his time with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Griffin has said no player on the roster is untouchable. And while Williamson's name was bandied about in rumors, nothing serious was truly discussed with moving him, multiple sources told ESPN.\nWilliamson remained a Pelican but dealt with off-court drama that kept his name in the headlines. After Williamson announced in June he was expecting his first child, multiple other women called him out online, claiming relationships.\n\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nIn his first public appearance following the social media posts, Williamson's Zion Williamson Foundation donated $250,000 to the Jefferson Parish school system. During this appearance, while Williamson didn't say anything on the subject, Anderson did, saying, \"All I'm gonna say this morning is believe half of what you see and nothing you hear. That's all I'm gonna say. I stand by my son 100%.\"\nThere are some around the Pelicans organization that are hoping the embarrassment of the summer will provide extra motivation for the 23-year-old Williamson heading into the new season, multiple sources told ESPN.\nWilliamson's weight, and its effect on his lower-body injuries, is the biggest reason he hasn't been able to stay on the court. Williamson addressed his struggles with eating healthy to stay in game shape on former NBA player Gilbert Arenas' podcast \"Gil's Arena\" during summer league in Las Vegas.\n\"It's hard, man,\" Williamson said. \"I'm 20, 22, have all the money in the world -- well, it feels like all the money in the world. It's hard.\n\"I'm at that point now, because of certain things, I'm putting back the wisdom around me. I don't want to say older because they get defensive, but I'm putting people around me with wisdom. Put me on game to certain things. And just go from there.\"\nGriffin said last week that he believes Williamson is \"doing his part\" to improve.\n\"For us, we have certainly learned over the years what we think works and doesn't work,\" Griffin said last week. \"But a huge part of that is incumbent on him. A huge part of that is, 'Is he willing to do what it takes to be successful?'\"\nThe team has made moves to control what it can, as well. Aaron Nelson, a much-heralded hire when Griffin took over the team's basketball operations in 2019, will not return as the head of the medical staff after being shifted to an advisory role with the performance team. His duties are set to be spread out among a number of staffers while the team searches for a replacement.\n\"I don't know that philosophically we have made radical changes as much as we have addressed specific needs players have had,\" Griffin said last week. \"We have hired a physical therapist in our organization for the first time. It's not something that historically has been part of the model, I suppose. ... We are still trying to respond to player needs and to be attentive to those changes, what they need to be.\"\nStill, Griffin knows that no matter what the Pelicans do, their success hinges on the health of their stars, led by Williamson.\n\"I can't tell you whether or not they will be healthy,\" Griffin said last week. \"I have no ability to read that future. But I can tell you in every area we do control, we are doing everything we can to bring that to fruition. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. But if you can be both, you can be special. We feel like we are putting ourselves in a position for that to happen, both on and off the court. That's exciting to us.\""}
{"title": "The Bucks?! What their shocking Damian Lillard deal means for all sides", "date": "", "text": "Brian Windhorst explains why the Milwaukee Bucks are under tremendous pressure to win an NBA championship to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo. (1:27)\nWow ... what?\nAfter nearly an entire NBA offseason of stasis between the Portland Trail Blazers and Miami Heat, superstar point guard Damian Lillard has been traded to the ... Milwaukee Bucks!?\nThe shocking move -- a three-team deal that also sent guard Jrue Holiday and 2018 No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton to the Trail Blazers and big man Jusuf Nurkic to the Phoenix Suns -- doesn't just dash the hopes of Heat fans, it creates an even more powerful juggernaut in Milwaukee led by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who now has another All-NBA talent by his side.\nDid Milwaukee just become the unquestioned 2023-24 NBA title favorite? Which teams should be calling Portland about a deal for Holiday? Did Phoenix get better around its three stars? Where does Miami go from here?\nOur panel of NBA insiders is breaking down what the biggest trade of the offseason means for all sides.\nJamal Collier: League-altering. This move elevates the Bucks into superteam status, changes the conversation around Antetokounmpo's impending future and sets the table for Lillard, after a decade in the league, to shine on his first true playoff stage with championship expectations.\nBobby Marks: Not risky. On the surface, trading for 33-year-old Lillard and the $200 million left on his contract is a huge gamble, especially considering Lillard has played a total of 87 games in the past two seasons. But when you factor in that the cost to retain Holiday could have reached $223 million on a new contract, the risk is mitigated. Also, if Holiday left next offseason as a free agent, Milwaukee had only the $12.9 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception to replace him.\nTim Bontemps: Stunning. I'm not sure it makes the Bucks much better, but it continues a trend of doing things that (seemingly) are designed to make Antetokounmpo happy. And if this helps him stay in Milwaukee long term, it's an unquestionable win.\nDave McMenamin: Clyde Drexler-esque. After 10-plus years as the Blazers' No. 1 option without reaching the championship mountaintop, Drexler was traded to Houston in 1995 to team up with the game's most impactful big man in Hakeem Olajuwon to help Houston win a second ring (and his first). Nearly three decades later, Lillard could follow the same script with Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee.\nAndré Snellings: An absolute game-changer. The Bucks have been my preseason favorites to win the championship in each of the past three seasons, but after winning in 2021 they have been really impacted by the injuries to All-Star second option Khris Middleton. Giannis is the most dominant player in the NBA and their team defense is tough, but they lacked the volume shooting from distance to be able to properly maximize their potential. Lillard gives them the best shooting-scoring option on the perimeter east of Stephen Curry -- and on paper makes their team appear to be unstoppable in the East.\nRichard Jefferson says the Bucks have become his '\"way-too-early favorite\" with the addition of Damian Lillard.\nCollier: Powerful. His words carry weight. After Antetokounmpo cast doubt on whether he will stay with the franchise long term, the organization responded by pairing him with the best player he has ever called a teammate.\nBontemps: Satisfied. Giannis has talked openly about wanting to see the Bucks fully committed long term. This trade costs the Bucks a key option in Holiday and a ton of tax dollars. Now, let's see whether Antetokounmpo can lead the Bucks back to the promised land.\nSnellings: Elated, like he just got another 50-piece Chick-n-Mini meal after winning Finals MVP. Giannis has been holding the Bucks' feet to the fire to make championship moves, and this is about the biggest move possible. Add in Lillard's ultracompetitive \"Dame Time\" attitude on top of the incredible talent fit and it's hard to imagine what else Giannis might be looking for before committing to an extension. The Bucks have shown they are all-in on helping him win more chips in Milwaukee.\nMcMenamin: Determined. The 2021 Finals MVP is adding a player who last season averaged 32.2 points (a career high) and 7.3 assists and shot 37.1% from 3 to a Bucks group that already had a momentous summer by re-signing Brook Lopez, seeing Bobby Portis gain big-game experience with USA Basketball and allowing more time for Middleton to return to form from his knee injury. Antetokounmpo couldn't have asked for more from the front office.\nMarks: Ready to put pen to paper. We wrote about how Giannis likely not signing a three-year, $169 million extension before Oct. 23 was a business decision. Especially with the uncertainty of Holiday entering the last year of his contract. Does that change with the addition of Lillard? Tacking on an extra three seasons would align Antetokounmpo's contract with that of his new star guard.\nCollier: Fact. Losing Holiday hurts, but the Bucks have what they have been missing the past few seasons, a bona fide perimeter star who can pressure a defense off the dribble and score from the outside. Lillard will help Milwaukee avoid its most stagnant offensive tendencies. And if Lillard and Antetokounmpo can get on the same page in the pick-and-roll, there is no better combo in the league.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Windhorst: Holiday's next move\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Players react to trade on social media\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nMarks: Fiction. I am not ready to crown Milwaukee the favorite even with the addition of Lillard. There are questions with their depth, especially at point guard. And losing a shooter in Grayson Allen hurts. And which Middleton is Milwaukee going to get this season: the All-Star from 2020-21 or the one who averaged 15.3 points in 2022-23?\nMcMenamin: Fiction. I'm not so sure the Bucks moved their championship meter any more than Phoenix did in this very trade by adding depth and another capable big in Nurkic, while parting with only one rotation piece in Ayton.\nBontemps: Fiction. How much of an upgrade is Lillard from Holiday? He's obviously a tremendous player, but I'm not sure he's a better fit for the Bucks. And there's still Boston and Denver, among others, to worry about.\nSnellings: Fact. I had them as the slight favorites pre-trade, in a close battle with a handful of other teams, including the defending champion Nuggets and new-look Celtics. With this move, health- and chemistry-dependent, the Bucks have by far the best team in the NBA on paper, with potentially the most difficult to guard duo since Shaq and Kobe -- plus a raft of other talented players who know their roles.\nMarks: Philadelphia. The 76ers can sit in a holding pattern and wait until the 2024 offseason when they can sign Holiday outright with cap space, but considering that the goal is to win right now, Philly should be drawing up Holiday trade options. The challenge comes with the reluctance of Philadelphia parting ways with guard Tyrese Maxey and the lack of appetite of Portland to take back James Harden. As with Wednesday's Lillard blockbuster, the 76ers might need to rope in a third team to facilitate a Holiday trade.\nBontemps: About half the league, including Miami and the LA Clippers. Again, getting Holiday instead of Lillard would not be a bad Plan B. What's certain is Holiday is going to be changing teams again at some point in the next few months. The only question is when.\nCollier: Miami could rebound nicely by acquiring Holiday, although Jimmy Butler might need to apologize for the way he treated him during their playoff series in the first round last season. Another team who could really use a player like Holiday: the Chicago Bulls, who have been searching for a way to fill their point guard void with Lonzo Ball injured.\nMcMenamin: Miami. Holiday's defensive-first mentality and noted professionalism will be a natural fit with the vaunted Heat Culture. If the Blazers and Heat can push aside any static built up between them from the Lillard negotiations that ultimately went nowhere, they might just find that there's another point guard trade on the table.\nSnellings: The Celtics should be either talking or on hold with the Trail Blazers. Boston has been a true point guard away from championship contention for the past two seasons, and it created a perimeter defense hole by trading Marcus Smart this summer. Holiday would fill both needs perfectly, running the team on offense and helping Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis form into the potent offensive force they have the ability to become.\nMarks: I already had them as the second-best team, behind Denver, before the trade. I am not ready to insult the defending champions, but the additions of Allen and Nassir Little balance out a bench that was littered with players signed to the veteran minimum. The question for Phoenix is whether Allen is there long term, especially with Eric Gordon on the roster. Allen is in the last year of this contract and will be a free agent next offseason.\nBontemps: In the top four, probably. I'm not sure this deal helps Phoenix much, either. The Suns do get some depth options with cheaper deals, but none of this really moves the needle for me from a championship-contention standpoint. Other than Nurkic, if any of these guys is playing key minutes deep in the playoffs, it'll be an issue, and Nurkic is a downgrade from Ayton.\nMcMenamin: Clearly Bontemps and I disagree on this one. The added depth from the trade will help coach Frank Vogel navigate the 82-game grind with some urgency, knowing he has backups to go to, rather than feeling the need to swaddle his stars in Bubble Wrap. Phoenix should be vying for No. 1 in West.\nCollier: Top two. Denver is going to be right there with Phoenix at the top of the standings, but the Suns did well this offseason building a team around their superstars. Even if one of their stars has to miss time, the Suns have enough supporting cast and balance to make up for an absence from one of their top three players.\nSnellings: With the added depth, the Suns will finish much higher in the West than they would have before. I was very concerned about the age and injury history of their three best players, all perimeter volume scorers, and the lack of defense, size and depth behind them. For what they need, Nurkic might be an upgrade on what Ayton could have given them inside, and the impact of the quality depth on the perimeter can't be overstated. I still have the Nuggets as the favorites out West, but now would put the Suns on the level with the Lakers and Warriors as contenders, just ahead of the Kings and Grizzlies.\nStephen A. Smith considers the Bucks a perfect fit for Damian Lillard but says Milwaukee isn't where he wanted to be traded to.\nMarks: One. It takes two to tango when making a trade. Portland simply felt Miami did not have the players or draft picks to make a deal.\nBontemps: Three. Sure, the Heat would like to have Lillard, but they always expect another player to become available. By this time next year, several more might hit the trade or free agent markets. Miami didn't need to rush into any deal.\nMcMenamin: Five. Butler's immediate Instagram response calling for the league to investigate Milwaukee for tampering -- in jest or not -- suggests the Heat had better not just stand pat. Miami has work to do to improve despite last season's surprise Finals run.\nCollier: Nine. Miami never seemed to have a deal that truly got Portland excited, but when a superstar player asks for a trade and makes it known that your franchise is his preferred destination, it stings when you don't land him. The Heat have to find a way to pivot if they want to keep up with the other contenders in the East.\nSnellings: 10, if it were actually possible for them to make a deal that satisfied the Trail Blazers. The Heat have been one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference, with multiple Finals appearances in recent years. But Butler turned 34 this month, and Miami already lacked the talent of the other top contenders. With the Bucks and Celtics both making major moves and several teams also gearing up in the West, it is hard to see the Heat with a legitimate chance to win a title in the Butler era after missing out on Dame."}
{"title": "Revisiting the greatest upset in SEC history: When Mississippi State stunned Bear Bryant and Bama", "date": "", "text": "TYRONE KEYS AND Johnie Cooks were the last players out of the Mississippi State locker room on the afternoon of Nov. 1, 1980.\nThe game had been over for nearly an hour, and the stands at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi, were still packed with delirious Bulldogs fans celebrating Mississippi State's epic 6-3 win over Alabama, widely considered to this day to be the greatest win in Mississippi State history and one of the biggest upsets in SEC history.\nCrimson Tide coach Bear Bryant had assembled one of the most formidable winning machines ever in the SEC. Alabama had not lost a conference game since the first week of October 1978, winning 28 straight games overall and 27 straight in the league. The No. 1 Tide were vying for their third straight national championship and were a 20-point favorite over an extremely talented Mississippi State team that featured multiple players who would go on to have long NFL careers.\n\"Johnie and I walked out of the locker room, didn't really say anything and just bumped fists,\" Keys recalled. \"Coach Bryant recruited me and Johnie, and I remember on signing day we were calling each other and making sure we were still both going to Mississippi State to try to build something there instead of going out of state.\n\"We had some great times together, all the guys on that team, but that game alone made it all worth it.\"\nThe echoes from that game endure, and when Alabama and Mississippi State square off Saturday at Davis Wade Stadium (9 p.m. ET, ESPN), it will mark the end of a 76-year streak in which the schools have met. They are separated by an 84-mile drive along Highway 82, which is the shortest distance between any schools in the SEC. But with Oklahoma and Texas joining the conference in 2024 and divisions being eliminated, the league office had to adjust the schedule, meaning Alabama and Mississippi State won't meet in the regular season for the first time since 1947.\nIt's a series Alabama has dominated, as Mississippi State has won just 10 times going back to the 1948 season. But the win in 1980 will forever resonate with Mississippi State fans and the players on that team. And, yes, it still gnaws at the Alabama players, who all these years later are less than thrilled any time the game is revisited -- even those who had long pro careers.\n\"Oh gosh was it tough ... really, really tough,\" said Alabama linebacker and co-captain Randy Scott, who went on to play seven seasons with the Green Bay Packers.\n\"I remember Coach Bryant motivating us at halftime as only he could,\" he said. \"We'd won so many games, and even at the end of that one, knew we were going to find a way to win it. But we didn't, and it affects you. There were so many expectations on an Alabama football player, to win every time you go out. That's why I went there, and it hurts when you don't. It still does.\"\nSCOTT AND FELLOW co-captain Major Ogilvie had never lost to an SEC opponent in their Alabama careers until that game. They were 44-4 overall.\n\"We knew what we were up against,\" Keys said. \"Those guys just didn't lose, to anybody. But we had a belief that it was our time. It came down right to the end, and we kept telling each other that somebody had to make a play.\"\nThat somebody was Keys, who grew up about three miles from the stadium and used to watch games there through a fence as a youngster. Mississippi State played its bigger games back then in Jackson, not Starkville.\n\"Southern Miss had embarrassed us three weeks earlier at home, and we had a players-only meeting and said we weren't going to lose again,\" Keys said. \"The reporters all reminded us that we still had Alabama on the schedule, and we said that it didn't matter.\"\nThe Bulldogs also had their \"secret weapon\" on defense. Head coach Emory Bellard took over the defense that week. Alabama was running the wishbone offense, and Bellard was the father of the wishbone after implementing it at Texas in the late 1960s as an assistant. Bellard even tutored Bryant on the finer points of the wishbone before Alabama adopted it in the early 1970s.\n\"We have the horses to annihilate this offense, and I know what I'm talking about because I invented the wishbone,\" Bellard told his defensive players, who held the nation's highest-scoring team without a touchdown and to just 180 total yards.\nAlabama hadn't done anything on offense all day, and the sellout crowd of 50,891 -- the largest ever to see a sporting event in the state of Mississippi at the time -- had worked itself into a frenzy. But after Scott blocked a Mississippi State field goal attempt, Alabama still had life. The Tide drove to the Mississippi State 3-yard line in the final seconds thanks to the passing of quarterback Don Jacobs, including a third-and-21 completion to Ogilvie.\nThere was no SEC rule in those days against artificial noisemakers, and the clanging Mississippi State cowbells were deafening. Officials did, however, have the discretion to stop the clock if they deemed it was too loud for the offense to hear. Jacobs briefly stepped from under center and motioned he couldn't hear, but the clock continued to tick.\nJacobs faked to the fullback and started an option play to the right. Keys shot through from his position at left end to hit Jacobs and knock the ball loose. Mississippi State's Billy Jackson pounced on it with six seconds remaining.\nJacobs, a longtime coach at both the college and high school level, owned his miscue then and still does 40-plus years later. He's probably been unfairly judged over the years because he left the game earlier with an injury, wasn't 100 percent but returned anyway. Plus, his passing is what got the Tide in position to win the game in the first place.\n\"It was one play in a four-year career, and I know I'll always be remembered for it,\" Jacobs said. \"They had the right call at the right time, and [Keys] made the right play. You watch the film, and if I had handed it off to our fullback, we win the ball game and you move on with life.\"\nJacobs said he still catches flak for that play and joked that it's part of life when you play quarterback at Alabama.\n\"Have you listened to the Alabama fans right now? They've lost one game and are trying to fire the quarterback and the offensive line left and right,\" Jacobs said with a laugh. \"You can't allow one moment to define you, and I didn't. I hated it for our team and hated it for our teammates, particularly our defense. They played their tails off, didn't give up a touchdown and we lost the game.\"\nBryant's mantra of never being a quitter is part of SEC football lore, and Alabama didn't quit even after Keys' game-saving play. All the Bulldogs had to do was kneel on the ball, albeit from their own 2-yard line. Some of the Mississippi State players had already started to hoist Bellard on their shoulders. Quarterback John Bond stepped up under his center, Kent Hull, and called for the snap. But Scott moved right over the top of Hull's helmet and had other ideas.\nScott was able to tap the ball just as Hull snapped it, getting enough of the ball that it sailed right past Bond's helmet.\n\"It wasn't planned. I had seen it in high school,\" Scott said. \"I slid my nose guard over and stepped right in the gap. I just told myself, 'I'm going to try it,' anything not to lose that game.\"\nBond was panicking. All he knew was there was a huge pileup and that he didn't have the ball.\n\"Who's got the ball? Kent, you got the ball?\" Bond screamed to Hull, who went on to play on the Buffalo Bills teams that went to four consecutive Super Bowls.\nAt the bottom of the scrum, Mississippi State fullback Donald Ray King was clinging to the ball. And even if the play may not have been legal, Bond admires Scott's willingness to do whatever it took to win that game.\n\"Hey, he was trying to win a football game. I don't blame him,\" Bond said. \"I would have been pissed at my teammates if they didn't try it.\"\nRick Cleveland, a Mississippi Hall of Fame sportswriter who was covering the game that day for the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, remembers the umpire throwing a flag on the play, but the whole ending of the game was chaotic. The officials immediately raced to the exit, which fortunately for them, was on the Mississippi State side of the field.\nThe euphoria of winning the game for the Bulldogs was topped only by what happened afterward, when the legendary Bryant visited the Mississippi State locker room to congratulate the players.\nBond said the players were spraying Cokes on each other, high-fiving and soaking up the monumental victory.\nAll of a sudden, he said, a wave of quiet spread across the locker room. Bond looked up, and Bryant was standing there with a state trooper beside him.\n\"You could hear a pin drop. The players took a knee,\" Bond said, \"I mean, it was Bear Bryant, a legend, in our locker room right after we'd beaten them.\"\nCleveland, in his second season as a Mississippi State beat writer, was in the locker room interviewing players and vividly remembers the shock of seeing Bryant.\n\"He was already feeble, and the highway patrolman helped him up onto a folding chair,\" Cleveland said. \"He didn't say a lot, other than to tell the State players, 'Don't let anybody tell you this was an upset. You whipped us. You were the better football team and deserved to win.'\"\nKeys still gets chills when he thinks about Bryant's visit.\n\"All those fans were cursing him and yelling at him, and he made it a point to come all the way across to our locker room,\" said Keys, a member of the Chicago Bears' 1985 Super Bowl championship team. \"It's the greatest act of sportsmanship I've ever witnessed in my life.\"\nSylvester Croom was an assistant coach on that Alabama team and played under Bryant at the school. He didn't know at the time that his coach visited the Mississippi State locker room, but wasn't surprised when he heard.\n\"That's what made Coach Bryant unique,\" Croom said. \"He was as tough as nails mentally and physically, but he was a loving-hearted man who had a tremendous respect for the game and people.\"\nBryant's health was failing at that point -- he would die after a massive heart attack a little more than a month after he retired from coaching two years later -- and Alabama was never as dominant on his watch after that loss. The Crimson Tide lost two weeks later to Notre Dame, were upset by an eventual 1-10 Georgia Tech team in Week 2 of 1981 (although Alabama tied for the SEC title that year), then lost four games in Bryant's final season in 1982, including the last three games of the regular season.\nIn the summer leading up to the 1980 season, Ogilvie said Bryant missed a week of two-a-day practices.\n\"We really didn't know what it was, just that it was health problems, and it wasn't his nature to discuss things like that with us,\" Ogilvie said. \"Coach Bryant was one of those people you just couldn't imagine life without him.\"\nFor Mississippi State defensive tackle Glen Collins, the game itself was a blur. Collins played a great game, and Ogilvie said the Bulldogs' tackles were the key to shutting down the Tide's wishbone.\nThe morning before the game, Collins' fiancée was murdered in Jackson. Collins didn't find out until later in the day.\n\"It's so bittersweet when I think about it now,\" said Collins, who was a first-round draft pick in 1982 by the Cincinnati Bengals. \"I remember my aunt calling me in the room and telling me what happened. It was devastating. They all told me it was my decision if I wanted to play. I never thought about not playing. I knew she would have not wanted me not to play.\"\nTHE TALES OF what happened after that game have become as legendary as what transpired on the field, one of those transcendent sporting events where thousands claim to have been in attendance even if they weren't.\n\"I can't tell you how many people have come up to me over the years and told me they were at the game,\" Keys said. \"Even the doctor who delivered my daughter's baby talked about it for an hour. He said, 'I was in the band that day and will never forget it.'\"\nBellard told Cleveland that he was awakened at his house about 3 o'clock in the morning by a bunch of fans celebrating right outside his window. Asked if he joined them, Bellard told Cleveland, \"You better believe it, pardner.\"\nBond, a highly recruited freshman, was the admitted free spirit on the team and showed up on campus driving a new Corvette and sporting long flowing hair.\n\"Damn, Kent, we're going to beat these people's ass,\" Bond told his center that week.\nBond backed up his confidence by having one of the team managers drive his Corvette to Jackson and park it behind the locker room at the stadium.\n\"And have it full of Budweiser,\" Bond instructed him.\nBond had already gone a round or two outside a bar the Thursday before the game, when he got into a scrape and punched somebody. His hand was bloodied, and he made a late-night visit to see the trainer at his home.\n\"He told me I needed stitches,\" Bond said. \"I said, 'I can't play with stitches,' so he taped it up and I bled all over Kent's ass the whole game. Everybody thought he's the one who had gotten hurt, but it was me.\"\nThe Bulldogs finished 5-1 in the SEC that season, which remains the best league record they've had since 1980.\n\"We were a couple bounces away from being in the national title picture that year,\" Bond said.\nKeys' postgame escapades were a bit more tame. And as he grows older, especially over the last few months, he's thought about that game often, precipitated in large part by Cooks' death in July. Cooks, one of the greatest players ever at Mississippi State, had 20 tackles that day against the Tide.\n\"I remember him going his way and me going my way after we came out of the locker room,\" said Keys, who hung around to sign autographs and take pictures with fans.\nKeys' parents had already left the stadium, and he soon realized the team bus had too. So he started to walk home. A fan stopped to give him a ride and dropped him off at the house of his high school defensive line coach, Odell Jenkins, who had been a close mentor to Keys. Jenkins died in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKeys said he will never forget the warm smile on Jenkins' face or what Keys' first words were as he walked in the door.\n\"Coach, we did it. I told you we were going to get them.\""}
{"title": "The untold story of CFB's ultimate party crasher", "date": "", "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- It has been nearly 25 years, but J.R. Greene still has the faded orange top hat sitting in his office, the same one he frantically clutched on his head as he led Tennessee's football team onto the field for the national championship Fiesta Bowl game against Florida State, a magical night for the Volunteers and their fans.\nThe top hat was just part of his attire. A 24-year-old student working on his MBA at the time, Greene was also sporting an orange-and-white tuxedo with matching orange gloves and a Power T cummerbund.\nThe ultimate party crasher in the ultimate moment for his beloved Vols, Greene was the \"Big Orange Tux Guy,\" a phrase he repeated over and over to finagle his way onto the stage to sing \"Rocky Top\" with a band playing before the game, onto the ESPN \"College GameDay\" set -- and most improbably -- onto the field in one of those Ferris Bueller-like odysseys that almost sounds like a fairy tale.\nYet there he was, praying every few minutes that he \"wasn't going to end up in jail and miss the biggest game of my life,\" as he raced from the Sun Devil Stadium tunnel with coach Phillip Fulmer, Tee Martin, Al Wilson, Peerless Price and the entire Tennessee contingent in tow.\n\"It's no fairy tale. He was there. Wasn't supposed to be, but he was there,\" Fulmer joked. \"I'm still not sure how he pulled it off.\"\nNobody is -- not even Greene, who figured the timing was right to tell his mind-boggling story publicly for the first time. This is the 25th anniversary of Tennessee's 1998 national championship season, and the team will be honored Saturday at Neyland Stadium during the game against South Carolina.\nAnd, yes, Greene -- a donor and lifelong fan -- plans to be in attendance. He has had season tickets in his family going back to his great-grandfather, John T. O'Connor, who was the mayor of Knoxville in the 1930s. Greene sold programs at Tennessee sporting events as a middle school student in the 1980s.\nRecently, Greene dug out his old tux from the closet, but he wouldn't dare break it back out to wear this weekend.\n\"Oh no, I'm 1-0, unbeaten,\" Greene said. \"I only wear the tux for championship games.\"\nGREENE HAD HIS tux on bright and early 25 years ago, starting that Jan. 4, 1999, morning in the lobby of his hotel. He was ready to show it off, have some fun and send a message. But never in his wildest dreams did Greene envision that several hours later, he would be leading the Tennessee team out onto the field.\n\"Everything sort of perfectly fell into place, and every time somebody asked me who I was or what I was doing, I would just say, 'I'm J.R. Greene, the Big Orange Tux Guy. I'm here to show Tennessee has class,'\" Greene recounted. \"That's all it was about.\"\nAt least, that's the way it started.\nLike many Tennessee fans, Greene was ruffled over comments made by ESPN's Chris Fowler a year earlier. In referencing the nasty backlash and threats directed at him by some Tennessee fans over Peyton Manning not winning the Heisman Trophy, Fowler used the term \"trailer park frenzy,\" something he has apologized for several times. Fowler actually voted for Manning in the Heisman balloting that year.\nIronically, Greene said, Fowler played a crucial role in his getting onto the field that evening in Tempe, Arizona. Greene managed to maneuver his way onto the \"GameDay\" set by climbing up the back stairs from the field. He had bumped into ESPN's Kirk Herbstreit the night before in Scottsdale and told Herbstreit he was going to wear an orange-and-white tux to the game.\n\"He told me if I showed up in an orange-and-white tux that he'd get me on 'GameDay,'\" Greene recalled.\nCrawford Wagner, one of Greene's friends who made the trip to the Fiesta Bowl, remembers that conversation. Now, Wagner had no idea Greene would be successful in making his way to the ESPN set, but looking back, he's not surprised.\n\"J.R. has always been a guy that could sell things and would usually end up in places you didn't necessarily expect to see him,\" Wagner said.\nGreene's penchant for showing up in such places went to another level after his Fiesta Bowl escapades. Later in 1999, he told his story to screeners for \"The Price is Right\" and made it on stage as a contestant on the Bob Barker-hosted game show. In 2001, after taking a job in Los Angeles, he introduced himself to actor Hugh Grant while at the Beverly Hilton and followed him into the green room at the Golden Globe Awards, where he rubbed elbows with Dick Clark, Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.\n\"Let's just say the confidence I gained from being the Big Orange Tux Guy that night changed my future,\" Greene said.\nHerbstreit was in only his third year of doing \"GameDay\" during the 1998 season, and now, after visiting so many venues and encountering so many exuberant fans over the years, he doesn't specifically remember the \"Big Orange Tux Guy.\" Nonetheless, he thinks Greene's zeal is the kind of thing that makes college football unique.\n\"His story adds up because there were back steps to the field, and our set was right in the middle of the Tennessee section,\" Herbstreit said. \"The thing I remember most is that I picked Tennessee, and when Peerless caught that first deep pass, I almost came out of my seat because, especially back in those days, you were married to your picks.\"\nFowler has what he called a vague recollection of Greene and the oddity of his showing up on the set with an orange-and-white tux, which had some custom \"tailoring,\" thanks to Greene's creativity.\nGreene's first attempt to dye a tux orange ended up as more of a peach color. So he bought another tux and colored in the lapels and other areas with an orange magic marker.\n\"That's not real. You're not a real mascot,\" Greene remembers Fowler telling him as the \"GameDay\" host moved in closer and realized the orange was colored in with a marker. \"But if you've got the guts to do that and come up here, why don't you walk down to the field with us?\"\nGreene, nervously looking around to see whether any security guards might be zeroing in on him, went bopping along behind the ESPN duo down the steps.\n\"I remember we had a big net around us, and there were thousands of whiskey bottles on top when we were done with the show,\" Fowler said. \"The Tennessee fans were so hyped to be in that game. But [Greene] looked the part, so I can see why nobody would stop him.\n\"Hey, if I helped him get down on the field in some way, I'm pleased, especially if he was going to make that kind of commitment. Somewhere, that fits into a chaotic cap to what was a chaotic season.\n\"Why not have a guy who's not supposed to be there running around on the field?\"\nGREENE HAD ALREADY morphed into a celebrity of sorts earlier in the day as a sea of charged-up Tennessee fans tailgated outside the stadium. It had been nearly 50 years since the Vols had last won a national championship, going all the way back to the days of legendary coach Gen. Robert Neyland.\n\"You could feel the energy and the anticipation. It was like the whole state of Tennessee was there,\" Greene said.\nGreene flew to the game with buddies Robbie Pope and Mark Sykes. He was initially going to wear the tux on the plane, but Pope convinced him that would be bad luck. Instead, Pope talked Greene into getting up onto a stage during pregame festivities and singing with the band.\n\"J.R. said something about getting up there and singing 'Rocky Top' and was going to chicken out,\" Pope said.\nThe next thing Pope knew, ever-persistent Greene was at the corner of the stage trying to get the drummer's attention. A hulking security guard wearing all black asked Greene who he was, and Greene told him he was there to sing \"Rocky Top.\" The guard told Greene he needed to talk to the drummer, who was right in the middle of a song. Finally, the drummer angrily motioned for Greene to wait, and after the song, the drummer gathered the band together and put a headset on Greene.\nLooking out into the crowd and seeing all the orange, Greene bellowed, \"Who's going to win the national championship?\"\nAnd right on cue, the band broke into a rendition of \"Rocky Top.\" The only problem was Greene froze and forgot the words.\n\"All I knew was the chorus,\" he said bashfully. \"Thankfully, the band bailed me out and started singing. One of the guys started playing the fiddle.\"\nJust as Greene started to belt out \"Rocky Top, you'll always be home sweet home to me,\" he pointed to two girls from the audience to join him on stage, and they linked arms for a little country dancing twirl.\nOut in the crowd, his friends could only wonder what might happen next.\n\"We were probably 100 feet away from the stage, and vintage J.R., when he forgot the words, he ad-libbed and ran with it, which he's good at,\" Wagner said.\nPope said when Greene hopped off the stage, everybody thought he was a celebrity and swarmed him for pictures, and that's when the legend of the \"Big Orange Tux Guy\" really ignited.\n\"I didn't want it to end. The rush was incredible,\" Greene said.\nIN THOSE DAYS, there were no digital tickets, just paper tickets that were torn at the gate as you entered the stadium. Greene, who by now was separated from his friends, didn't want his ticket to be torn and started looking around for another way to get into the game. (Greene still has the ticket intact and was able to get the Voice of the Vols, radio broadcaster John Ward, to sign it.)\nGreene walked around the outside of the stadium, scouting out different entrances. He noticed bowl officials, media and other team personnel going through a special entrance lined with velvet ropes.\nSurely, he thought to himself as his confidence was bubbling, somebody wearing an orange-and-white tuxedo and top hat would look official enough to enter there.\n\"I thought, 'Why not?'\" he said. \"Even then, I wasn't thinking about getting onto the field. I just wanted to get into the game without my ticket being torn.\n\"I had no pass, no credentials, no nothing.\"\nKeep in mind this was pre-9/11, and security measures weren't nearly as stringent as they are today. Greene strolled right through the participants entrance smiling and nodding at the security personnel the whole way. Within minutes, he found himself in the bowels of Sun Devil Stadium, just off the field. One of the first people he saw was Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who took a cursory glance at him and kept walking.\n\"I'm sort of shaking at this point, pinching myself. I mean, I'm walking out onto the field where Tennessee's getting ready to play for the national championship,\" Greene said.\nThen he noticed the back stairway to the \"GameDay\" location. He thought about it (for about two seconds), then climbed up awkwardly and pushed open a little wooden door to the back of the set.\n\"Herbstreit sees me and buries his brow into his arm as if to say, 'He really wore an orange-and-white tux,'\" Greene said. \"I kept waiting for somebody to come kick me out and they never did.\"\nAnything but bashful, Greene approached Herbstreit and Fowler. To this day, he is grateful they were his escorts back onto the field and eventually to the most exhilarating run of his life.\n\"I know Chris Fowler had become the enemy of Tennessee fans, but had he not invited me to go back down to the field with them, there wouldn't be any 'Big Orange Tux Guy' story,\" Greene said. \"I've got nothing bad to say about him.\"\nOnce they all got down to the field, kickoff was fast approaching, and Fowler and Herbstreit went about their business. Greene, his heart pounding, saw a member of the Tennessee dance team he knew and hugged her. By then, he was near the front of the Tennessee tunnel to the locker room, where the cheerleaders, mascots and other members of the Vols' spirit squad were gathering.\nNobody knew who he was or what he was doing there.\nAdam DeVault, who wore the Davy Crockett outfit and carried the giant orange \"T\" flag onto the field, remembers seeing Greene out of the corner of his eye.\n\"That's the only reason I remember,\" DeVault said. \"It was such a big game with so much going on. Nothing is normal about a game like that, really. I guess I assumed he was a donor that had paid a lot of money to run out with the team. I do know I would have been mad had he run out in front of me.\"\nAs the minutes counted down to the Tennessee players filling the tunnel, Greene felt a tap on his shoulder.\n\"Hey, we're already at the NCAA limit for mascots,\" Greene remembers someone from Tennessee telling him.\nTo this day, Greene doesn't know who it was.\n\"I just know that I was sure then that it was over, that I was going to jail,\" he said.\nBarry Garner was in charge of the Tennessee spirit squad that day, filling in for regular coordinator Joy Postell-Gee, who missed the trip at the last minute because she was close to giving birth. (\"I hate to say it, but it would have been a different outcome for [Greene] if I had been there,\" Postell-Gee said. \"He would have never made it onto the field.\")\nThe scene was chaotic, including the opposing players jawing at each other in the locker room area as they neared the tunnel. Garner said he might have alerted authorities if Greene had appeared any earlier.\n\"This is literally minutes before we ran out. We're waiting on Coach Fulmer and watching for him, and then you look to your side and this guy with an orange tuxedo is just standing there,\" Garner recalled.\n\"I said something like, \"Who are you? What are you here for?\"\nGreene's response was a familiar one: \"I'm the Big Orange Tux Guy.\"\nGarner looked at him quizzically and asked, \"Wait, are you supposed to lead us onto the field or something?\"\nForgetting for a few seconds his Eagle Scout vow to always tell the truth, Greene nervously nodded his head yes, to which Garner responded, \"Well, let's go, lead us to a national championship.\"\nGreene, of course, was oblivious to the team's routine for running onto the field, which included Fulmer pointing and saying \"Go,\" and then Smokey, the Vols' bluetick coonhound mascot, being led out first, followed by Davy Crockett (DeVault) carrying the team flag, the costumed version of Smokey, the cheerleaders and then the team. But at least Greene knew to stay to the right.\nOne of Smokey's handlers warned Greene right before they ran out that Smokey liked to zigzag and that if Greene got tripped up and fell, he would be trampled by the players because they wouldn't stop.\nWillis Jepson, who was the lead handler for Smokey that season, laughed when asked about the wild scene.\n\"I was so busy trying to keep Smokey calm because so much was going on that I can't say I remember any of that, but it sure sounds like something we would say,\" Jepson said. \"That's funny, though. We're getting ready to play for a national championship, and we've got some guy running out there with us that nobody knows who he is.\"\nGreene didn't just run. He kept running. As the team turned left toward the sideline, he sprinted out toward midfield by himself before realizing that he needed to make a left turn.\nMeanwhile, nearly an hour had passed since Greene's friends had last seen him. They were already in the stadium. Watching from his seat in the opposite end zone, Blaine Cloud's eyes opened wide as he saw the Tennessee team come racing onto the field.\n\"Coming right toward us was J.R.,\" said Cloud, who was in business school with Greene and whose seats for the game were near Greene's. \"I'd seen him in the tux earlier in the day, but he was moving around all over the place. I didn't know where he was. Knowing J.R., he could have been anywhere, including jail.\"\nBut running out with the team?\n\"We're yelling and screaming. There he was, right next to Smokey,\" Cloud said. \"It's still hard to believe how everything had to align just right for him to be out there.\"\nPope never saw Greene on the field. And when Greene finally got to his seats sometime in the first quarter, Pope didn't believe his buddy's story.\n\"I just told him he was full of s---, but that's what I usually told him about those things,\" Pope said. \"I wasn't inclined to believe him at first blush because I wasn't looking for him on the field. Nobody was. I needed some corroboration, and I guess I didn't really believe it until I saw the video when we got back home.\"\nOne of Greene's friends, Meredith Christenberry, had a camcorder at the game and recorded the Vols' entrance. The video clearly shows Greene making his run for the ages.\nGreene remained on the sideline behind the players and cheerleaders for part of the first quarter. He figured he was living on borrowed time by then. Plus, he said, he couldn't see the game, so he found his way to his seats.\nChristi Meadows Dorsey was a Tennessee cheerleader that season. By the time the game started, word apparently started to spread among bowl officials that there was an unauthorized person on the Vols' sideline.\n\"Somebody came over there, and we all got a little scolding that everybody had to have the right credentials to be on the field,\" she said. \"I didn't notice [Greene] at the time, but it started getting around. It was bizarre. Even all these years later, it's bizarre.\"\nAfter the game, the cheerleaders and spirit squad members were on a bus celebrating Tennessee's 23-16 victory over Florida State when the Big Orange Tux Guy came up in conversation.\n\"We'd just won a national championship, and that's what we were talking about,\" Meadows Dorsey recalled. \"At the same time, we were all trying to figure out who this guy was and where he came from.\"\nThat guy was the Big Orange Tux Guy, the guy with \"class\" and the guy who dared to live on the wild side that historic night for Tennessee football a quarter century ago.\nSome stories grow to the point of becoming myths over time. But not this one.\n\"This isn't a Bigfoot or Sasquatch thing or just a wild rumor,\" DeVault said. \"He was there. I saw him, and there are pictures to prove it.\"\nThe only thing missing is a Big Orange Footprint."}

Watch! »\nSome notable early line movement this week at influential sportsbook Circa Sports, one of the first sportsbooks to post weekly college football lines: The Memphis Tigers went from a 3-point home underdog to a 3-point favorite against Boise State Broncos; The Tulane Green Wave went from a 17-point favorite to as high as a 22.5-point favorite over the UAB Blazers; The No. 7 Washington Huskies went from a 14-point favorite to a 20-point favorite by Thursday, before settling back at -18.5 against the Arizona Wildcats.\nGames that had attracted early lopsided action as of Thursday at DraftKings: 92% of the point-spread money was on the No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs (at Auburn Tigers); 92% of the point-spread money was on the No. 9 Oregon Ducks (at Stanford Cardinal); 83% of the point-spread money was on the No. 6 Penn State Nittany Lions (at Northwestern Wildcats).\nThe total on No. 8 USC Trojans-Colorado Buffaloes was sitting at 73.5 at most sportsbooks Thursday, the highest of any game this season, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nSyracuse Orange +6.5 vs. Clemson Tigers: In terms of total efficiency -- a measure of the play-to-play level performance adjusted for opponent strength and garbage time -- these teams have been nowhere close. Syracuse ranks 15th, Clemson 50th. All that's keeping Clemson's projection afloat here is our preseason prior -- which does still matter -- but not enough. FPI thinks Syracuse at home should be a narrow favorite, a huge difference from the betting line.\nNo. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes to win the national championship (9-1): It wasn't pretty, but the Buckeyes squeaked past Notre Dame last week. And the most important thing was the win. There are other roadblocks before the playoff (vs. Penn State, at Michigan), but FPI believes the Buckeyes are the best team in the country, and that counts for a lot. It makes their chances to win it all 21%.\n\n\nPick games every week and compete for prizes! Make Your Picks\nNo. 8 USC at Colorado OVER 73.5: I priced this total at 77, so there's value in the over. USC is averaging 55 points and has hung at least 42 points in all four matchups this season. Additionally, I thought the Trojans got caught looking ahead to this matchup during last week's tougher-than-expected battle at Arizona State. The primary reason why I believe this total is underpriced is because of Colorado's offensive performance at Oregon last Saturday. However, that Ducks' defense is much better than this USC defense, not to mention the fact that this is a home game and that was a road game for Coach Prime and company. Colorado will score enough to get this over the total.\nGeorgia Southern Eagles -6.5 vs. Coastal Carolina Chanticleers: Clay Helton has done a tremendous job with this Georgia Southern program, as the Eagles are 3-1 straight up and 3-0-1 against the spread while posting a +85 scoring differential for their three non-Wisconsin matchups. On the flip side, Tim Beck's Coastal Carolina squad is a step down from what we've seen from the Chanticleers in recent seasons, as evidenced by last week's 13-point home loss to Georgia State despite closing as a 5-point favorite.\nTCU Horned Frogs -13.5 vs. West Virginia Mountaineers: TCU is undervalued thanks to that stunning 45-42 home loss to Colorado in its season opener. However, the Horned Frogs have very quietly surged back onto the scene thanks to three straight double-digit wins over Nicholls, Houston and SMU. Let's take advantage of the pricing here against a Mountaineers team that is likely headed for a letdown following last Saturday's 20-13 upset win over Texas Tech.\nErin Dolan expects the Broncos to surpass the team points prop bet against a \"terrible\" Bears defense.\n\nAnalysis of all the key injuries to watch will be updated throughout the weekend.\nGet all the latest injury news here.\n\n\nThe second annual ESPN+ exclusive NFL game kicks off the NFL's International Series at Wembley Stadium in London. Stream the game Sunday at 9:30 a.m. ET on ESPN+ Sign up now.\nNew England Patriots QB Mac Jones vs. the Dallas Cowboys' schemed defensive fronts: The Cowboys lead the NFL with a pressure rate of 49.5%. Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn will scheme his defensive alignments, creating matchups for Micah Parsons and open rush lanes off twist stunts. The goal should be to heat up Jones on Sunday.\nTyreek Hill vs. the Buffalo Bills' zone coverages: Buffalo has played a mix of single-high and split-safety zone coverage on 61.6% of opponent dropbacks this season. Look for Mike McDaniel to dial up some deep, leveled route concepts to open coverage voids for Hill.\nFor more breakdowns, check out Matt Bowen's Film Room.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (vs. Las Vegas Raiders): Justin Herbert has won his past two home games against the Raiders and played well in both, tossing three TDs and zero INTs in each outing. Both teams are 1-2 with struggling defenses, but the Chargers' offense has been substantially better, which figures to be the difference. That will especially be the case if Jimmy Garoppolo (concussion) is sidelined. The Chargers' 81% win probability is the third highest in the league this week and the third highest remaining for the Chargers this season. The San Francisco 49ers (89% vs. Arizona), Chicago Bears (55% vs. Denver) and Denver Broncos (45% at Chicago) are also options, as each has their highest remaining win probability here in Week 4.\nFollow Clay's Eliminator Challenge advice all season long and read more here for other tips for Week 4.\n\nField Yates explains where Quentin Johnston stands in the Chargers receiving corps.\nI'm tempted to lean into the chalk again with a Chargers and Raiders stack built around Keenan Allen ($7,900) and Davante Adams ($8,000). With both being likely core cash-game plays, it's going to make the pair very popular in tournaments, along with Josh Palmer, who's only $4,000 and clearly mispriced for his current role with Mike Williams out for the season. If this is the route chosen, it's going to be important to not only find value to fit the primary stack, but also to try and identify lower played combinations to bring down the overall percentage hold of the lineup in order to be a bit more contrarian. Value plays like Calvin Austin ($3,300), Josh Downs ($3,500), Najee Harris ($5,500) and Javonte Williams ($5,500) will allow us that opportunity to not just save money, but to differentiate our tournament lineup from some of the others.\nMore DFS plays here.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles D/ST anytime TD (6-1 at DraftKings): Sam Howell has a sack problem. Sam Howell has an interception problem. The Eagles have a dangerous defense. It's a perfect combination. I make the fair price +438.\nKansas City Chiefs DE Mike Danna under 0.25 sacks (-125 at DraftKings): Danna has 2.5 sacks this season but has never recorded more than five in a year. Plus, his 6% pass rush win rate leaves a lot to be desired. Even against Zach Wilson and the New York Jets, this under price is too good to pass up.\nAtlanta Falcons QB Desmond Ridder over 0.5 INTs (+143): The Jacksonville Jaguars' defense ranks third in EPA allowed per designed run. That might force Atlanta to throw the ball, and that increases the chances of a Ridder pick. I have Ridder at a 47% chance to throw an interception, a value against this line.\n\nThe SuperBook and South Point sportsbooks reported sharp action on the Patriots +7 at Dallas, causing the line to drop to Cowboys -6.5. Chris Andrews, sportsbook director at the South Point, said he believes bettors ignored the Cowboys' injuries on their offensive line in last week's loss to the Cardinals. \"They're not ignoring them this week,\" Andrews said. SuperBook executive director John Murray also said sharp bettors took the Houston Texans +3 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, causing the line to drop to Pittsburgh -2.5.\nCaesars Sportsbook reported taking early action on the Broncos against the Bears in Chicago in a battle of winless teams. \"The money did come from Denver, some sharp action,\" Craig Mucklow, vice president of trading for Caesars Sportsbook, said in a company podcast. Denver opened on Sunday as a 2.5-point favorite, and the number had grown to -3.5 as of Thursday.\nMiami Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa has emerged as the favorite to win the regular-season MVP award at sportsbooks. Tagovailoa moved from +700 to +325 to win the award at PointsBet (Fanatics) after the Dolphins' 70-20 win over the Broncos last week. Ahead of the game against Denver, Tagovailoa had attracted fewer MVP bets than Bears QB Justin Fields.\n\nErin Dolan explains why she is laying the four points with the Vikings vs. the Panthers this weekend.\nMinnesota Vikings -4 at Carolina Panthers: In a matchup of winless teams, I believe the Vikings can put up more points than this Panthers' offense. The Vikings' offense has averaged 23 points, losing all three games by an average of four points. For an 0-3 team, Kirk Cousins is averaging 46 passing attempts and 358 passing yards per game. Minnesota was so close to beating the Chargers last week, if  not for Cousins' late pick at the end of the game. Both defenses are allowing 27 points per game, so this is going to come down to offense. The Panthers' offense has averaged only 18 points per game. Andy Dalton stepped in at QB last week, but Bryce Young could potentially end up back on the field. I am going with Cousins and company to win and cover on the road.\nBroncos team total OVER 24.5 points at Bears: Both of these teams are 0-3 straight up and 0-3 against the spread, ranking in the bottom two spots in the league for points allowed per game. So what can we trust? I trust the Bears' defense to continue to be terrible. Chicago has allowed 25 or more points in 13 straight losses. The Broncos' offense has averaged 23 points, so they should be able to do some damage against this defense -- and want to do damage after their own defense allowed Miami to score 70 points. The Bears have allowed all three opponents to hit over 24.5 points.\n\nChiefs -8.5 at New York Jets: The Jets are still rolling with Zach Wilson, who barely can barely lead them 10 points per game. KC's defense has been good and has the players to get to Wilson. The Chiefs will put up at least 20 against a Jets' defense that is losing patience. Count on a Travis Kelce anytime TD (-155) for Taylor Swift in the box!\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at New Orleans Saints UNDER 39.5 points: Derek Carr is dealing with a shoulder injury and chances are he will not suit up in Week 4. The Bucs are on a short work week after losing to the Eagles on \"Monday Night Football\" and now have to travel to the Big Easy. The Saints get Alvin Kamara back to run and receive out of the backfield. The Mike Evans vs. Marshon Lattimore matchup should be a fun one to watch, although Lattimore has dominated in past encounters.\n\nI definitely did not see a couple of those upsets taking place in Week 3. The Cowboys lost to the Cardinals. The Jags and Ravens also lost as big favorites at home. This is why we love the NFL. Expect the unexpected. No telling which of these Week 4 \"gimmes\" will yield an unexpected result for Pigskin Pick'em.\nPackers\nJaguars\nDolphins\nBroncos\nBrowns\nBengals\nRams\nSaints\nEagles\nVikings\nSteelers\nChargers\nCowboys\n49ers\nChiefs\nGiants"}
{"title": "Williams wants struggling Sargeant to stay in 2024", "date": "", "text": "Laurence Edmondson looks ahead to the final six races of the season and debates if Ferrari will catch Mercedes. (1:46)\nWilliams boss James Vowles says the team is \"nowhere near\" parting company with Logan Sargeant, who the team wants to keep in the car for 2024.\nSargeant has struggled in his rookie season and a string of costly crashes over the past few races has ramped up pressure on the Floridian.\nThe American's place at the team is the only spot on the grid yet to be confirmed for 2024.\nVowles has moved to end any speculation of the team replacing Sargeant, saying Williams must shoulder some of the blame for his patchy form.\n\"Logan has very clear targets that he has to hit before the end of the season and we're working with him continuously,\" Vowles said.\n\"That's the important point: we're working with him. We want him to succeed, and we want him in the car next year. This is very much on us as well.\n\"We have taken someone straight from Formula 2 without any significant testing, put a day and a half in Bahrain in this car, and then wished them well on a season that has been awfully challenging for rookie drivers, full stop.\n\"We will continue to work with Logan and invest in Logan, as we want him to succeed. He's on a journey with us as Williams.\"\nDue to the realities of being one of F1's smaller teams operating within the budget cap, Williams has been unable to introduce its upgrades to both cars at the same points this season.\nThat means Sargeant's teammate Alex Albon, who has had a hugely impressive campaign, has often run the most up-to-date version of the car.\nVowles said this is something the team takes into account when assessing Sargeant's season.\n\"Logan is not on the same aerodynamic specification as Alex.\n\"We have updates that are on Alex's car that are not on Logan's due to the amount of attrition we've had this year. So often when you see a performance offset, it's not quite what it would seem on the timing pages.\n\"We have a young driver programme that we will continue to invest in. Only at the point where all of us come to the conclusion that we've reached the end of that road will we make any decisions.\n\"But we're nowhere near that yet.\""}
{"title": "September U23 hotlist: Zaire-Emery, Savio, Simons among stars", "date": "", "text": "Welcome back to the ESPN FC hotlist, which each month highlights some of the most in-form talent aged 23 or under across Europe.\nGenerally, young but established stars like Manchester City's Erling Haaland, Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham or Barcelona Gavi aren't included -- otherwise they'd be on the list every month -- but we'll shine a light on some of those who deserve praise for their performances and who could potentially be European football's next big name.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nOne year on from his competitive debut as a 16-year-old, Zaire-Emery has grown into a key player for the French champions and is reportedly close to agreeing a new contract.\nWith the added confidence that comes with exposure to senior football, he has gone from a predominantly defensive-minded midfielder to a resourceful No. 8 who is as effective in directing and dictating as he is in recovering the ball.\nWhat immediately catches the eye is his maturity. Zaire-Emery relentlessly asks for the ball, chooses the best space to receive it and moves it on -- short or long -- with the right angles and pace. Already resilient in coping under pressure, he practically ran PSG's midfield in the recent 4-0 \"Le Classique\" win against Marseille.\nHaving started all PSG's matches so far this season, a first senior callup for France could arrive soon.\nA €20.5 million summer signing from Belgian side Royale Union St-Gilloise, Boniface has been nothing short of sensational in the Bundesliga so far. He has six goals from five games and a select few have come via spectacular individual efforts (especially his solo goal vs. Darmstadt, a neat finish at the end of a 40-meter solo run), while he has linked up seamlessly with Leverkusen's attack too.\nAside from his goals, Boniface is exceptionally hard to deal with for opposing defenders. With a reliable first touch, good upper-body strength and high-level balance, the Nigeria international is able to efficiently hold off markers to lay the ball off or spin his defender (as he did to scored the opener against FC Heidenheim.)\nLeverkusen's scouting has always been of the highest order, but it's hard to imagine that they expected Boniface to be this good already.\nWith top European clubs fighting over breakout teenagers, no one should be surprised that some of the biggest names in football have set their sights on the FC Copenhagen attacker, who plays either as a right winger or second striker.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here. Stream top leagues, tournaments and teams.\nSign up for ESPN+\nFRIDAY, SEPT. 29 (all times ET)\n• Barcelona vs. Sevilla (2:30 p.m.)\n• Hoffenheim vs. Dortmund (2:30 p.m.)\nSATURDAY, SEPT. 30 (all times ET)\n• Getafe vs. Villarreal (8 a.m.)\n• Wolfsburg vs. Frankfurt (9:30 a.m.)\n• Mainz vs. Leverkusen (9:30 a.m.)\n• Cologne vs. Stuttgart (9:30 a.m.)\n• Bochum vs. Gladbach (9:30 a.m.)\n• Heidenheim vs. Union Berlin (9:30 a.m.)\n• Rayo Vallecano vs. Mallorca (10 a.m.)\n• Girona vs. Real Madrid (12 p.m.)\n• Leipzig vs. Bayern Munich (12:30 p.m.)\n• Real Sociedad vs. Athletic (2:30 p.m.)\nA Sweden youth international with Syrian origins, Bardghji was the youngest player to make his debut for Copenhagen last season (just days after he'd turned 16) and last weekend his two goals from off the bench against Brøndby turned a 2-1 scoreline to a 3-2 victory (he'd already secured a late equaliser in the similar derby fixture last season.)\nIt's not by chance that the forward turns up on big occasions. Bardghji, who has six goals in eight games this season, plays with remarkable confidence, temperament and single-minded purpose for a teenager.\nThough there are still improvements to made in terms of his decision-making and timing of runs, he's a real threat when he cuts in from the right to set up a finish with his powerful left foot.\nThe flamboyant Brazilian has enjoyed an astonishing start to his LaLiga career, with two goals from the opening six fixtures while delighting fans with his flair and trickery.\n\"Savinho\" -- who was one of his country's stars at the U-20 World Cup earlier in the year -- spent last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven from his parent club, Troyes, and only showed glimpses of his talent, which makes his immediate impact at high-flying Girona even more puzzling.\nDespite being fully left-footed -- he tends to use his weaker right foot only for adjusting touches -- Savio's feints, acceleration, deft touch and outstanding command of his body make him extremely hard to read for a defender. Controlling the ball with little touches, he often waits for the defender to commit his body weight before darting past in the opposite direction. His nimble build and instinctive creativity also make him highly unpredictable, especially when he's allowed to drop into space on the right.\nNo stranger to the \"NextGen\" talent scene, the Japan prodigy has been on the radar since he came to the attention of Barcelona as a 10-year-old. While his time at La Masia was cut short in 2015 when he was forced to return home to FC Tokyo due to a FIFA ruling, with Barca found guilty of breaching regulations in the recruitment of young players, he did join Real Madrid at the age of 18 and was subsequently loaned out (Mallorca (twice), Villarreal, Getafe) to a varying degree of success.\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is a Norwegian football scout and executive and is the former chief executive and sporting director at AS Monaco. He will write regularly for ESPN on the business of soccer and the process of scouting.\nHowever, it was after joining Real Sociedad last summer that his career started to take off. He played a major hand in the Basque side's return to the Champions League and has already made a solid mark on this campaign.\nFrom a floating inverted role on the right, the quick, elusive and skillful winger has been in tremendous form, scoring four goals and assisting one since the start of the season. Looking beyond the end product, it's the progression in his game that makes him stand out. The positivity in his passes, take-ons and carries rank among the highest in LaLiga.\nThose who believed that the 5-foot-10 playmaker would struggle in the physical Bundesliga -- or indeed at RB Leipzig, who tend to prefer power over flair -- were soon proved wrong.\nUsually positioned to the right behind the central strikers, Simons proactively picks up smart positions and is often the obvious target for a midfielder or the right-back to set up an attack. So smooth on the ball and with a highly developed football intelligence, the 20-year-old conducts the play with layoffs, flicks and passes into the path of penetrating runners.\nWhat's more, two of his three Bundesliga goals have been rather spectacular; the first a curled effort from the edge of the box and the second after a spectacular solo run from the halfway line.\nAccording to reports, Leipzig are already seeking talks with PSG to keep the Netherlands international beyond this season's loan.\nXavi Simons goal 51st minute FC Union Berlin 0-1 RB Leipzig\nOne of the breakout forwards of the Eredivisie last season, with 15 goals in all competitions (all bar one coming after the turn of the year), the Mexico international has embarked on a similar scoring spree this campaign. Six games into the season and he's hit the net nine times, with three coming away at Ajax in a disrupted 4-0 win this week.\nBased on his relentless goal scoring, one might have expected one of Europe's big spenders to have made a move to sign him in the summer, but the reason Gimenez still finds himself at Feyenoord might be down to playing style or his physical profile.\nWhile there's no doubting his ability to find the goal -- his off-ball movement and spatial awareness are of the highest order (backed up by 8+ touches inside the opposing box per 90 minutes) -- he's not particularly quick.\nThough his determination is off the charts, he does need service and is not, as opposed to many of modern-day No. 9s, one to repeatedly beat defenders or create chances single-handedly. Yet, as the spearhead of an attack supported by creative midfielders, his presence in the box and poaching abilities could see him succeed at an even higher level too."}

{"title": "Connor Bedard and the rookies you need to know", "date": "", "text": "Several fresh-faced NHL newbies are not only poised to make an impact on the ice in their respective markets but within the field of fantasy hockey as well. Here's a look at 10 such rookies invested managers will want to watch closely heading into the 2023-24 fantasy season.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nConnor Bedard, F, Chicago Blackhawks: First off, a hearty congratulations to every dynasty/keeper league manager blessed with this year's precious No. 1 draft selection. Not only is the pick itself a no-brainer, but the runaway Calder favorite is likely to pay out rich fantasy dividends for years and years to come. Straight out of the gates, we know Bedard is poised to provide a hearty serving of minutes on the Blackhawks' top line and power play alongside veteran Taylor Hall. There's little question of that.\nAll that's left to forecast is whether he scores 60, 80, or near 100 points. My preseason guess is somewhere in the point/game range, at least to start. Hardly matters though; if you have the chance to pick Bedard in dynasty play, you're picking him. Otherwise, he initially presents as a Top-35 fantasy forward in re-draft leagues.\nAdam Fantilli, F, Columbus Blue Jackets: The kid out of Nobleton, Ontario is also supposed to be pretty good. A standout at September's Traverse City prospect tournament, Fantilli appeared NHL-ready in every way, beyond the potting of seven points on 15 shots through two games. Happily launching camp on a top-six line with Patrik Laine (\"yeah, it's going great, obviously, [Laine's] really easy to play with\"), the gifted center is endeavouring to lay a foundation for an outstanding rookie campaign.\nAfter scoring 65 points in 36 games as a freshman with the University of Michigan - and winning the Hobey Baker award - Fantilli should earn regular opportunities to prove he can hang with the grownups. Especially since this Blue Jackets squad is still a year or two away from making serious noise in the East. He's my favorite forward pick in dynasty competition outside of the young fella in Chicago.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever!

Sign up for free today be the commish!\nMarco Rossi, F, Minnesota Wild: If, and we're talking a mammoth-sized if here, he gets a shot at playing on the Wild's top line, the just-turned 22-year-old could be in for one heck of a first full round in the NHL. Many will argue that, after potting 51 points in 53 games with the AHL Wild in 2022-23, Rossi merits at least a chance to compete between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello, but he'll have to leapfrog Frederick Gaudreau Joel Eriksson Ek, and Ryan Hartman (when healthy again) to get there. A role in the bottom-six doesn't harbor anywhere near the same fantasy promise.\nKeep a close view on where the ninth-overall draft pick (2020), now three years removed from battling COVID-related myocarditis, lines up in camp.\nMatthew Knies, F, Toronto Maple Leafs: Fellow Arizonan Auston Matthews, after training with the young winger this summer, had this to say, \"He's very driven. Physically, he's more than capable of playing all 82 games and being a really good player for us.\"\nToss in a promising gig on the Leafs' second line alongside center John Tavares, plus a spot on the No. 2 power play, and we might have a fresh productive fantasy force in Toronto this season. Knies potted 21 goals and 21 assists in 40 games with the University of Minnesota before collecting five in 10 with his NHL club, including four in seven postseason contests.\nLogan Cooley, F, Arizona Coyotes: Part of the Coyotes' \"present\", as well as their future, according to coach Andre Tourigny, Cooley is already turning heads in his post-Collegiate career (see below). The advantage of playing for a rebuilding club unencumbered by ambitious expectations at present is that he'll earn plenty of minutes and ripe opportunities to do the same all season long. Why not? If not for Fantilli's exceptional showing, Cooley's 60 points as a freshman with the University of Minnesota may have sufficed in winning him the Hobey Baker. Even the most frustrated Coyotes fan can feel legitimately excited about this raw star. Fantasy managers should too.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nMatt Coronato, F, Calgary Flames: Toss the Harvard lad on the right side of Nazem Kadri (again), and let him strut his scoring stuff, is my advice. With new GM Craig Conroy and bench boss Ryan Huska at the helm, the soon-to-turn 21-year-old should earn a fair shake at the chance to fill one of the Flames' handful of vacancies up front.\nA dynamic scoring winger, Coronato has impressed at every level to date, including with the USHL Chicago Steel and in college competition. His eight points in 10 games at the 2023 IIHF men's World Championships this past May more than proves he can keep up with experienced, fully-grown pros. An obvious top-tier selection in dynasty leagues, the 13th overall draft pick (2021) could make a tangible scoring impact as soon as now.\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nLuke Hughes, D, New Jersey Devils: Long after the novelty of watching him compete on the same team as older brother Jack wears off, the youngest Hughes sibling will still be putting up points with regularity. It's only a matter of time before he supplants, or joins Dougie Hamilton, on the Devils' top power play. An immediate must-grab in keeper play, this fourth-overall draft pick (2021) already sports value in all but the shallowest of conventional re-draft fantasy leagues.\nBrandt Clarke, D, Los Angeles Kings: Having enjoyed the privilege of watching this kid compete for the Barrie Colts in person on a handful of occasions, I can assure you he's something special. A future key piece of the Kings' blue line, and top prospect at large, the 20-year-old has accomplished all he can in the OHL, and feels ready to play full-time with the club that drafted him eighth overall in 2021 (ahead of Arizona's Dylan Guenther, Coronato, and Stars' center Wyatt Johnston).\nBeing in the position to learn from one of the game's best in Drew Doughty certainly won't hurt either. While his most explosive fantasy days lie ahead, Clarke still merits monitoring in the here and now. The young defender scored 61 points in only 31 games with the Colts this past season,\nDevon Levi, G, Buffalo Sabres: As discussed in ESPN.com's fantasy goalie preview, I'm all in on Levi's potential to make the Sabres' roster this season. Maybe not right out of camp, but eventually. And once offered a spot on hockey's largest stage, I do expect him to hold his own. Lack of NHL experience aside, the 21-year-old is bright, skilled, disciplined, hardworking, and confident without seeming concerningly arrogant. A bit small, by goalie standards, but so was Henrik Lundqvist and he managed well enough.\nThis kid's all-around vibe has me convinced he's ready to sub in if/when Eric Comrie or Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen falter or fall hurt. Again, now or later. Adding to this already promising fantasy formula is that Buffalo is already good and only getting better.\nJoseph Woll, G, Toronto Maple Leafs: Unlike Levi in Western New York, Toronto's rookie netminder is expected to make his big-league club out of camp. Serving as a pro since 2019, he can't be sent down to the minors without being subjected to waivers, and fat chance Brad Treliving and Co. take that swing.\nSo, unless injured, he's going to play. More pressing to fantasy managers and Leafs' fans alike, on the assumption that Martin Jones only enters the goaltending mix should Ilya Samsonov or Woll fall hurt, is how well and how much. While seven NHL games hardly count as many, the 25-year-old won over a gazillion Toronto fans by posting a 6-1-0 record, 2.16 GAA, and .932 SV% in 2022-23. Dazzling stuff. One of the league's sneakier sleeper picks between the pipes, with a top-quality club in Toronto, Woll could conduct himself as a game-changer for fantasy managers in 2023-24. He just needs to play.\nSee also:\nTyson Foerster, F, Philadelphia Flyers\nLeo Carlsson, F, Anaheim Ducks\nJoel Hofer, G, St. Louis Blues\nReady to play? Sign up for free today!"}
