{"title": "Giants struggle again as Seahawks' defense steals the show", "date": "2023-10-03 05:21:08", "text": "After the Seahawks recover a fumble, Geno Smith threads the needle to DK Metcalf in the end zone for a touchdown. (0:38)\nEAST RUTHERFORD, NJ. -- The Seattle Seahawks' defense shined as they beat the New York Giants 24-3 at MetLife Stadium on Monday night. Giants QB Daniel Jones turned the ball over three times and was sacked 10 times.\nIt wasn't all great for the Seahawks as safety Jamal Adams was lost early in the first quarter after being evaluated for a concussion. It was his first game back since he suffered a torn left quad tendon in last season's opening game.\nThis season marks the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 Seahawks team that won Super Bowl XLVIII, a feat that seems like longer than a decade ago given all the suspect defense Seattle has played of late.\nBut on Monday night, in the same stadium where they claimed their lone Lombardi Trophy, the Seahawks turned back the clock and delivered a dominant defensive performance reminiscent of that 43-8 trouncing of the Denver Broncos.\nEleven sacks. Three takeaways plus a pair of turnovers on downs. A defensive touchdown. Only a field goal allowed.\nEat your heart out, Legion of Boom.\nCornerback Devon Witherspoon, the high-flying rookie cornerback whose aggressive style would have fit right in with the LOB, helped turn a close game into a runaway victory for Seattle with a 97-yard pick-six in the third quarter.\nThe Seahawks are 3-1 despite a long list of injuries, and they appeared to dodge another serious one when Geno Smith briefly left the game after hurting his knee. Teams usually don't like byes in Week 5, but the Seahawks won't complain about that right now.\nBuy on a breakout performance: This was already shaping up to be Witherspoon's breakout before his pick-six. He had a sack of Jones on a blitz and was credited with another sack on a backward pass. His touchdown came at a clutch time, with the Giants knocking on the door of a score that could have cut Seattle's lead to three points. The Seahawks were second-guessed left and right after taking Witherspoon fifth overall instead of Jalen Carter, who would have filled their most glaring need. But in addition to their off-the-field concerns with Carter, they also thought Witherspoon was the better player. Time will tell there, of course, but Witherspoon's immense talent is starting to shine after a slow start.\nPromising trend: Eleven sacks is a beyond promising development for Seattle's pass rush. It had been inconsistent over the first three games before exploding against the Giants. The 11 sacks tied a franchise record and more than doubled their combined total (five) heading into Monday night's game. Bobby Wagner, Jordyn Brooks, Witherspoon and Uchenna Nwosu all had two sacks apiece. This marks the first time since 1987 that a team had four players with multiple sacks in a game, per ESPN Stats & Information. The Seahawks have generated an NFL-best 46 pressures over the last two games, according to ESPN Stats & Info. They've had 20-plus pressures in both games, the first time they've done that in consecutive games since ESPN began tracking pressures in 2009.\nQB breakdown: Smith hadn't missed a snap in his first 21 games as the Seahawks' starter until he went down with a knee injury in the second quarter on a sideline tackle. He returned for the start of the second half and finished 13-of-20 for 110 yards and a touchdown. Drew Lock went 2-of-6 for 63 yards in relief, including tight end Noah Fant's 51-yard catch-and-run that set up a Walker III touchdown.\nTroubling trend: Adams' much-anticipated return lasted all of nine plays. He went down on the opening possession after taking a knee to the helmet and was ruled out after being evaluated for a concussion. Adams can't catch a break. Entering Monday night, he has missed 28 of a possible 53 regular-season games since Seattle acquired him in the blockbuster trade with the Jets in 2020. Also on Monday night, the Seahawks lost guards Damien Lewis (ankle) and Phil Haynes (calf) to injuries. Nose tackle Jarran Reed (shin) also left. -- Brady Henderson\nNext game: at Cincinnati Bengals (1 p.m. ET, Sunday, Oct. 15)\nThe Giants' offense is a mess. Jones has regressed to his old turnover-prone form. The result is the Giants' season has quickly slipped away only four ugly games into the season. Jones lost a fumble and threw two interceptions -- one that was returned 97 yards for a touchdown when the game was still in reach. Not that he received much help. The offensive line was a disaster and allowed 11 sacks. The Giants' special teams committed six penalties. This was bad. As the season slips away, the Giants will have to do something with road games in Miami and Buffalo on deck. It could get worse before it gets better.\nQB breakdown: Jones completed 27 of 34 passes for 203 yards and 2 interceptions. This isn't the quarterback everyone saw in the first season under coach Brian Daboll last season. Sure, Jones is under constant pressure, but he's also not playing well. Both can be true. The three turnovers were all on Jones. He now has six through four games this season. Did the Giants make a mistake giving Jones that $160 million deal? This was the third time in four games that he has played poorly. New York needs much better or this season will spiral out of control.\nTroubling trend: The Giants have been outscored 77-9 in first half of games this season. To say they've struggled in the first half would be an understatement. The Giants have yet to score a first-half touchdown through four games. They've managed only field goals of 44, 55 and 57 yards. Their minus-68 point differential in the first half of games is tied for the fourth worst for a team through four games in the Super Bowl era. This after the Giants talked all week about finding ways to start faster. It again didn't work.\nEye-popping NFL Next Gen stat: Seahawks tight end Fant's 19.8 expected yards after catch. That was what Fant was expected to get after being 15.34 yards from the nearest defender on his 51-yard catch late in the second quarter. But Fant got so much more, thanks to missed tackles along the sideline by inside linebacker Bobby Okereke and cornerback Adoree' Jackson. Fant racked up 46 yards after the catch on the play, and eventually was ruled down at the 1-yard line. Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III scored on the very next play. The Giants' poor tackling came back to bite them again. -- Jordan Raanan\nNext game: at Miami Dolphins (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)"}

(1:32)\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith limped off the field and missed two series late in the first half Monday night after a questionable tackle near the sideline by New York Giants linebacker Isaiah Simmons.\nSmith injured his knee on the play. He remained in the game for one more play before getting attended to in the medical tent.\n\"A dirty play. Dirty play,\" Smith told ESPN's Lisa Salters after he returned for the second half of Seattle's 24-3 victory. \"You guys can see it. It was a dirty play. It's no place in this sport for that and hopefully something happens, but other than that, the grace of God allowed me to come back into this game and I'm happy to be back out there.\"\nSmith made his displeasure known immediately. He later got flagged for taunting when he returned to the game in the third quarter.\n\nHe was still upset after the game despite the Seahawks (3-1) cruising into the bye week coming off a win. Smith finished 13-of-20 passing for 110 yards and a touchdown.\n\"I just don't respect that type of stuff,\" Smith said. \"There's no need for that type of stuff. It's a hard-fought game out there. We're all battling, but there's no need to take shots at guys running out of bounds on the sideline.\"\nSmith looked to be a bit limited upon returning and was moving gingerly on the knee. But he insists it's nothing major.\n\"I'm fine. I'm fine. God is good,\" he said.\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll's biggest gripe seemed to be more about how Smith was taken down than where. The play occurred near the Giants sideline after Smith had his pass batted back to him.\nIt actually went as a reception for minus-2 yards on the play.\n\"Yeah, that looked so dangerous,\" Carroll said. \"I don't know why we didn't see that differently. It just looked so dangerous. All of the effect of a horse-collar tackle happened, with the swing of the body that pulls down the back of the legs, and he got hurt on that play. A penalty wouldn't have rectified that, but it just looked like such a dangerous play it might have warranted a second look.\"\nThe Giants didn't feel the same about the hit. They thought it was clean.\nSimmons says he was just trying to make a tackle. Smith was running for yards after catching his own pass.\n\"I really don't got much to say about it,\" Simmons said. \"We playing football. He's mad he got hit? What do most quarterbacks do when they don't want to get hit? They go down. I don't really know what else to tell him about that.\"\nSimmons insists it was clean and that he started the tackle in bounds.\n\"Yeah, nobody is trying to hurt anybody out there. I want everyone to be great, you know what I mean? Nobody is trying to hurt anybody, so I would hate anyone intentionally trying to hurt me,\" Simmons said. \"None of that was intended. We're just trying to play hard and win.\"\nSmith originally thought it was safety Xavier McKinney who made the questionable tackle. The two had words on the field later in the series.\nMcKinney didn't seem too concerned about the play afterward.\n\"I don't know. I really don't care to be honest what he is saying or what he is doing,\" McKinney said. \"Don't really matter.\n\"Yeah, I thought the hit was fine.\" He chuckled. \"He'll be all right.\""}

(1:04)\nANAHEIM, Calif. -- Phil Nevin will not return as manager of the Los Angeles Angels, the team announced Monday.\nThe move comes a day after the club finished the season at 73-89. The Angels didn't schedule an end-of-the-season news conference with general manager Perry Minasian immediately after the season finale, raising questions about his future after three unsuccessful years in charge.\nMinasian will be available to the media Tuesday, the team said.\nIn making the official announcement, the Angels said that they have declined their option on Nevin's contract for 2024. Los Angeles will have its fourth manager in six years since the departure of Mike Scioscia, who held the job for 19 years.\nThe Angels flirted with playoff contention this season and went into \"buyer\" mode at the trade deadline. But they quickly faded from the race and placed several of their new additions on waivers.\nIn the end, Los Angeles finished 17 games behind the Houston Astros in the American League West, as well as 17 games off the pace in the wild-card race.\nThe Angels defeated the Oakland Athletics 7-3 on Sunday to close the season.\n\"I know it didn't go the way we wanted, but I'm proud of the way that room held together,\" Nevin said Sunday. \"It wasn't fun. It's not fun ending the way we did, but it's a great group in there. There's a lot of great things that are on the horizon here with the young players and the guys coming back. Good future.\"\nNevin went 119-149 in his first major league managerial job and missed the postseason in both of his seasons at the helm. He was promoted to Angels manager in June 2022 when Joe Maddon was fired in the middle of a 14-game losing streak.\nNevin, who had joined Maddon's staff as his third-base coach in November 2021, became the first Orange County native to manage the Angels.\nAs a former elite infielder who still carries himself like a ballplayer, Nevin appeared to be well-liked by his players. But the Angels didn't win for him, finishing 46-60 after he took over in 2022 before authoring the franchise's eighth straight losing record this season.\nNevin became the third MLB manager let go in four days, following Gabe Kapler of the San Francisco Giants and Buck Showalter of the New York Mets.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

(2:16)\nXander Schauffele, an automatic qualifier for the United States team at the 2023 Ryder Cup, could have been removed from the squad in a contract dispute, his father told The Times of London.\nThe golfer wanted to make three amendments to the player participation and benefit agreement but was threatened by the PGA of America to sign by the September deadline or be pulled from the team, Stefan Schauffele told the paper in a story published Monday.\n\"The PGA of America were not willing to even talk to us about [the three amendments],\" Stefan Schauffele told The Times. \"It was very late in the schedule right before the team came [to Rome] to practice because they had moved the deadline, and they said, 'If you don't sign it by then, you're off the team,' but they never gave us the contact information of their legal counsel.\n\"Saturday morning of Labor Day weekend, finally, the head of the PGA of America got wind of this, because it was not him that was blocking it, and put our lawyers in contact with the PGA of America's general counsel, and then it took a few hours to hash it out, and it was fine. Then I received a message that Xander was back on the team. That you can quote. That's the extent of this, and I think it's shameful.\"\nXander Schauffele and the Americans lost to Team Europe 16½-11½ on Sunday at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club outside Rome. Europe has claimed eight of the past 11 Ryder Cups, as the U.S. team failed to end a road drought that dates to 1993.\nThe PGA of America, which runs the Ryder Cup in conjunction with Ryder Cup Europe, declined to comment to The Times and had not immediately replied to other media outlets' inquiries.\nThe Americans had an awful start to the competition, and the emotionally charged event was heightened by a story in Sky Sports reporting a fracture on the U.S. team led by Patrick Cantlay, who allegedly thought players should be compensated to play in the Ryder Cup. They are paid $200,000 to go to the charity of their choosing.\nCantlay repeatedly denied the allegation, saying the story was false and that he wasn't wearing a team hat because it didn't fit, not out of protest. He said the Ryder Cup was about representing the country and not about getting paid for competing.\nStill, he was taunted by spectators waving their hats toward him, and U.S. teammates showed a playful side by tipping their hats at him after a match victory.\nCantlay and Xander Schauffele apparently wanted the player agreement amended so that a Netflix documentary crew didn't have access to the team room while filming a second season of the \"Full Swing\" series, for which players are not compensated.\nLater, U.S. captain Zach Johnson said the team voted unanimously to keep out cameras to preserve the \"sanctity and sacredness of\" the team room.\nStefan Schauffele said more discussions are needed between the U.S. players, the PGA of America and Team Europe about how the money from the Ryder Cup is distributed. Instead, the organization is being secretive and noncommunicative, he said.\n\"They are using players' intellectual properties to make money, and the American players don't get paid,\" Stefan Schauffele told The Times. \"More importantly, this would become a nonissue if all proceeds, net proceeds, from the Ryder Cup were to be donated to common charitable causes. Right now, the American players are asked to donate their time pro bono in the name of patriotism so these organizations can benefit from the profits.\n\"The PGA [of America] uses this money, and the PGA Tour gets 20% that goes into the retirement of every member. The 12 players supposedly need to eat it, and their intellectual property gets abused for the benefit of 200 other people. That's not right.\""}

(0:45)\nPLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- Perhaps no NBA player has been associated with load management and the league's new player participation policy more than LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, but Leonard pushed back on that policy during the team's media day Monday -- saying that \"no league policy is helping me to play more games.\"\nLeonard was making his first comments since tearing the meniscus in his right knee during the Clippers' first-round playoff series against the Phoenix Suns in April. That injury marked the second time in three years that Leonard, 32, suffered a right knee injury in the postseason. He tore his right ACL during the second round of the team's 2021 run to the Western Conference finals.\nAfter that ACL injury, Leonard missed the 2021-22 season. He has not played in more than 60 games in any season since 2016-17.\nWhen first asked about the new policy that was passed last month, which states that teams must ensure no more than one star player is unavailable for the same game, Leonard asked what the new rules were.\nWhen a reporter answered, Leonard responded by noting that his on-again, off-again availability with the Toronto Raptors in the 2018-19 season -- when he led the team to a championship -- came while he was rehabilitating a knee injury.\n\"I'm not a guy that's sitting down because I'm doing load management -- well, when I was with the Raptors, it was different; like, I was coming [off] an injury,\" he said. \"And you have to know the details from the doctor.\n\"But if the league is seeing or trying to mock what I did with the Raptors, they should stop because I was injured during that whole year. But other than that, if I'm able to play, I'll play basketball. I work out every day in the summertime to play the game. So, no league policy is helping me to play more games.\"\nRegarding the new policy, Clippers coach Ty Lue said, \"If our players are healthy, they're going to play. I know there's a big thing, like, our guys don't like to play or whatever, but that's not true. Our guys want to play. Unfortunately, they've had injuries ... So, if our guys are healthy, they're going to play, and that's all we're really focused on.\"\nLeonard suffered his meniscus injury during the first game of the Clippers' first-round series against the Suns in April. He played through it in Game 2 of that series and then was ruled out for the next three games. Leonard underwent a cleanup procedure on the meniscus on June 6.\nLeonard said he didn't do anything especially new this offseason in terms of preparing his body for the season. Instead, he focused on the fickle nature of some injuries.\n\"It's a matter of, if you're going to trip on somebody; a lot of my injuries last year, I stepped on someone's foot or ran into somebody,\" Leonard said. \"You've got to control what you can control and get the treatments that you can and listen to your body, keep moving and see what happens.\"\nLeonard added later, \"You either going to get hurt or you're going to be lucky enough to play games throughout the playoffs or the whole regular season ... I'm not trying to get to a certain amount of games. I'm trying to play the games I can play. If I'm hurt, I can't play basketball. The last two years, unfortunately, I got hurt, tore my ACL, then, at the end of the year, tore my meniscus. It's basketball.\n\"I'm a two-way player. I play hard, so injuries are going to come. I'm not out there just walking around. I play both ends of the floor. I see the best players on both ends every night. Either I'm guarding the best player or the best player is guarding me. If an injury comes, that's what happens.\"\nLast week, Lawrence Frank, the Clippers' president of basketball operations, said Leonard and Paul George -- who was sidelined by a right knee sprain in that first-round series against Phoenix -- are \"fully healthy\" entering the team's training camp in Hawaii.\nFor all the acclaim when Leonard and George joined the Clippers, the two have rarely been healthy together during their four seasons together. They played just 38 games together last season, and, all told, they've played in just 142 total regular-season and postseason games combined, during which the team has posted a 96-46 record.\nWhen asked about the league's new policy, George said, \"If healthy, absolutely, I'm suiting up, and I want to play every night.\""}

Can the Baltimore Orioles turn a 100-plus-win season into a World Series berth, or will we see a deep run from the Texas Rangers or defending champion Houston Astros?\nMLB experts Bradford Doolittle, Alden Gonzalez and David Schoenfield get you ready for it all with odds for every round, a predicted date of each team's last game and a name to watch for all 12 World Series hopefuls.\nNote: World Series and matchup odds come from Doolittle's formula using power ratings as the basis for 10,000 simulations to determine the most likely outcomes.\nJump to a team:\nTOR | TEX | TB | MIN | HOU | BAL\nARI  | MIA | PHI | MIL | LAD | ATL\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers or Rays (49.0% chance of reaching ALCS)\nWorld Series odds: 11.5% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista. Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- Schoenfield\nTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nKurkjian: From raw to really, really good »\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more »\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together (preferably with Bautista) but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- Doolittle\n\nHouston Astros\nNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champs\nALDS opponent: Twins or Blue Jays (53.6% chance of reaching ALCS)\nWorld Series odds: 12.0% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield \nReady for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000. OK, who am I kidding? You're not rooting for the Astros unless you live in Houston. -- Schoenfield\nKnowing what we know now, which teams should have done more, less -- or exactly the same?\n Judging all 30 clubs one month later »\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Remember '21. If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- Doolittle\n\nMinnesota Twins\nNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champs\nFirst opponent: Blue Jays (57.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.8% | Caesars odds: +2000\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins get healthy enough? Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis, and manager Rocco Baldelli said he'll play in the playoffs \"but won't be 100%.\" Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue, and his status is uncertain. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. They'll need these players back and producing to avoid adding another chapter to Minnesota's lengthy streak of postseason disappointments. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity will come this postseason. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros and maybe even the Rays. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. Your fondest memories of the Blue Jays remain Dave Stieb and George Bell, not Kevin Gausman and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. But the Twins ... the Twins have lost an unfathomable 18 consecutive playoff games going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins win a series (or four). Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\nCheck out the highlights from some of MLB's best young stars as they head into the postseason, including Ronald Acuna Jr., Adley Rutschman and Corbin Carroll.\n\nTampa Bay Rays\nNo. 4 seed | 99-63 | AL first wild card\nWild-card opponent: Rangers (58.0% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.3% | Caesars odds: +1200\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 13\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Can the offense get hot at the right time? When the Rays had that amazing start, the offense was on fire and led the majors in runs scored through the end of May. It has been solid since then, but nowhere near as dominant. With Wander Franco on administrative leave, Brandon Lowe out with a patella fracture and Luke Raley questionable due to a cervical strain, they're basically down to Josh Lowe from the left side of the plate (and light-hitting switch hitter Taylor Walls). That means they're going to face a lot of nasty righty relievers that they'll have to beat late in games. -- Schoenfield\nEight teams will take the field, but only four will move on.

We saw it during the 2020 postseason, a dominant showing before he had even registered 50 major league games. We saw it during this year's World Baseball Classic, with his cowboy boots and sporadic autograph sessions and seemingly endless array of clutch hits. We saw it four months later, when he nearly took down Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to win the Home Run Derby. And we'll probably see it again in October, for a Rays team that desperately needs his production with its starting rotation decimated by injuries and Wander Franco unavailable. Everyone will be looking at Randy Arozarena -- just the way he likes it. -- Gonzalez \nWhy you should root for them: It has been yet another remarkable \"How do they do it?\" season from the Rays. They lost key starting pitchers throughout the season -- Jeffrey Springs in April, Drew Rasmussen in May and Shane McClanahan in early August -- and yet remained in the hunt for the division title in the majors' toughest division until the final weekend. As always, they're aggressive on the bases and have a bunch of dominant relievers you've probably never heard of (check out the stats for one-time cast-offs Robert Stephenson and Shawn Armstrong). If you want to root for the AL team that does the most with the least amount of money, the Rays are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Out-homer them. It's really that simple, and you might say that about every other club that will confront Atlanta. But it's different when we're talking about the Rays because they might be better equipped to do it than anybody. The Rays ranked fifth in homer percentage, though they relied on homers for just 41% of their scoring, as opposed to a historic 52% for the Braves. Like Minnesota, the Rays' staff dominates the strike zone, ranking just behind the Twins in strikeout rate and just ahead of them in walk rate. But what separates the Rays is that they also ranked sixth in homers allowed percentage (third on the road, which filters out some of the park effects). No one has a better profile for winning a series against Atlanta decided by longball prowess. -- Doolittle\n\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Rays (42.0% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.2% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 5\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman the other night in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi has yet to go more than five innings while slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\n\nToronto Blue Jays\nNo. 6 seed | 89-73 | AL third wild card\nWild-card opponent: Twins (42.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.7% | Caesars odds: +1800\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. When Guerrero and Bichette reached the majors in 2019 -- Guerrero at 20 years old and Bichette at 21 -- and soon established themselves as two of the top young players in the game, it appeared all the Jays had to do was build around the two future stars. That stardom has been a little hit-and-miss for both players, however, and the Jays have yet to win a playoff game with these two. The Blue Jays have the starting rotation to go all the way, but the offense has been middle-of-the-pack all season. They need Guerrero and Bichette to get hot together. -- Schoenfield\nWe created a new set of accolades to honor the best of the regular season before October arrives.\n Passan's 2023 awards »\nReady for his October closeup: Jose Berrios was a shell of himself last year, leading the American League in earned runs allowed and not pitching in the series when the Blue Jays got knocked out by the Seattle Mariners in two wild-card games. He has since bounced back in dramatic fashion, posting a 3.65 ERA in 189⅔ innings. There are questions about the Blue Jays' underperforming offense heading into the postseason, but their rotation -- fronted by Kevin Gausman -- stands as a major strength. Berrios' resurgence has been a major part of that. And he'll finally get to show why the Blue Jays gave up two high-end prospects to acquire him from the Twins in the summer of 2021, then signed him to a $131 million extension the following offseason. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: When the Blue Jays are clicking, they're a really fun team to watch. No, Guerrero hasn't repeated his monster 2021 season, but he's still one of the biggest names in the sport. The defense, with Kevin Kiermaier and Daulton Varsho in the outfield and Matt Chapman at third, is often spectacular and leads the majors in defensive runs saved. Gausman is a legit No. 1 starter with that nasty, unhittable splitter. And it has been 30 years since they were last in a World Series, when Joe Carter touched 'em all. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Out-defend them. The Toronto pitching staff didn't do a great job of keeping the ball in the park this season and against the Braves; that's a less-than-ideal trait. Last we checked, it's hard to field a ball that flies over the fence, so our recipe here for Toronto has the obvious prerequisite that it has to have some good fortune in the homer-per-fly-ball category. But if that happens, the Blue Jays have a whopping advantage over the Braves in terms of the leading defensive metrics. In particular, their outfield can flat pick it, with the Jays more than doubling the defensive runs saved total of any other outfield. So if the Braves aren't quite barreling it up on their power swings, the abilities of Varsho and Kiermaier to chase everything down could tip a close series. -- Doolittle\n\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies or Marlins (65.4% chance of reaching NLCS)\nWorld Series odds: 22.4% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: Brewers or D-backs (63.1% chance of reaching NLCS)\nWorld Series odds: 18.6% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\nNo. 3 seed | 92-70 | NL Central champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (61.7% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 4.7% | Caesars odds: +1800\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 14\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The Brewers must get leads to the bullpen, which ranks first in the majors in win probability added (by a large margin). That's basically a proxy for \"clutch\" when it comes to reliever performance and that's what the pen has been all season in leading the Brewers to an excellent record in both one-run and extra-inning games. Closer Devin Williams throws his changeup more than 50% of the time and it's so good it has a nickname: The Airbender. Batters are hitting .098 against it. Joel Payamps has been the key setup guy while Hoby Milner and Bryse Wilson have been excellent as well -- and keep an eye on flame-throwing rookie Abner Uribe, who didn't come up until July but has pitched himself into a high-leverage role. --Schoenfield\nWhich World Series contenders must win now -- or else?\n Bradford Doolittle »\nReady for his October closeup: William Contreras never got much of a chance on star-studded Braves teams over these past few years, seeing a combined 10 postseason plate appearances in 2021 and 2022. Then the Brewers acquired him as part of the three-team trade that sent Sean Murphy to Atlanta in December 2022, and now Contreras -- Willson's younger brother -- stands at the center of a Brewers offense that needs more punch to back up its dynamic pitching staff. Contreras, Christian Yelich and the recently acquired Mark Canha are the only Brewers regulars with an adjusted OPS at least 10% above league average. Contreras needs to produce from the No. 2 spot and handle the rigors of a demanding position. This year, he proved he is up to the task. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Tired of the Braves and Dodgers? Can't find yourself rooting for a team from Philly? Then the scrappy, small-market Brewers are for you! Plus, they've never won a World Series, making it only once, way back in 1982 when they lost to the Cardinals in seven games. This is their fifth playoff trip in six seasons so they've been a consistent contender, with some playoff heartbreak along the way -- a Game 7 loss to the Dodgers in the 2018 NLCS, the late blown lead in the 2019 wild-card game. They deserve your playoff love. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Keep them off the scoreboard. The Brewers are a complete package on the run-prevention side of the game. They have a terrific rotation that looks even better in the postseason format because of their unmatched big three of Corbin Burnes, Brandon Woodruff and Freddy Peralta. They have an elite end-of-game hammer in Williams, and no one is better at bridging the gap between the starters and the closer than Craig Counsell. On top of all that, the Brewers are an elite defensive team that can win games by taking hits away in the infield and outfield alike. If the offense produces anything in October, the Brewers are going to be a team nobody wants to face. Even the Braves. -- Doolittle\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nWild-card opponent: Marlins (64.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.2% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\n\nNo. 5 seed | 84-77 | NL second wild card\nWild-card opponent: Phillies (35.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 1.2% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The rotation will have to absolutely crush it, because the Marlins were last in the NL in runs and the bullpen has been shaky at times. The Marlins are here because they excelled in one-run games (the best record in the majors), so if they can translate that success to the lower-scoring environment of playoff baseball, maybe they can surprise. With Sandy Alcantara injured, Jesus Luzardo is the No. 1 starter and when he's on, he's very tough: He's tied for second (behind only Blake Snell) for the most starts this season allowing no more than one run. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: It seems as if we've been waiting a little too long for Jazz Chisholm Jr. to emerge as a superstar, but perhaps baseball's biggest stage will bring that out of him. We know it's in there. Chisholm, 25, can be lightning in a bottle for this young, scrappy Marlins team, able to impact games with his bat and his legs and his glove (he has played a very nice center field despite never playing there before this season). Chisholm has been good but not great offensively since returning from an oblique strain in late July, but he has shown flashes of brilliance. He probably has more in him. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: If you like October weirdness, then the Marlins are your team. After all, they have a chance now for a third World Series -- even though they've never won a division title and made the playoffs in a full season just three times. Indeed, this rotation is reminiscent of the 2003 world championship group, a young staff featuring Josh Beckett, Dontrelle Willis, Carl Pavano and Brad Penny, all 27 or younger. Luzardo, Braxton Garrett, Eury Perez and Edward Cabrera are all 25 or younger. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Keep it close! The Marlins are in the postseason because they have dominated one-run games, pure and simple. They are 20 games over .500 (33-13) in one-run contests and because of that, a team with a run profile that should land them in the mid-70s in the win column is instead in the mid-80s. Of course, \"keeping it close\" isn't really a strategy. So as we look at the chances of a team that is hard to explain, we can't say that the Marlins could blow through the Braves and the rest of the bracket because they won a lot of close games. We can say that if they do wind up in the World Series, the one-run success -- wherever it sprang from -- will have held up. -- Doolittle\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nWild-card opponent: Brewers (38.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 1.5% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly. The D-backs' two co-aces could pitch them into the NLDS, but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. Carroll is certainly the star attraction but he's not alone: rookie catcher Gabriel Moreno is going to be another cornerstone player with his defense -- check out his arm -- and improving bat. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}
{"title": "After a massive shake-up, what lies ahead for the Bucks, Celtics and the East's best?", "date": "2023-10-03 10:39:34", "text": "Stephen A. Smith discusses his expectations for the Bucks this season after acquiring Damian Lillard. (1:03)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season kicks off Monday, when media day marks the start of training camp for 28 of the 30 teams across the league. (The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves kicked off their camps on Thursday.)\nThat includes all 15 Eastern Conference teams, some of which are still reeling from the seismic trades of Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks and, after a few days as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, Jrue Holiday to the Boston Celtics.\nWhat are the deals' ripple effects throughout the conference? What could they mean for the future of another star guard, the Philadelphia 76ers' James Harden? Are there more moves on the horizon for the Bucks and Celtics? What's next for the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers after mostly standing pat this offseason?\nAs camps get underway, here's a quick trip around the East, looking at the five biggest questions among the top contenders for home-court advantage in the conference.\nFor all of the attention surrounding the Bucks and Celtics for their blockbuster trades, those completed deals now push Harden's uncertain future to the forefront.\nThis summer, Harden made his feelings clear about Daryl Morey, Philadelphia's president of basketball operations and Harden's longtime ally and advocate going back to successful seasons together with the Houston Rockets. These days, though, there seems to be little love for Morey from Harden.\nNow that Lillard and Holiday are off the board, it's difficult to see the kind of star player coming back to Philadelphia that Morey has publicly declared would be required for Harden to be dealt. Until either Morey changes his stance or some team meets his terms, Harden's lone path to being paid this season is by playing for the 76ers.\nSo, how will Harden react? Will he be fully committed? Is there a world where he could remain in Philadelphia for the entire season?\nAll of these questions, and others, will be asked of Harden on Monday at the team's media day at its practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, and then in the days to come during the team's training camp in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nHarden can be asked those questions only if he actually shows up.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey and coach Nick Nurse address James Harden's absence from media day and his trade request.\nMeanwhile, the 76ers will be adjusting to life under a new coach, former Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse, and it's safe to say the league's reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, registered his feelings about the summer by tweeting Sunday afternoon, \"This offseason was fun lmao.\"\nFor a Philadelphia franchise that has been consumed by virtually constant drama for a decade, there will be no shortage of it in the coming weeks.\nThe Heat never think they are out of options when it comes to acquiring talent, a hard-earned belief from nearly three decades of team president Pat Riley's tenure lording over the franchise.\nBut it's hard to argue this summer has been anything but a disappointment for the reigning East champs. Miami attempted to acquire Damian Lillard -- the exact kind of ball-dominant guard who would have been a perfect fit alongside Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.\nHoliday, while not Lillard from an offensive standpoint, is the type of tough-minded two-way player the Heat have always gravitated toward throughout Riley's tenure and would have fit seamlessly next to Butler on the perimeter.\nInstead, the Heat's chief competition -- the Bucks and Celtics -- landed the star guards, and two key players from last season's stunning playoff run -- Gabe Vincent and Max Strus -- signed with the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively, in free agency.\n\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nThe Heat, who pride themselves on getting contributions from unheralded role players, did bring back Josh Richardson on a team-friendly deal to replace Vincent, will be moving Duncan Robinson into Strus' role as a floor spacer and scorer -- one he occupied before Strus stepped into it over the past season-plus -- and will look for contributions from second-year forward Nikola Jovic and rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr., two of the players who could've gone out in a deal for a guard who instead wound up staying put.\nMiami should remain in the hunt for any stars who become available. But this summer was a short-term setback. And while doubting either Jimmy Butler or coach Erik Spoelstra should be done at one's peril, Miami's road to a fourth conference finals in five seasons got a lot tougher over the past week.\nBetween the Bucks swinging for the fences with Lillard and the Celtics doing the same with Holiday, it's been a wild week atop the East.\nIn Milwaukee, there might not be a better one-two punch in the NBA, in terms of star power, than Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. The duo should help the Bucks' offense skyrocket up league rankings after finishing 15th last season (albeit with three-time All-Star forward Khris Middleton missing most of the season with injuries).\nBrian Windhorst explains why the Milwaukee Bucks are under tremendous pressure to win an NBA championship to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo.\nMilwaukee's perimeter defense, eighth in the league last season in opponent 3-point percentage, takes a significant step back with the loss of Holiday, arguably the NBA's best two-way guard.\nBoston, on the other hand, started the offseason by sending Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of a three-team trade to land Kristaps Porzingis and ended it with another massive swing in getting Holiday.\nThe Celtics enter training camp with arguably the best top six in the league -- Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Al Horford, Porzingis and Holiday -- but the overflow of talent leaves questions over whether Horford or White will be the one to come off the bench.\nThe four others, however, figure to end virtually every game on the court together, and give Boston arguably an unmatched level of versatility.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Windhorst: Holiday's next move\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nBeyond its top six, Boston's roster is littered with either lower-paid or inexperienced options for second-year coach Joe Mazzulla. Horford and Porzingis, the team's two stretch big men, come with durability concerns, given Horford is 37 and Porzingis has played 65 or more games only three times in nine NBA seasons.\nAnd while the Celtics still have all but one of their future firsts to put in deals even after getting Holiday, they don't have much salary to put together to make a deal to upgrade the roster.\nBy the time the Celtics and Bucks meet for the first time on Nov. 22 in Boston (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN), we'll have a lot more of an idea of what these groups look like. As of now, though, these two teams appear poised to be on a playoff collision course for the fourth time in the past seven seasons.\nAfter a five-year playoff absence, it was a rough return for Cleveland, which lost in five games to the New York Knicks as the higher-seeded team -- including twice on its home court. Throughout that first-round series, the Cavaliers looked severely hampered by their lack of postseason experience, as well as really bothered by their lack of perimeter shooting, as New York sagged far off poor-shooting options like forward Isaac Okoro throughout the series.\nThe Cavaliers made it a priority to address their shooting deficiencies this offseason, signing Max Strus from the Heat and Georges Niang from the 76ers. Both of them will give Cleveland a lot more offensive versatility and should prevent the Cavaliers from returning to the rotating cast of characters who struggled to adequately fill the fifth spot on the court last season alongside the quartet of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen.\nThe duo's presence also should allow Cleveland more versatility to play small, something the Cavs didn't have an easy way to do last season.\nThe overarching question for this season in Cleveland, however, surrounds Mitchell, and whether Cleveland can do enough to convince the four-time All-Star to agree to a contract extension next summer, when he will be one year away from free agency.\nDoing so begins with improving on last season's first-round flop. Strus and Niang were brought in to play a part in that. Another factor will be the offensive development of Mobley, who has quickly become a dominant force defensively but is still a ways away from the two-way star Cleveland will need to contend with the likes of Milwaukee and Boston.\nIt was another relatively quiet offseason for the Knicks, who made a shrewd pickup to land Donte DiVincenzo as a free agent, pairing him with Villanova teammates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart.\nBut standing pat made sense. New York had a breakthrough last season, beating Cleveland to reach the second round of the playoffs behind the play of last year's home run free agent signing in Brunson, and giving hope to the legions of Knicks fans in the tristate area that a brighter future might finally be around the corner.\nZach Lowe questions why the Knicks aren't discussed as a contender in the East given the uncertainty surrounding other teams in the conference.\nNew York is still waiting, however, for the moment when it can push in its chips for the right player. The Knicks chose not to do so with Mitchell last summer. They didn't with Beal, Lillard or Holiday this year.\nBut what if someone like Antetokounmpo or Embiid becomes available next summer? What if Cleveland struggles and Mitchell, a year away from free agency, makes it clear he won't stay?\nIf a disgruntled superstar suddenly becomes available via trade, the Knicks, between their combination of draft assets and players under contract, are positioned to make an enticing offer.\nIn the meantime, if the Knicks can build on the momentum they've created with their play last season -- their playoff series win was the franchise's first since 2013 -- the appeal of playing home games inside Madison Square Garden could return."}
{"title": "Week 5 takeaways: Revved for Red River, ACC's Notre Dame problem", "date": "2023-10-02 15:03:55", "text": "Quinn Ewers rushes for two touchdowns and throws for another, leading Texas to a big win over Kansas. (1:26)\nWith Week 5 of the college football season in the books, we're seeing some intriguing storylines beyond the Big Two conferences of the SEC and Big Ten.\nThe Red River Rivalry is lined up to be one of the biggest games in the series' recent history, West Virginia has emerged as a surprise in the Big 12 and Louisville is experiencing a resurgence in the ACC. (But can the Cardinals slay Notre Dame?)\nHere's a look at our reporters' key takeaways from this weekend's action.\nThe Longhorns and Sooners are heading to Dallas for a matchup that feels, on paper, more like their legendary early 2000s heavyweight fights.\nIn 2009, No. 3 Texas versus No. 20 Oklahoma rumbled to a 16-13 Longhorns win that then-Texas coach Mack Brown said \"was more like a fight\" a year after Texas' 45-35 victory.\nThis year, following a historic 49-0 blowout of the Sooners, No. 3 Texas faces No. 12 Oklahoma in a matchup that will mark just the third time both teams are at least 5-0 (2008 and 2002).\nLast year, Oklahoma fell to 6-7 after allowing 461 yards and 30 points per game. The Sooners signed seven ESPN 300 defensive recruits, their most since the rankings began in 2006. One of those signees, safety Peyton Bowen, the No. 17 overall player in the class, leads Oklahoma with four passes broken up and has blocked two punts. OU has allowed just 54 points this season, fewest by a Big 12 team over the first five games since ... 2009, when Oklahoma and Nebraska both did it.\nTexas, meanwhile, is 5-0 for the first time since 2009, the last time it won the Big 12. The Longhorns beat No. 24 Kansas by 26 points on Saturday, their largest win in an AP-ranked matchup since 2009 against Oklahoma State.\nThe two offenses had huge days this past weekend. Oklahoma lit up Iowa State with 523 yards, while Texas had 661 yards, its most in a conference game since the Big 12 began in 1996. Oklahoma has scored 50 or more points in three of its first five games of a season for the first time since 2008.\nIt looks like a fitting throwback matchup for the teams' final Big 12 version of their historic rivalry, once again with massive implications: According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, the winner of the 2023 edition will have better than a 70% chance to reach the College Football Playoff, while the loser will have about a 30% chance. -- Dave Wilson\nSo much for preseason polls and coaching hot seat lists. Neal Brown and West Virginia have deposited both in the rubbish bin with a 4-1 start, capped by an impressive road win on Saturday at TCU. West Virginia was picked last in the Big 12 preseason media poll, a forecast that Brown duly noted, saying in July, \"Looking forward to proving everybody wrong on that front. We won't finish there.\"\nBrown certainly faced pressure to win, and a seemingly daunting September schedule included Penn State, Pitt, Texas Tech and TCU. But many forget that even though last season didn't go well overall, West Virginia swept the Oklahoma schools and beat defending Big 12 champion Baylor. The Mountaineers returned some experienced players, especially on defense. Brown told me last week that he especially likes his defensive front, which includes junior Sean Martin and promising redshirt freshman Tomiwa Durojaiye. WVU's defense has shined during its start, allowing only 19 points per game and 3.3 yards per rush. Although Brown has a background on offense, a unit that has struggled for much of his tenure, he has found ways to generate wins and positive vibes.\nThe Mountaineers get a well-timed open week -- they emerged from the TCU outing fairly banged up -- before facing struggling Houston and Oklahoma State. They miss Texas on the schedule, so a solid bounce-back season and some stability for Brown seem well within reach. -- Adam Rittenberg\nFor the first time, Kentucky and Louisville are both 5-0 to start the season. (No, we're not talking hoops.) Both teams are also about to get a much better test of how good they really are.\nKentucky, coming off a 33-14 beatdown of Florida on Saturday at home, will travel to No. 1 Georgia. Louisville, which slipped past host NC State 13-10 on Friday, will return home to face Notre Dame.\nThe Kentucky program is as healthy as it's been under Mark Stoops, who is in his 11th season. Winning three in a row over Florida would have sounded like a fairy tale during the Wildcats' 31-game losing streak in the series from 1987 to 2007. But Stoops has stayed the course, made adjustments (such as getting Liam Coen back as offensive coordinator and plugging in key transfers such as QB Devin Leary, RB Ray Davis, WR Tayvion Robinson, OT Marques Cox, S Zion Childress and PK Alex Raynor) and maintained a tough, blue-collar approach that has served this team well. The Wildcats are averaging 6.5 yards per rush and holding their opponents to only 2.5 yards per rush.\nThe Cardinals, in Jeff Brohm's first season back at his alma mater, are 3-0 in conference play for the first time as an ACC member. They've teetered at times against their Power 5 opponents and squeaked past NC State thanks to a 53-yard field goal by Brock Travelstead in the final six minutes. But they've also found different ways to win. Louisville averaged 237 rushing yards in its first four games, but with the running game stuffed last week, it leaned on its defense. The Cardinals held the Wolfpack scoreless in the second half and forced two turnovers.\nLouisville has only two road games remaining on its schedule. Kentucky has four road dates left, including three of its last four contests. It's a stretch to think either of these teams is going to contend for a playoff berth, but their season-ending clash on Nov. 25 could be the most anticipated in years, with the winner potentially having a chance to win nine-plus games. -- Chris Low\nSpeaking of Louisville, the Cardinals have a chance to do something no other ACC team has done in the regular season since Miami in 2017: Beat Notre Dame.\nDuke was two minutes away from doing it Saturday night. Its defense then gave up two big plays on the final drive, Notre Dame scored the winning touchdown with 31 seconds left and a long winning streak was extended. The Fighting Irish have won 30 straight regular-season ACC games, passing Florida State (1992 to 1995) for the longest such streak.\nNotre Dame takes a lead on Audric Estime's 30-yard touchdown against Duke with 31 seconds left.\nThere are two key differences here: (1) Nobody will ever confuse the Notre Dame teams of the past five years with those dominant Florida State teams (no offense Irish, these are just facts) and (2) unlike Florida State, Notre Dame is not actually an ACC member in football, which is the biggest gut punch of all for the league.\nThe ACC literally asked for this when the Irish joined the league for the 2013-14 season in all sports but football and men's hockey. A football scheduling partnership -- in which Notre Dame would play five or six ACC teams annually -- seemed like a win-win decision at the time. Notre Dame would get help filling out its schedule; the ACC would get help by boosting its nonconference scheduling and creating more attractive matchups for TV.\nBut this has been a losing proposition in recent years. Though Clemson did defeat Notre Dame in the 2020 ACC championship game and has previously beaten the Irish both in the regular season and the College Football Playoff, nobody else has had close to the same success. That speaks more to the state out of the league outside Clemson, as the ACC works to enhance its football teams.\nThis year has been a much better start, with six undefeated teams through the first four weeks. But even undefeated Duke could not get the job done. Undefeated Louisville is up next. The rest of Notre Dame's ACC schedule for this season? Pitt, at Clemson and Wake Forest. Someone in the ACC has to find a way to step up and end the streak once and for all, for the good of the conference. -- Andrea Adelson\nWith the Pac-12 home to four of the top six offenses nationally (Washington, Oregon, USC and Washington State), Utah knew its quest for a three-peat would be a daunting one. Friday's performance at Oregon State, where Utah couldn't crack 200 total yards in a 21-7 loss, only strengthens the fact that the Utes need Cameron Rising back fast.\nUtah's offense ranks last in the conference (297.6 yards per game), and Rising would provide some much-needed stability to a unit that went five straight quarters without scoring prior to tight end Thomas Yassmin's TD reception in the fourth against the Beavers. The schedule is about to get amped up to another gear, with two of Utah's next three games following a bye week coming against USC and Oregon. If Rising (18-7 career record with 45 touchdown passes) can make his 2023 season debut on Oct. 14 against California and get his feet wet for the stretch run, the Utes' quest to keep the Pac-12 title in Salt Lake City for another year will receive a serious boost. -- Blake Baumgartner\nIn a decisive win over Mississippi State, quarterback Jalen Milroe was efficient, the Crimson Tide got its running game going and the defense had four sacks. This is all a positive push toward Alabama reasserting itself on the national stage, but as coach Nick Saban said after the game, the team isn't where it wants to be or needs to be.\nMilroe throws a nice deep ball, but nobody is going to mistake him for the nation's most prolific passer -- especially when he only threw it 12 times on Saturday. If this is Bama's identity, though, then embrace it and continue to make it better. No two-loss team has been to the CFP, which makes this Saturday's game between Alabama and Texas A&M critical. They each have a nonconference loss and are squarely in the mix to win the SEC West. The winner will have a huge edge. -- Heather Dinich"}

(2:34)\nLONDON -- There was a point on Monday, as a Dominos pizza truck parked up next to Craven Cottage in the build-up to the game, when it became clear Chelsea's woeful form in front of goal was beginning to transform from a persistent narrative to a point of ridicule.\nDominos, in a clear (albeit potentially factual) publicity stunt, had a digital billboard showing how many pizzas they had sold in the five weeks since Chelsea last scored a Premier League goal. It was nearly 10 million and counting. It was humorous -- and for rival fans a bit of schadenfreude -- but more traditional stats about Chelsea's goal drought make for more grim reading.\nComing into Monday's local clash with rivals Fulham, Chelsea had not struck in the league since a 3-0 victory against Premier League strugglers Luton in August, despite the Blues creating chances. Chelsea's five goals were tied for the second-fewest in the Premier League this season (only Burnley had fewer) and their 5.5% shot conversion was the lowest of any team, failing to score with their previous 49 attempts on goal.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Maybe Chelsea have been playing well?\nLike last season under the eventually sacked Graham Potter, Chelsea have remained a team that creates chances but rarely scores. They claimed a narrow 1-0 win over Brighton in the EFL Cup last week. Monday's premier task, then, was to break that deadlock in the Premier League.\nChelsea did that, finally, as part of a much-needed 2-0 victory on Monday that will come as a great relief. Who it came from -- winger Mykhailo Mudryk -- will come as a point of solace, too.\nMudryk arrived at Chelsea as a mark of their enduring appeal last January in a deal that could reach €100 million, but in his ensuing 23 appearances he became the poster boy for the kind of expensive signing that failed to make the grade at Stamford Bridge. Recently, Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino put Mudryk's errors down to confidence and a matter of psychology - an issue he decided to fix by competing against his winger at a game of crossbar challenge.\nWhen pressed in a post-match news conference on why the manager continued to pick Mudryk despite his dry spell, Pochettino said he had earned his chance: \"It is about maturity. It takes time. There was a massive change to the team when he arrived here, and when you arrive to a team it is not easy to settle. When too many young players arrive at a team it is not solid.\"\n\"He showed in his training sessions that he deserved [the chance to play],\" Pochettino added.\nMudryk's moment of redemption came after 18 minutes on Monday. The Ukraine winger flashed a rare look of composure as he chested down a cross from defender Levi Colwill before calmly slotting below Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno for his first goal for Chelsea.\n\"It's all about the design and the strategy that you can provide the young guys, to trust and feel comfortable in themselves, and to feel like home,\" Pochettino said. \"Like everyone, they need to feel like they belong to this club. It's all about [giving them] time and also finding the right people that can help.\"\nIt got even better immediately after the goal. Like the old saying about London buses -- \"You wait for ages and then two come at once\" -- Chelsea scored again seconds later. This time, Cole Palmer pounced on a sloppy pass from Fulham's Tim Ream and slid a pass through to Armando Broja, who just about managed to poke the ball home to complete the quick-fire double. It wasn't as pretty, but it was a goal nonetheless.\n\"For us it's about motivation, even when we were losing and we didn't win at the beginning of the season we were calm and kept the belief,\" Pochettino added. \"Now we have won two games in the last two days, but we always want to keep improving and to build the belief and the confidence because they need to feel that.\"\nMonday's victory does not mark the end of Chelsea's struggles though. There is more work to be done before they can claim to have turned a corner.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Mudryk, despite his well-taken goal, still did not quite shine on the left and was taken off due to a quad injury at half-time. There should also still be concern over the lack of style and personality needed to produce consistent performances.\nNone of this is to mention the issue of the club's league position. Even after this victory, they're still only in 11th place, a point behind Manchester United, and Chelsea's task will only get tougher.\nChelsea have arguably wasted obvious chances to win points at the start of the season, with away defeats to West Ham and Nottingham Forest, as well as an uninspiring 0-0 draw to Bournemouth. The schedule is about to get much tougher: After a trip to Burnley, Chelsea then face a daunting run of against Arsenal (home), Brentford (home), Tottenham (away) Manchester City (home), Newcastle (away), Brighton (home), Manchester United (away).\n\"In football, you always have to be ready for everything,\" Pochettino said. \"This Saturday [against Burnley] is going to be tough also. It is important for the players to have a lift after two victories, but we will keep working.\"\nAll of those worries can live for another day, though. On Monday, Chelsea broke their deadlock and halted a worrying slide in the league. There can be no ridicule in that."}
{"title": "The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Diaz's offside goal", "date": "2023-10-03 04:30:31", "text": "Dale Johnson explains the sequence of events that led to Luis Diaz's goal being incorrectly disallowed vs. Tottenham. (1:41)\nVideo Assistant Referee causes controversy every week in the Premier League, but how are decisions made, and are they correct?\nAfter each weekend, we take a look at the major incidents, to examine and explain the process both in terms of VAR protocol and the Laws of the Game.\n- How VAR decisions have affected every Prem club in 2023-24\n- VAR in the Premier League: Ultimate guide\nIn this week's VAR Review: What went wrong in the VAR room to disallow Luis Diaz's goal for Liverpool at Tottenham Hotspur, Curtis Jones' red card, a missed penalty award for Brentford and the rest of the weekend's events.\nWhat happened: Mohamed Salah played Luis Díaz through on goal in the 34th minute, and the forward produced a superb strike across goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to score. However, the offside flag immediately went up for offside, and the VAR, Darren England, began a check. (watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal, incorrectly communicated.\nVAR review: How do you get a decision both right and disastrously wrong at the same time? It's a question that refs chief Howard Webb and his leadership team will have to answer in the coming days and take steps to ensure an inexcusable mistake of this magnitude can never happen again. It's the biggest error the Premier League has seen.\nEngland and the assistant VAR, Dan Cook, were swiftly both stood down from duties in fixtures on Sunday and Monday, but that kind of action is of no comfort to Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool players. Both are unlikely to be selected in the upcoming matchweeks.\nThe VAR made one very simple but inexplicable error: He lost concentration and got the on-field decision incorrect when completing the check.\nWhen the VAR looked at the position of Diaz, it quickly became apparent that he was very clearly onside. It was checked with the use of the offside lines in the background -- you see proof of this on the VAR feed when the technology operator zooms in to place them.\nAnd this is where it starts to go wrong. England somehow now thinks he is checking a goal, rather than a disallowed goal (he cannot see the overlay shown on TV and in the stadium). If he was confirming an overturn he would lock in the offside lines, but as he now thinks the on-field decision is \"goal,\" there's no prerequisite to do so when the onside is an obvious one.\nEngland cleared the review so quickly and with such confidence he didn't even get the opinion of the assistant VAR. Perhaps that was the issue, it was such a regulation \"onside\" decision that he thought he would wrap it up. And he said \"check complete.\"\nPerhaps the decision was so straightforward that England lost focus and forgot what the on-field decision actually was, because by saying those two words, he's telling the on-field officials their decision is correct. Rather than clearing the goal, he was mistakenly telling the referee the offside call was correct.\nSemi-automated offside technology, which Premier League clubs chose not to introduce this season, would have made no difference in this situation because the error is the communication with the referee. England correctly identified that Diaz was onside.\nPhil Bentham was brought in from rugby league last season as VAR coach specifically to work on communication. Lessons will need to be learned about the process of \"check complete.\"\nWhat happened next came so fast, there was no time to react within protocol. Just two seconds after the VAR has said \"check complete,\" Spurs took the free kick, which creates a cut-off point. Nothing can be reviewed after a restart. (This doesn't apply to penalties awarded for offences before the half-time or final whistle, as play was still active at the time of the offence.)\nSeven seconds later, the VAR team realised their error. Panic set in, but they decided they couldn't go against protocol so they let play continue. But in this situation, where a very serious mistake has been identified within seconds of the restart, football would rather the VAR went against protocol to achieve the fairest outcome for the game. The match should have been stopped.\nNot only did the VAR team fail to react, but also the management team, which could have stepped in and told the VAR team to roll the game back.\nThere was the opportunity to fix it, and it was missed.\nThe VAR audio of the incident will be released, which will at least provide transparency for what happened.\nErrors in process keep happening, even at the very highest level. At the World Cup last year, France had an injury-time equaliser disallowed against Tunisia when the VAR ruled Antoine Griezmann was offside after the kickoff had been taken.\nAnd only a few weeks ago in the Bundesliga, Heidenheim had a penalty ruled out for offside following a foul by Borussia Dortmund's Sébastien Haller. The officials allowed Haller to be substituted, and during that process the VAR realised the offside decision was incorrect. The penalty was reinstated, but Haller, who should have been sent off for pulling back the striker, was no longer on the pitch. He was only shown a yellow card on the bench instead.\nThat doesn't excuse what happened in the Premier League on Saturday.\nQuestions will be asked about the wisdom of allowing England to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, along with Michael Oliver as a team of English officials, to take charge of a league game between Sharjah and Al Ain. In terms of preparation, it's no different than a game in the Europa League and Europa Conference League; the officials were back from the UAE on Friday lunchtime. But it's the optics of travelling to the Middle East to take up an approved, paid job and then coming back to the Premier League and making a huge mistake.\nWebb has been in charge of referees for only nine months, yet he faces the huge problem of public perception that refereeing is getting worse. The stats from the Independent Key Incidents Panel suggest standards are improving, but catastrophic mistakes like that at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium take a hammer to any progress.\nLiverpool issued a statement on Sunday evening insisting the incident has \"undermined sporting integrity,\" and you can understand their point. But the Laws of the Game specifically state that a mistake in the VAR room is no different from a genuine error on the pitch. France appealed to FIFA to try to get their goal back, but were told they had no grounds. Usually, a game would be replayed only if there was a misapplication of the laws, rather than just an incorrect decision.\nThis will now be tough on England and will take some coming back from. Last season he was shadowed by The Guardian and reference was made to how the official seemed mentally exhausted after awarding a controversial late penalty to Manchester City against Fulham. This is going to be even tougher.\nWhat happened: The game was goalless in the 26th minute when Curtis Jones challenged Yves Bissouma for the ball, and committed a foul. Referee Simon Hooper produced a yellow card, but there was a VAR check for a possible red (watch here.)   \nVAR decision: Yellow card upgraded to red.  \nVAR review: Ex-pros and supporters are always split when a player receives a red card when they have played the ball first, but that doesn't excuse the player for how he may catch an opponent. Jones will no doubt feel himself unlucky to get a red card, but the nature of the challenge always meant a VAR intervention was likely.\nAs explained last week in the review for Malo Gusto's red card for Chelsea against Aston Villa, when the replays show that an opponent's leg has effectively been bent by the tackle, that will be seen as evidence of excessive force.\nJones' foot came off the top of the ball and led to him catching Bissouma high on the shin and forcing his leg backward. It's similar in nature to the dismissal of Manchester United midfielder Casemiro against Southampton last season (though that was a clearer red card due to the way he went into the challenge).\nJones was unlucky, but a VAR intervention for a red card was always likely.\nSome supporters complained that England showed Hooper a freeze frame of the point of contact as he walked over to the pitchside monitor, effectively pre-judging the review. Yet as the monitor is specifically there to confirm an overturn (though the referee retains the right to reject the advice of the VAR), a referee is always going to be shown the clearest evidence to support the decision. Hooper will be told as he walks over the screen exactly what he will see and the kind of replays he will be offered. The referee always has the option of requesting additional angles and replay speeds.\nWhat happened: Brentford had a corner in the final moments of the first half. Nicolás Domínguez jumped for the ball with Vitaly Janelt, and the ball appeared to brush the raised arm of the Forest player as it was nodded on. When the ball bounced inside the area, it was then touched by the hand of Willy Boly.\nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: After the decision to penalise Wolves' João Gomes for his raised arm at Luton Town last weekend, you could understand questions over the first handball by Domínguez. His arm was high, and it was hit by the ball. He escapes because it hit him at point-blank range and the arm position was justified when jumping.\nBoly had his arm by his side, so it would need to be a deliberate handball, and while there was a movement, it appeared to be natural rather than specific to push the ball away.\nWhat happened: Yoane Wissa closed down Forest goalkeeper Matt Turner following a back-pass by Murillo. The Brentford striker got a toe to the ball and pushed it toward goal, and was then caught by Turner as the keeper tried to make the clearance. A defender cleared the ball before it crossed the line.  \nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: This definitely should have been a penalty, and that the error was made by Michael Oliver, who was in the UAE with Darren England, only adds to the issues facing PGMOL this week.\nWissa gets to the ball first and is kicked by the goalkeeper. Perhaps it was Wissa's immediate reaction to get up and play on, rather than appealing for the foul, which threw Oliver. Either way, it was a mistake not to intervene.\nWhat happened: Ollie Watkins doubled Aston Villa's lead in the 21st minute when finishing into the corner. It looked initially as though goalkeeper Jason Steele had let a weak shot past him into the corner of the net, but was he impacted by Nicolò Zaniolo in an offside position in front of him? (watch here)\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\nVAR review: It provides a good comparison with an incident from a month ago, when Manchester City saw a goal allowed to stand when Manuel Akanji was in front of Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno. PGMOL admitted that goal should have been ruled out by the VAR, and on the face of it, this is the same. Then last week Manchester United had a goal ruled out by the VAR when Rasmus Højlund was in front of Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford on Jonny Evans' header. So what's the difference, and why wasn't Villa's goal ruled out?\nThe key difference between Akanji and Zaniolo are the actions of the players in front of the goalkeeper. Akanji made an obvious action to play and/or evade the ball on its way to goal, which had to affect the goalkeeper's decision-making. However, Zaniolo makes absolutely no movement at all -- and this makes any impact on the keeper far more difficult to evaluate.\nThe VAR has decided that he couldn't be certain there was any impact on Steele in the Brighton goal. It's certainly a situation that will split opinion.\nThe disallowed Man United goal was slightly different in interpretation, as Højlund was in direct contact with the Burnley goalkeeper so he had to be considered to be having an impact.\nWe can also look at Crystal Palace's goal at Old Trafford on Saturday. Although there were two players in an offside position in front of goal, they were not impacting André Onana.\nWhat happened: Villa got a third goal in the 26th minute when Pervis Estupiñán diverted a shot from Moussa Diaby into his own net. However, Solly March was adamant he was fouled in the buildup to the goal, which was checked by the VAR (watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal stands. \nVAR review: There's no doubt that March was fouled by Douglas Luiz, who effectively fell into the Brighton player and brought him down. That means the only judgement for the VAR is on the attacking phase: Did the incident happen too far back in the move for it have a material impact?\nIt's a tough call, because you could judge winning the ball to be crucial to a goal whenever it happens in the buildup. But, in the Premier League, at least, there has been a desire not to look too far back to disallow goals for a foul.\nLast season, 10 goals were disallowed because a foul in the leadup to a goal. From Phil Foden's goal against Liverpool for a foul by Erling Haaland, to Leandro Trossard's strike for Ben White holding on to the arm of Leicester City goalkeeper Danny Ward. But in each case, the goal came very quickly after the incident.\nAfter March is fouled there is another 50-50 challenge for the ball, so Villa didn't achieve possession directly as a result of the foul. There are then several passes over 15 seconds before Diaby has a first shot on goal, which was saved by Steele, before his second effort went in off Estupiñán.\nIt's a tricky judgement call on the attacking phase, but it's consistent in the application we've seen in English football.\nWhat happened: Brighton & Hove Albion got a goal back in the 50th minute through Ansu Fati. The goal came after João Pedro had go to the goal-line and attempted a cut back, and eventually got the ball to a teammate at the second attempt. The VAR began a very lengthy check on the goal. (Watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\nVAR review: It took an inordinate amount of time for what seemed like a pretty straightforward VAR check, which looked at two possible situations.\nIn total, the review took 2½ minutes. First, there was a question of the ball being out of play when Pedro controlled it, but it soon became clear the whole of the ball hadn't crossed the goal-line. Second, whether a possible offside against goal scorer Ansu, which seemed to go on and on.\nIt doesn't matter that Pedro's touch sends the ball backwards, the direction the ball goes doesn't matter -- only the position of the attacking player who receives the ball. But the situation is complicated slightly as John McGinn has run off the pitch in trying to challenge Pedro -- it gives the immediate impression that Ansu has to be offside. But in law, McGinn is considered to be on the goal-line, which makes goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez the second defensive player, and the one who creates the offside line.\nThe VAR seemed to spend a long time trying to determine the correct frame for the kick-point by Pedro, but even during this process, it seemed very evident from the naked eye that Ansu was being played onside by the heel of Martinez. The VAR needs to apply the lines to prove this, of course, but it took far too long for what was essentially a straightforward situation.\n\nWhat happened: Manchester United were already trailing 1-0 to Crystal Palace in the 59th minute and looking for a way back into the game. Bruno Fernandes lifted a ball into the box aimed for Marcus Rashford, and the ball hit the hand of Joel Ward before it could get to the striker. United players appealed for a penalty, but referee Chris Kavanagh said no.    \nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: While Ward did check over his shoulder for the flight of the ball, there's no way this could be considered deliberate after the ball flicked off his hand. Ward also had his back to the ball when it hit him, and his arm was close to his body in an expected position.\nPoor defending to misread the flight, but not a handball offence.\nWhat happened: Palace had a handball appeal of their own in the 90th minute when the ball hit the arm of Sofyan Amrabat. Did Palace have any grounds for a spot kick?\nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: As with Ward, Amrabat had his arm close to his body, so there was no chance that the VAR, Peter Bankes, would advise a penalty kick.\nAmrabat also had the ball hit onto him at close proximity by Jairo Riedewald.\nWhat happened: Newcastle United were awarded a penalty in the 75th minute when Ameen Al Dakhil brought down Anthony Gordon. The Burnley defender appealed against the decision, and there was an automatic check made by the VAR, Jarred Gillett.\nVAR decision: Penalty stands, scored by Alexander Isak. \nVAR review: A very simple and quick check, despite Al Dakhil's claims that he had got to the ball. It was clear from the angle behind the play that it was a foul, and referee Thomas Bramall had made the correct decision.\nSome parts of this article include information provided by the Premier League and PGMOL."}

(1:27)\nLove it or loathe it, VAR is now an established part of the modern game. When it was introduced back in 2017 we were all lulled into a false sense of security: there would be no more controversy and every decision would be correct.\nIt's not quite worked out like that as human error cannot be eliminated.\nFrom wrongly disallowed goals, to penalties scored after full-time, VAR is never far from the headlines.\nVAR has gone to the very top of the game, having an influence on the results of World Cup and Champions League finals. Countless matches in competitions all over the world have been either aided or -- depending on your own opinion of the controversial officiating tool -- blighted by its involvement.\nIt's worth noting that by \"wild moments\" we're not talking about common contentious fouls and free kicks, nor are we raking back through all the countless times players have been adjudged to be fractionally offside at an atomic level. Instead we focus on some of the notable occurrences when VAR intervention has led truly baffling scenes to break out during a football match.\n- How VAR has affected every Premier League club\n- VAR in the Premier League: The ultimate guide\n- Don't have ESPN? Get instant access\nAntoine Griezmann thought he had scored a dramatic equaliser for France in the 98th minute, but there was a VAR review for offside. But it turned out to be an illegal review.\nVideo evidence showed that referee Matthew Conger had restarted the match, before blowing the final whistle. That meant that by VAR protocol it wasn't possible to review the offside offence. The goal was disallowed and France lost 1-0 to a Tunisia side that headed out of the tournament in the group stage.\nFrance protested against the disallowed goal, but FIFA rejected that appeal. Luckily Les Bleus were already through to the round of 16 and the incident made no difference to their position on top of Group D.\nAn almighty error as the VAR, Darren England, somehow messed up the onfield decision and thought he was checking a goal, when he was in fact checking a disallowed goal.\nEngland worked out that Liverpool forward Luis Díaz was onside, and told the match referee \"check complete.\" But this meant he was saying the on-field decision was correct ... when the on-field decision was offside.\nThe game was 0-0 at the time, and Spurs then scored a minute later and went on to win 2-1.\n- The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Diaz's offside goal\nThe game in September 2022 was 2-2 in added time when Juventus thought they had snatched all three points when substitute Arkadiusz Milik headed home, but the goal was disallowed following a VAR review for offside.\nLeonardo Bonucci was judged to be distracting the goalkeeper as Milik's effort flew towards goal.\nBut the VAR had missed a Salernitana player close to the corner flag who was playing the whole Juventus attack onside. Juve had two players sent off as they protested.\nThe incident led to Serie A bringing in semi-automated offside technology in the middle of the season.\nIn September 2023, Heidenheim were trailing 2-1 at Dortmund in the 76th minute when Jan-Niklas Beste moved into the area and was pulled back by Sébastien Haller. The referee pointed to the penalty spot, but was told by the VAR that Beste was offside. The penalty was cancelled.\nDortmund then decided to substitute Haller, during which time the VAR realised he had made an error in the offside review. There had been a \"deliberate play\" of the ball by Haller, which reset the phase and meant Beste was actually onside.\nThe referee was sent to the pitchside monitor and change the decision to a penalty. Haller should have been sent off for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, but the officials had allowed him to be taken off. The Dortmund player was only booked on the bench, but Heidenheim should have been playing against 10 men. At least they got their penalty ... eventually. It was scored and the game ended 2-2.\nHistory was made in the Bundesliga in April 2018 when Mainz were awarded a penalty during half-time of their match against Freiburg. The referee had signalled the end of the first half and sent the players to their dressing rooms after Mainz had a penalty appeal turned down when right-back Daniel Brosinski's cross deflected off Freiburg centre-back Marc-Oliver Kempf's hand and was saved by goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow.\nAs the players headed for the locker rooms, referee Guido Winkmann ran over to the other side of the pitch to watch the replay on a monitor. He awarded the hosts a penalty, recalling the entire Freiburg side and the handful of Mainz players who had left the pitch.\nSix minutes after the half-time whistle had blown, Pablo de Blasis scored the penalty to put Mainz 1-0 up. He added a second to seal a 2-0 win, though only after the start of the second half was delayed as ground staff had to clear reams of toilet roll thrown on to the pitch by irate Freiburg fans during the break.\nOne of the most costly VAR fails ever came during the A-League Grand Final in May 2018, when a total catastrophe befell the system during Australia's biggest game of the season.\nNine minutes into the title decider, the VAR camera feed went offline for roughly 30 seconds, during which Melbourne Victory managed to score a goal against Newcastle Jets. Television replays showed that the goal was clearly offside, but the VAR system could not be deployed to rectify the situation. Alas, by the time the technical staff managed to get the VAR camera back online the game had resumed and it was too late to review the phase of play in question so the Victory goal was allowed to stand.\nKosta Barbarouses' decisive strike proved to be the only goal in a game which Victory fans still refer to as \"the heist in the Hunter\" -- a reference to one of the McDonald Jones Stadium's former names.\nTottenham once again found themselves on the wrong end of a chaotic VAR episode then they played host to Watford on New Year's Day of 2019. Trailing 0-1 since the sixth minute of the match following Abdoulaye Doucoure's opener, Spurs finally looked to have broken through the Hornets' blockade in the 86th minute when Dele Alli sprang to score a late equaliser. However, celebrations were muted while the goal was checked by VAR for a possible handball by Alli in the build-up.\nWith most people inside the stadium already at a loss as to what was going on, the confusion was ramped up several notches when Alli's goal was simultaneously given by the referee AND declared to have been disallowed by a message on the big screens around the ground. The game then resumed for its final few minutes, and full-time came with most in attendance utterly clueless as to what the final score was (1-1).\nSPAL had every right to feel aggrieved in February 2019 when they saw what might have been a winning goal against Fiorentina chalked off by VAR. The hosts thought midfielder Mattia Valoti had put them 2-1 up against La Viola in the 77th minute, only for referee Luca Pairetto to intervene and rather sour the moment. Attention was drawn to a foul made at the opposite end of the pitch in a previous phase of play in which Fiorentina forward Federico Chiesa was felled in the SPAL penalty box several minutes earlier.\nAs such, following a VAR review, the referee cancelled out SPAL's goal and instead awarded a penalty to Fiorentina, which Jordan Veretout dispatched to put the away side 2-1 up in a remarkable turnaround. Fiorentina went on to win the match 4-1 thanks to additional goals from Giovanni Simeone and Gerson scored in the final 10 minutes, leaving SPAL to wonder what might have been.\nMEDIA RELEASE:Temporary dispensation: no cautions for goalkeeper encroachment during Kicks from the Penalty Mark at the @FIFAWWC 2019.➡️ https://t.co/8Lu7hW207x pic.twitter.com/udqs1B1ODb\nAs if major international tournaments aren't stressful enough, football's lawmakers the International Football Association Board (IFAB) decided to add an extra layer of pressure to the 2019 Women's World Cup by changing the rules regarding penalties halfway through the competition. The tournament had seen several goalkeepers shown yellow cards while facing penalty kicks after being flagged by VAR for moving off their line a fraction too early, resulting in the kicks being retaken. After a succession of controversial incidents during the group stage, the IFAB approved an emergency request from FIFA to make a \"temporary dispensation\" to the law, thus granting 'keepers a reprieve of sorts.\nAs such, the temporary dispensation removed the need for referees to issue mandatory yellow cards for encroachment on the basis that the presence of VAR alone should be enough to deter keepers from jumping the gun -- apart from during penalty shootouts, when the original law would still apply. Clear as day, then.\nThis is incredible. In added time in Bolivia, referee goes to sidelines to make decision to award Always Ready against Bolívar.

But check out how far the Bolívar defender has run into the box before penalty is taken.pic.twitter.com/ccf6bBfni4\nAlways Ready were trailing 1-0 as they entered the final few seconds of added time in their game against Bolivar in August 2019. In a desperate attempt to score an equaliser, they appealed to referee Raul Orosco for a penalty following an aerial clash inside the area. Orosco went over to the sidelines to watch a replay of the incident. Content with what he'd seen on the monitor, the official then returned to the pitch to award the penalty while making the requisite \"VAR\" hand gesture. However, it was at this point it dawned on Orosco that VAR hadn't actually been implemented in the Bolivian Primera Division and so he tried to transform his \"TV screen\" signal into a hurried point toward his earpiece instead.\nThe awarding of the penalty sparked chaos as both sets of players and coaching staff argued on the field for a full 10 minutes, with many repeating the \"VAR\" gesture as they demanded answers. Eventually, sufficient order was restored to allow Always Ready to finally take their controversial spot kick, which hit the post.\nWith minutes to go before half-time in the German second-tier clash between Holstein Kiel and VfL Bochum in October 2019, midfielder Michael Eberwein was busy limbering up with the rest of the Kiel subs behind his side's goal when he made the fatal error of stopping a wayward shot before the ball had gone all the way off the pitch. VAR spotted that this innocent error was in direct contravention of the laws of the game governing substitutes interfering with play, and asked the referee to come over to consult the footage. Sure enough, a penalty was awarded to Bochum and Eberwein was shown a yellow card.\nBochum striker Silvere Ganvoula M'boussy, whose shot off target had sparked the furore, stepped up to convert the penalty. Just to make matters worse, Eberwein had yet to make his debut for Kiel at the time, meaning that he'd also managed to concede a spot kick without making a single appearance for the club. As yet another bitter digestif for Kiel, the German FA (DFB) consulted with the IFAB on the decision and were told that, whilst the referee should have initially given the penalty, the incident did not qualify as an \"exceptional circumstance\" which justified an intervention by VAR, meaning the spot kick really should not have been awarded.\nSpurs (them again) found themselves subjected to a decision so ludicrous that it actually helped bring about a change in the way the Premier League interpreted the law. After falling into line with the rest of Europe and adopting a stricter application of handball, the opening weeks of the 2020-21 Premier League season had already been littered with controversial decisions. Then came the case of Eric Dier.\nSpurs were leading by a single Lucas Moura goal against Newcastle as the September fixture entered added time, only for the visitors to be gifted the very softest of penalties when Dier leapt for a header alongside Andy Carroll. The Newcastle striker won the duel and nudged the ball innocuously against the Spurs defender's flailing arm while he had his back turned.\nReferee Peter Bankes initially missed the non-incident but VAR was on hand to draw his attention to an infringement of the newly implemented (and much-maligned) handball law stating that any ball-to-hand contact in the area might be penalised regardless of whether said contact is intentional or otherwise. Clauses seven and eight of the law were invoked as Dier's \"hand/arm was above/beyond his shoulder level.\"\nCallum Wilson scored his penalty to rescue an unlikely point for Newcastle. However, with frustrations from all quarters already high, the outcry over the decision to punish Dier caused the Premier League to roll back its change and apply a far more liberal interpretation of handball inside the penalty area.\nThe IFAB then tweaked the law the following March, some six months later. The IFAB's new incarnation of the rule dictated that handballs would only be given when the arm is completely away for the body and could not be justifiable by the way the player is moving, for instance jumping like Dier was in order for a foul to be given -- which is actually remarkably similar to the way the law worked before they changed it in the first place.\nIn a truly baffling turn of events, Manchester United strayed even beyond the constraints of \"Fergie Time\" to score their late winner against Brighton in the Premier League back in September 2020.\nThe game looked to be over and done when Solly March scored a 95th-minute equaliser for the Seagulls to make the score 2-2 at the Amex Stadium. However, there was still time for one last twist when United were awarded a penalty AFTER the full-time whistle had sounded. Confusion reigned as referee Chris Kavanagh blew for full-time following a late United corner, only for VAR to ask the official to review a replay of the action in the box. In doing so, Kavanagh noticed an unfortunate handball from Brighton striker Neal Maupay and awarded a penalty to United.\nBruno Fernandes kept his composure to score from the spot and snatch a ludicrous, unprecedented victory for United in the 10th minute of added time of a match that had already been ended once.\nA prime example of VAR being applied too fastidiously came during a game between Crystal Palace and Leeds at Selhurst Park in November 2020. In fine form at the time, Patrick Bamford appeared to have found the net for Leeds once again when he broke the Palace line to score an equaliser for his side with 17 minutes played.\nPatrick Bramford offside because of the change in the handball law. Because you can now pay the ball with the top part of your arm the outstretched arm played him offside. This was onside last season to the armpit. #CRYLEE pic.twitter.com/EezUHdxIYQ\nHowever, the goal was ruled out when VAR deemed Bamford had been offside in the build-up because the striker pointed where he wanted the ball played despite the rest of his body being onside at the time the pass was played. Strictly speaking the decision was correct to the letter of the law as Bamford had pointed using a portion of his arm that he could legally score a goal with, but still...\nPalace went on to win the game 4-1.\n😯 𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗥𝗘𝗜́𝗕𝗟𝗘: hinchas de Gremio invadieron el campo de juego y destrozaron la cabina del VAR💥 Fue después de perder por 3-1 contra Palmeiras por el Brasileirao: el equipo está 19° y en zona de descenso pic.twitter.com/IWaNA4YCal\nLanguishing near the bottom of the table and threatened by relegation, Gremio fans thought their team had hauled their way back into a game against Palmeiras in October 2021 when a potentially crucial equaliser made it 2-2. The swell of optimism quickly gave way to despair when a VAR review disallowed the goal and Gremio went on to slump to a 3-1 defeat in front of their own supporters.\nIt all proved too much for some fans, who decided to rush on to the pitch and take out their frustrations on the technical equipment that had so harshly robbed them.\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Brazil goalkeeper Alisson became the first player to be shown two red cards in the same game and still complete the full match after being spared twice by the VAR. The Liverpool shot-stopper was shown his first red card for a high boot in the 25th minute and then another in stoppage time for knocking striker Ayrton Preciado to the ground while attempting to punch the ball clear.\nHowever, both decisions were overturned after the referee consulted VAR, thus allowing Alisson to finish the game despite being \"sent off\" twice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he was more than happy to sing the praises of the video replay system.\n\"I think this was the first time this has happened in the history of football,\" Alisson said after the match. \"I think that I acted properly in the moves and I think my teammates helped me a lot, they were incisive in their complaints to the referee. This shows once again the importance of using VAR in football. I am happy with the VAR, if it wasn't for the VAR we'd have been punished unfairly.\"\nTempers flared in Serie A last month when mid-table Torino played host to title-chasing Inter Milan at the Stadio Olimpico in Piedmont. Without a win in eight games, the home side defied expectations when Brazilian defender Bremer propelled them in front with an early opener after just 12 minutes. The Granata then carved out a good chance to put themselves further ahead when forward Andrea Belotti found himself clean through on goal only to be upended by the outstretched limb of Inter centre-back Andrea Ranocchia inside the penalty area.\nUnderstandably, Torino appealed in unison only for referee Marco Guida to instruct Belotti to get to his feet. Then, following a brief consultation with VAR official Davide Massa via his headset, Guida was content to let play continue without so much as a pitchside review. In the meanwhile, replays had revealed that Ranocchia had indeed clearly knocked the goal-bound Belotti off his feet before then playing the ball. The game finished 1-1 thanks to a dramatic 93rd-minute equaliser for Inter scored by Alexis Sanchez which, naturally, didn't do anything to calm the incandescent ire of Torino coach Ivan Juric.\n\"It was a clear penalty and nobody understands why it wasn't awarded. I am sure they will try to explain it, but they can't,\" Juric fumed after the final whistle. \"It completely ruined the game, as we would've been 2-0 up.\"\nThe reaction was as we get in the PL.Torino coach: \"It's the latest situation of many when we were penalised. This one is completely inexplicable. It was a clear penalty and nobody understands why it wasn't awarded. I am sure they will try to explain it, but they can't.\" pic.twitter.com/TlK2GhXSz3\nThe Italian press were equally flabbergasted with Tuttosport even awarding referee Guida 0/10 for his performance and branding the turn of events in Turin as a \"scandal.\" Such was the controversy surrounding the errant penalty decision that Serie A themselves stepped in and attempted to diffuse the situation by allowing the Italian Referees' Association (AIA) to release the audio log of the chat between Guida and his VAR official, Massa. \"Ball! Ball! Yes, he got the ball, carry on,\" was the message delivered directly into the ear of the referee.\nThe AIA then proceeded to lay blame squarely at Massa's feet for making what they called a \"serious error,\" with refereeing designator Gianluca Rocchi stating that Massa \"should have looked more carefully at the footage\" before advising Guida to allow play to continue.\nAmid calls for Guida to be banned and/or dropped as a Serie A ref altogether over the incident, Rocchi made sure to add that the AIA wouldn't be prepared to \"lose such a good referee over [the error].\" Still, neither Guida nor Massa have been assigned to officiate a domestic match since the Torino-Inter VAR farce as the fallout continues to simmer away.\nESPN's Dale Johnson contributed to this report"}

{"title": "MMA storylines to watch for the rest of 2023: Rematches galore, vacant titles aplenty", "date": "2023-10-02 15:32:04", "text": "The final quarter of the year is upon us. Things have been hectic -- and newsworthy -- in MMA in 2023.\nFrom a business perspective, the UFC has merged with WWE to form the publicly traded company TKO, under Endeavor. In the cage, UFC titles have been veritable hot potatoes. There have been 10 title changes in the promotion this year, if you include fighters vacating belts because of retirement or injury.\nThe UFC has three more pay-per-view cards before the year ends, and at least five titles will be on the line. Bellator 300 is a few days away, on Saturday in San Diego, with four title fights. PFL still has to decide its entire slate of 2023 championships in November.\nWhat should fans watch over the next three months before the ball drops, sending us into 2024? ESPN MMA insiders Marc Raimondi, Brett Okamoto, Jeff Wagenheim, Andres Waters and Myron Medcalf glance at the top storylines for the rest of the year.\nTom Aspinall finishes Marcin Tybura within the first 90 seconds of the first round of the main event.\nThe UFC 295 main event on Nov. 11 is one of the biggest heavyweight title fights ever. In terms of pure achievements, it's the biggest. Jon Jones is the longtime former UFC light heavyweight champion and a man who is unbeaten in 18 straight fights. Dial that back even more: Jones has never truly been beaten -- his only loss came via questionable disqualification. Stipe Miocic, the challenger in New York, is a two-time former UFC heavyweight champion with a record four total title defenses. His three straight title defenses are also a UFC heavyweight record.\nAs if that isn't significant enough -- the light heavyweight GOAT against the heavyweight GOAT -- what happens after the fight is completely in question. Miocic is 41 years old and a full-time firefighter, and this will be his first fight since March 2021. There's a solid chance that, win or lose, Miocic will retire after UFC 295. Miocic told me in an interview last week that it was a possibility, but only because he's thought about retirement after every one of his fights, going back to his first UFC bout. We'll see.\nMeanwhile, Jones has said on several occasions that this could be it for him. Whether that's a negotiating ploy is up for debate. But Jones is 36 years old. He won his first UFC title when he was 23, the youngest to do it. There is nothing Jones has accomplished. His legacy as the greatest MMA fighter is all but set. Even beating Miocic would just be gravy -- another on a list of Jones accomplishments that could barely fit on one of those lengthy drugstore receipts.\nSo, what would heavyweight look like without Jones and Miocic? The two names that immediately come to mind are Tom Aspinall and Sergei Pavlovich. The former is a well-rounded Brit who can finish a fight anywhere. Aspinall is on the verge of being a big star in the United Kingdom and beyond. The latter is a hard-hitting Russian, a modern-day Drago with size and enormous power. Aspinall and Pavlovich seem to be on a collision course, regardless of the result of UFC 295. Whether that's a title eliminator or a flat-out title fight will be determined on Nov. 11. The heavyweight division will be in good hands with them, but it would be cool to see one get a shot at a Jones or Miocic in a potential passing-the-torch fight.\nI'm curious how the UFC handles these potential rematches. Rematches can be good for the sport and draw a lot of attention. Any time you have a rematch, you have a built-in storyline. But how many will the UFC sign up for? It can't be a year of rematches.\nAnd if you look at each division, it's rematches galore right now. Alexa Grasso vs. Valentina Shevchenko, trilogy. Sean Strickland vs. Israel Adesanya, rematch. Islam Makhachev vs. Charles Oliveira, rematch. Alexander Volkanovski vs. just about any featherweight after Ilia Topuria, rematch. Volkanovski vs. Makhachev, rematch. Sean O'Malley vs. Marlon Vera, rematch. Alexandre Pantoja vs. Brandon Royval, rematch. Pantoja vs. Brandon Moreno, tetralogy.\nThere are some great fights in there, for sure. But does the sport need a year in which nearly half of the major UFC pay-per-view events are matchups we've already seen? Depending on what happens in some of these divisions, we could be looking at more potential rematch situations. Leon Edwards vs. Kamaru Usman 3? Colby Covington vs. Usman 3? Volkanovski vs. Holloway 4? As Dana White likes to say, we'll see how things play out -- but I could see a scenario in which we are debating the merit of plenty of rematches during the next 12 months.\nEarlier this year, Bellator announced that it would be launching a men's flyweight division with former bantamweight champion Kyoji Horiguchi taking on Rizin's Makoto Takahashi for the new title at Bellator MMA vs. Rizin 2 on July 29. But that didn't go as planned -- just seconds into the match, an accidental eye poke by Horiguchi forced the fight to be ruled a no contest, leaving Bellator without a champion for its new division on its inaugural night.\nThere are plenty of questions surrounding the division, but two questions are the most important. The first is obvious: Will there be a rematch for the 125-pound title? Since that fight, the promotion hasn't announced any plans to run it back. Second, and most importantly, who's on the men's flyweight roster? Despite having a fight for the title, Bellator has yet to say anything regarding the fighters it has picked up to fill out this division. It's not an ideal way to introduce a new weight class. Hopefully, we can get some answers sooner rather than later.\nAmanda Nunes leaves her belts and gloves in the Octagon after announcing her retirement from fighting at UFC 289.\nThe UFC women's featherweight and bantamweight divisions have been without a champion ever since Amanda Nunes retired at UFC 289 in June. A month later, Jamahal Hill announced he was vacating the light heavyweight title after rupturing his Achilles tendon. So now 25% of the weight classes in the sport's leading promotion have vacancies at the top.\nThe vacancies themselves are not what's concerning. Retirements and, sadly, career-interrupting injuries happen. What matters here is the UFC's urgency -- or lack of urgency -- in filling those essential positions.\nThe bean counters at the UFC no doubt are more concerned with sorting out the Conor McGregor soap opera, because a \"Notorious\" return would get a standing ovation from TKO stockholders. But fans deserve better. As fun as it used to be to watch McGregor fight, hasn't the circus surrounding him grown tiresome? Every time McGregor rolls into town, it distracts the sport from what matters: the quest to be the best.\nThe UFC is working on it at light heavyweight. Jiří Procházka and Alex Pereira will tangle for the belt at UFC 295 in a tantalizing clash of former champions -- Procházka at light heavy, Pereira at middleweight -- who are standup standouts of very different styles. There's nothing on the books, however, for reestablishing supremacy at women's bantamweight and featherweight.\nLet's get those divisions topped before the end of the year. There's no need to wait for a matchup as brilliant as Procházka vs. Pereira to emerge. The next Amanda Nunes is not out there. But the UFC's 135- and 145-pound women need someone to chase, and fans deserve more shiny belts to follow.\nAlexa Grasso retains her flyweight title after a split draw with former flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\nFor years, Shevchenko owned the women's flyweight division. At 125 pounds, she had been the mayor, the sheriff and the deputy, as she defended her belt seven times in a row. Then she faced Grasso, the current champion who upset Shevchenko earlier this year and then kept the belt via a controversial draw last month. Grasso's emergence has not only changed the division, but the titleholder and her colleagues could also change the UFC.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Passan predicts the MLB playoffs »\n• Connelly's September CFB truths »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nThe 125-pound women's landscape is no longer dominated by one fighter. Grasso and Shevchenko will eventually meet a third time -- once Shevchenko heals from a hand injury -- but she's not the only threat to Grasso's throne. Erin Blanchfield hasn't lost since February 2019. The jiu-jitsu specialist has four submissions in that run. Who wants to fight her? Manon Fiorot toyed with Rose Namajunas, the former strawweight champ, when they met in September. Fiorot has won her last 11 fights. Who wants to fight her? And a Maycee Barber-Grasso rematch -- Grasso beat Barber via unanimous decision in 2021, Barber's most recent loss -- also makes sense. Plus, Jessica Andrade is always a handful at 115 or 125 pounds.\nThere are enough fights to turn 125 pounds into the UFC's most competitive and fascinating division in the years ahead, especially with the possibility of a few 115-pound fighters moving up. There has always been talk about Zhang Weili potentially chasing a second belt at 125 pounds. But the return of Tatiana Suarez -- the undefeated fighter who beat Andrade at 115 pounds in August, her second bout after a four-year layoff -- makes things interesting for two divisions. Suarez has fought at 125 pounds, and she's a serious contender in both weight classes. Who wants to fight her?\nAnd that's the beauty of the UFC. For years, we just wondered whom Shevchenko would dismiss next. Now, the months and years ahead could feature a gauntlet in the women's flyweight division that boosts the entire UFC."}
{"title": "Down but not out: Jermell Charlo couldn't top Canelo Alvarez, but still has meaningful fights ahead", "date": "2023-10-02 19:25:12", "text": "Canelo Alvarez handles business with another big-time win, this time over challenger Jermell Charlo in Las Vegas. (1:47)\nLAS VEGAS -- Jermell Charlo was ringside at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in November 2021 when Canelo Alvarez faced Caleb Plant for the undisputed super middleweight championship.\nDuring the fight -- which Canelo won via 11th-round TKO -- Charlo turned to his twin brother, Jermall, and said: \"I can beat Canelo.\"\nTurns out, it's one thing to say it. It's quite another to actually do it.\nCharlo (35-2-1, 19 KOs) jumped two weight classes on Saturday in an attempt to dethrone boxing's top star, but he was no match. Alvarez won virtually every second of the fight, scored a seventh-round knockdown and earned a unanimous-decision victory to retain his four titles at 168 pounds.\nThere's no shame, of course, in losing to an all-time great like Canelo. Charlo was nearly a 4-1 underdog to upset Alvarez for many reasons.\nCharlo struggled in a loss to Tony Harrison in 2018 and a draw with Brian Castano in 2021, quality boxers who are levels below Alvarez. Charlo finished both Harrison (2019) and Castano (2022) inside the distance in rematches, which spoke well of his ability to make adjustments. But there didn't seem to be a Plan B on Saturday and he oddly seemed content after the bout to have lasted until the final bell.\n\"I'm proud of myself,\" said Charlo, who fights out of Houston. \"He didn't knock me out; he knocked all the other guys out.\"\nCharlo predicted the fight would last the 12-round distance and apparently found a moral victory in not being another Alvarez KO victim. It's a strange approach for one of the sport's most outspoken fighters.\nAfter the fight, Alvarez felt that Charlo wasn't trying to win the fight.\n\"I think that happens with a lot of fighters,\" Alvarez said. \"That's not on my mind, to survive that way. So then I did my job. I think he never [did] something to win.\"\nAs Alvarez piled up rounds, trainer Derrick James implored Charlo to be more aggressive down the stretch. But Charlo never pushed, never landed a punch of consequence and never threatened to be competitive let alone win the fight.\n\"My head is held high,\" said Charlo, who acknowledged he could have been more aggressive. \"I am proud of myself.\"\nFollowing Charlo's lackluster performance on Saturday, pound-for-pound king Terence Crawford, who was ringside to watch the fight, had some choice words for his potential future opponent.\n\"You went out sad,\" Crawford immediately posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, while tagging Charlo. \"Didn't even try to win, all you did was try to survive. You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\"I'm over Charlo, he's no longer on my hit list,\" Crawford added. \"He went out there and laid down.\"\nCharlo said \"Crawford could be on the radar,\" but it appears the feeling is no longer mutual. And if the matchup did materialize, it certainly lost a lot of luster.\nBut all is not lost for Charlo. He didn't seem to take much damage outside of the seventh-round knockdown courtesy of a Canelo overhand right and should be an improved fighter going forward after sharing the ring for 12 rounds with Alvarez.\nCharlo still has other meaningful fights in his future. After all, he remains the top guy at 154 pounds. Charlo said he only rehydrated to around 172, 173 pounds on fight night; boxers routinely gain 10-15 pounds overnight.\n\"I'm going back down to 154 so that's gonna be major,\" Charlo said. \"I can do it. I can make the weight easy.... I'm used to moving around much lighter.\"\nHowever, he's no longer the undisputed junior middleweight champion. Charlo still holds the WBA, WBC and IBF titles. But once the bell rang on Saturday, the WBO stripped Charlo and elevated Australian star Tim Tszyu from interim champion to full champion.\n\"Tim Tszyu is the [WBO junior middleweight] champion,\" WBO president Francisco \"Paco\" Valcarcel told ESPN on Monday. \"[The fight between] Tim Tszyu with [Brian] Mendoza is for the title. [Jermell] Charlo was notified when we posted the resolution online [August 3].\"\nThat resolution indicated that once Charlo got in the ring to face Canelo, instead of his mandatory challenger, Tim Tszyu, Charlo would be stripped of the belt and Tszyu \"will be automatically elevated from interim champion to full champion status.\"\n\"I would like to talk with somebody from the WBO and see what kind of issues they can resolve...,\" Charlo said. \"I gotta just continue to roll with the punches. Jermell Charlo never gets the fair end of the stick. I gotta go and fight for mine....\n\"[The WBO] must really got a relationship with the people in Australia. And that's okay with me. I just gotta continue to be a champion and continue to fight, and barnone put my heart on the line every time I get in there.\"\nOne of the opportunities to put that performance in the past will be, perhaps, a rescheduled showdown with Tszyu, who's impressed with his power and improved attack in recent fights.\nTszyu, 28, will make the first defense of his WBO title on Oct. 14 in Sydney against Brian Mendoza. The son of Hall of Famer Kostya Tszyu, Tim Tszyu was set to fight Charlo in January before Charlo broke his left hand in two places during a sparring session just a month before the scheduled bout.\nThis was his first fight since his hand was placed in a cast in January, and it was also his first time fighting a truly elite opponent. He had never fought above 154 pounds and despite being taller than Canelo, was the naturally smaller man.\nAlvarez himself said he wasn't 100% confident in his surgically repaired left wrist when he fought John Ryder in May. So it's unfair to believe that Charlo was at his best on Saturday.\nMost of all, perhaps, Charlo was contending with serious ring rust -- 16 months. His most-recent fight was in May 2022, an impressive 10th-round KO of Castano. Beginning with 2020, Charlo has fought only once a year. During that same span, Alvarez competed seven times.\nThree top fighters recently suffered defeats after long layoffs.

The club was clearly aware of their bumbling ways because they cleaned house in 2021. Chris Albright came over to head up soccer operations and they've barely made a wrong move since.\nWhether it's bringing in players from abroad, plucking players from elsewhere in the league, developing those on the roster or deploying their squad in a smart, cohesive system, Cincy have emerged as the class of MLS. Everyone, from Albright, down to manager Pat Noonan, to presumptive league MVP Luciano Acosta, has been nothing short of outstanding and on Saturday they won the Supporters' Shield to show for all their terrific work.\nTwo years ago, Cincy were holding the Wooden Spoon after losing 12 straight to end the season. Now, they are the class of the league and have the first piece of silverware for their trophy case. But what about the 28 teams behind them? Let's rank 'em.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nPrevious ranking: 1\nCincy's superpower is not that they blow teams out of the water. It's that week in, week out, they put together competent performances and rack up points with their consistency. So was it ideal that they got locked into a pretty close game with Toronto? No, but Cincy were the better team and won like they have so often this season. And it is why they are unquestionably deserving Supporters' Shield winners.\nTHE SHIELD IS OURS! pic.twitter.com/84RE1OpkZ4\nPrevious ranking: 2\nThe Crew would have celebrated an impressive win over Philly, but Andre Blake would not give. Those two points lost could be the difference between home-field advantage and not come playoff time.\nPrevious ranking: 4\nThe last time Orlando lost at home was way back on April 22, so it's no surprise they cruised past Montréal at Exploria Stadium. They could clinch that awfully effective home-field advantage for the playoffs as soon as next week.\nPrevious ranking: 3\nThe Union continue to display their depth and adaptiveness. Draws against Dallas and Columbus under heavy rotation were impressive, but they also failed to display the truly excellent top form that has been fleeting this season. If they're going to upend the teams above them in a stacked East, they need to find that extra gear.\nPrevious ranking: 7\nKings of Missouri? Check. Kings of the West? Check. It was a dream week for City, who beat SKC to clinch the top seed in the West, continuing an expansion season beyond anyone's wildest dreams.\nPrevious ranking: 5\nThe return of Sam Surridge was supposed to jumpstart the Nashville attack, but they could barely get him the ball in a scoreless draw with Seattle. The Coyotes have four more chances to put their newly healthy pieces together ahead of the playoffs when they will need a better attack if they want a chance to make a run in a very strong conference. The talent is certainly there, it's just about finding the right form before time runs out.\nPrevious ranking: 6\nLosing the Campeones Cup on penalties was rough, but having Chicho Arango come back to LA in an RSL kit and beat you? That not only stings, but it has them in real danger of losing home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.\nPrevious ranking: 8\nThe Five Stripes got to take the week off and watch teams around them drop points. A leap into the top four of the East and an extra game or two in Atlanta is still in play.\nPrevious ranking: 10\nIt's hardly novel to say that the Sounders desperately need Raúl Ruidíaz at his best to make some hay in the West. That was clear once more after the Peruvian was ruled out of their 0-0 draw with Nashville, but there's still a few weeks left for the 33-year-old to get right for one last playoff run.\nPrevious ranking: 14\nChicho Arango's game-winner in his return to LAFC was the fun story from the big RSL win, but it was Rubio Rubin who made the goal happen with his gorgeous cross. Pablo Mastroeni's team continues to get the job done away from home.\nPrevious ranking: 10\nInter drew NYCFC to make it three results from four matches without Lionel Messi (and they won another when he played sparingly) in a massive statement to those who claim this team is nothing without the Argentine. Unfortunately, their playoff odds keep growing longer so we may have to wait until next season to see the new Inter Miami get a real crack at the league.\nPrevious ranking: 11\nA quick glance at the score would lead you to believe that the Dynamo went a little too hard after winning the U.S. Open Cup and were a little flat against Dallas, but Houston played well and were unlucky not to beat their Texas rivals. Ben Olsen's team is still trending up at the right time.\nPrevious ranking: 13\nThe Revs fans showed up big time to the tune of 37,701 and the team repaid them with a win over Charlotte. Exactly how good this team is now, and will be in the playoffs, remains to be seen after such a volatile summer, but they still own the third seed in the East.\nPrevious ranking: 12\nThe Caps' midweek draw in Colorado doesn't look great at face, but it capped off a seven-match road trip with 11 points so it wasn't too bad. Losing two leads and taking just a point from D.C. at home is tougher to spin as a positive, especially with St. Louis, LAFC and Seattle on tap to close out the season.\nPrevious ranking: 15\nFCD did well to take results from Vancouver and Houston, but after those pair of draws they are now asking themselves an eternal soccer question: is it impressive that a team is managing to so regularly avoid defeat, or concerning that they are struggling to win? Dallas have now lost just one of their last nine, but have also only won twice in that span.\nPrevious ranking: 16\nNot only are the Loons not getting the results they need, but they also don't seem to have the juice you'd expect from a team playing for their season. They took a lead on San Jose but never looked like they had more in the tank and had to settle for a draw that kept them below the playoff line. That's not going to cut it for a team that should have the pieces to make a deep playoff run.\nPrevious ranking: 19\nThe Timbers probably left LA disappointed to have only managed a draw with the Galaxy, but their real concern will be with Cristhian Paredes, who went down injured. How far they can go in the playoffs, and whether they can even hang on to a postseason place, may depend on his prognosis.\nPrevious ranking: 18\nThe Quakes have struggled away from the Bay this season so coming from behind to snag a point in Minnesota? They'll take it. The question now is whether they can secure a home playoff game or two because while this team may be flawed, they are a problem at PayPal Park.\nPrevious ranking: 20\nIt's a shame that D.C. needed three points to get above the playoff line because going to Vancouver and coming from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw is a really good result, but it doesn't feel as good when they're looking up at the playoff places.\nPrevious ranking: 17\nIt's bad enough that Sporting are suffering their second straight difficult season as the old guard struggles to catch up with the rest of the league, but doing so while a new rival emerges? That's diabolical, but it's impossible to describe it any other way after SKC got smoked by St. Louis to ensure their rivals would capture the top seed in the West, while they creeped ever closer to a second straight season out of the playoffs.\nPrevious ranking: 21\nThe Galaxy played another wild one and their ability to continue fighting in a season that seemed so lost remains admirable, but draws aren't enough if they want to make the playoffs. They needed full points against Portland.\nHerculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nPrevious ranking: 24\nNYCFC was so close to victory, but a Miami goal five minutes into stoppage time made them settle for a single point. That point is crucial because it's what separates the Pigeons from being out of a playoff place, but it also makes those two late points dropped so gut-wrenching.\nPrevious ranking: 27\nThe Fire's seven-match winless streak is over after Georgios Koutsias beat RBNY. They're out of the playoffs right now only on a tiebreaker, so they've been handed a gift of still being in the postseason fight. With three teams also in the fight, Miami, Charlotte and NYCFC, making up their final three matches, the Fire control their own destiny. It's now or never.\nPrevious ranking: 22\nThe Crown is technically still in the playoff race, but only barely after losing to New England and with just one win in their last 15 it's hard to see how they make a run in their last four.\nPrevious ranking: 22\nMontréal's best weapon right now is all the teams below them dropping points because they lost again, this time in Orlando, but still managed to hold into ninth place in the East. They close out the season with Houston, Portland and Columbus, so it's time to pick things up because there's not an easy point in that finish.\nPrevious ranking: 28\nThe Rapids drew Vancouver and beat Austin, 2-1, to keep their good run of form going under Chris Little. It's too bad that it's all coming too late because the only thing left for Colorado to play for this season is Little getting the job permanently.\nPrevious ranking: 23\nIt will probably take three wins from their last three for Austin to make the playoffs. Are you taking that bet on a team that just lost to Colorado and hasn't won since July 15?\nPrevious ranking: 26\nThe Red Bulls needed three points against the Fire and instead slumped to a loss with 10 men. It's a real uphill battle to the postseason now with Cincy and Nashville making up two of their last three contests.\nPrevious ranking: 29\nWatching Cincy clinch the Supporters' Shield on their turf might be the most memorable moment of Toronto's season."}
{"title": "Euro women's weekend review: WSL returns in style, Man United win late, Lyon down PSG", "date": "2023-10-02 20:28:19", "text": "Nedum Onuoha reacts to Arsenal breaking the WSL attendance record in their clash with Liverpool in the opening weekend of the competition. (1:52)\nAfter a summer off for good behaviour, the Women's Super League (WSL) returned on Sunday with an entertaining a day filled with goals, cards and debuts. These are the key talking points from the WSL weekend, along with some highlights from European action.\nWith WSL referees encouraged to mirror the men's game and clamp down on things like dissent and time-wasting, we saw an influx in cautions over the weekend, with an increased willingness from officials to go to their pockets for the type of fouls that have historically been overlooked in the women's game.\nIndeed, across the six games, 17 yellow cards were handed out for a variety of offences including dissent, with Aston Villa's Lucy Parker the first player to be booked this season in a match that saw six yellow cards in total issued by ref Rebecca Welch. It was a notable day in WSL that also saw two straight red cards -- for Aston Villa's Kirsty Hanson and Manchester City's Leila Ouahabi -- which hasn't happened in the league for over a decade.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nAs well as the increase in cautions, just as there was at the Women's World Cup this summer, there was ample time added on at the end of each half following new guidelines for stoppages in play, meaning some teams played well over 100 minutes of football.\nOn the topic of increased added time, particularly at the end of the second half, there was late drama at Villa Park when Manchester United claimed all three points with a stoppage-time winner from Rachel Williams. After Villa's Hanson was dismissed for a high tackle on Hayley Ladd, the hosts took a shock 1-0 lead via Rachel Daly's low shot. But Lucía García had United level within minutes, converting from a corner and setting the scene for Williams' dramatic late header from Nikita Parris' cross.\nThe Red Devils are clearly picking up where they left off from last year with their late, often game-changing, goals. Those heroics were absent for their rivals, however, with Everton (who lost 2-1 at home), Tottenham (who fell 2-1) and Arsenal (1-0 losers) all unable to find similar late goals against Brighton, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively.\nWith almost every WSL team having strengthened over the summer in hopes of bridging some of the gaps and creating a bit more parity, there was a glut of goals across the day's fixtures as well.\nOnly Manchester City (in a 2-0 win at West Ham) and Liverpool (1-0 winners at Arsenal) managed to keep their clean sheets on Sunday afternoon, thanks to the improved attacking across the league. Daly, last season's golden boot winner scored the first WSL of the campaign when she got the better of Man United keeper Mary Earps. And both Spurs and Leicester -- two teams who struggled for goals last campaign -- would have been relieved to see their new recruits finding the back of the net bag on what was, a memorable day for new signings.\nMartha Thomas scored for Tottenham in a losing effort, while Jill Roord opened the scoring for Man City in their win, but Foxes' boss Willie Kirk will probably be happiest about his new players: three of his summer recruits, Aimee Palmer, Lena Petermann and Jutta Rantala scored all the goals on their Leicester City debuts in a 4-2 win at Bristol City.\nOn the topic of new faces, it was a Sunday to remember as so many of the players signed over the summer came up big for their new clubs.\nThe tone was set in the first game of the afternoon. Geyse picked up where she left off at Barcelona by straight balling out for Manchester United, running at defences and causing panic among Villa defenders who were struggling to contain her. But it wasn't just the Brazilian international who starred at Villa Park: the Villanesses' new No.1, Dutch international Daphne van Domselaar, made a string of eye-catching saves to keep the visitors frustrated until their late breakthrough.\nIn the West Country, Rantala stole the show for the Foxes after coming on at half-time for the visitors. The Finnish international was instrumental in Leicester's strong second-half showing, scoring four minutes after the restart and adding a second seven minutes from time among a flurry of strong debuts across both teams.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here. Stream top leagues, tournaments and teams.\nSign up for ESPN+\nSATURDAY, OCT. 7 (all times ET)\n• Sunderland vs. Middlesbrough (7 a.m.)\n• RB Leipzig vs. Vfl Bochum (9 a.m.)\n• Dortmund vs. Union Berlin (9 a.m.)\n• Real Madrid vs. Osasuna (9 a.m.)\n• Leeds United vs. Bristol City (10 a.m.)\n• Mallorca vs. Valencia (12 p.m.)\nSATURDAY, OCT. 8 (all times ET)\n• Ajax vs. AZ (8 a.m.)\n• Atletico Madrid vs. Real Sociedad (10 a.m.)\n• Bayern Munich vs. Freiburg (11 a.m.)\n• Granada vs. Barcelona (3 p.m.)\nAt Stamford Bridge, Mia Fishel starred for hosts Chelsea and Thomas impressed for the visitors; both scored well-taken goals as the Blues ran out 2-1 winners. However, it wasn't just about the goalscorers, as Spurs winger Olga Ahtinen and Chelsea midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken turned in strong WSL debuts as well.\nIt was a similar story in North London, where Liverpool's savvy showing in a 1-0 win was punctuated with key performances from newcomers Miri Taylor (who grabbed the game's only goal) and Austrian midfielder Marie Höbinger, though Arsenal's summer signings were left looking to the next game to impress. The bigger delight, though, was the record WSL crowd in attendance for the Gunners' opener, as 54,115 turned up for Sunday's clash, only for the visitors to take the three points.\nAcross London, Roord put in a vintage performance for Manchester City on her return to the Super League, scoring City's second in a dominant performance against the Irons.\nLikely to be key to the Seagulls in their quest for a top-half finish, Brighton's debuting duo of Vicky Losada and Pauline Bremer both impressed, even if the plaudits went to regulars Elisabeth Terland and Katie Robinson.\nUsually left for later in the first cycle of fixtures, champions Lyon had their first clash with familiar foes, Paris Saint-Germain, on Sunday evening. Having handed a debut to new star striker Tabitha Chawinga, the Parisiennes enjoyed their spell of chances early in the game before Lyon found a gear with which to exploit their opponents, running out 1-0 winners thanks to Eugénie Le Sommer's 20th-minute strike.\nIn Germany, Wolfsburg were put through their paces at the Waldstadion, twice having to come from behind against Eintracht before stamping their dominance on the match thanks in no small part to stunning strikes from Lena Oberdorf and Joelle Wedemeyer. The 4-2 win leaves Wolfsburg in an advantageous position early in the season after champions Bayern had dropped points in their first outing, a 2-2 result vs. Freiburg.\nMeanwhile, in Liga F, Spanish juggernauts Barcelona were put through their paces against a resilient Huelva team, which affirmed the closing margins across the women's football landscape. It took a 92nd minute own goal from Ana Carol to secure Barca's win, though an even later finish by Laia Ballesté made things a little nervous."}

Blaney in his Ford for Team Penske and Harvick in a Ford for Stewart-Haas Racing finished essentially in a drag race with both drivers refusing to lift as a crash broke out behind them.\n\"I've won it by more than I have the last couple years. That one might have been by 4 feet, the others were by 2 but you just don't know,\" said Blaney, a three-time winner at Talladega. \"You just kind of drag race a line and hope you get help.\"\nBlaney joined William Byron as the two drivers locked into the round of eight. The field of 12 will be pared next Sunday to eight following the race on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nBlaney boss Roger Penske praised the strategy of the Ford camp to work together to ensure a Ford victory as the Chevrolets from Hendrick Motorsports were making a quick challenge.\n\"For Harvick, who it was his last race here, working like he did with Ryan, it was amazing to see that,\" said Penske. \"The Hendrick freight train was coming and we all stayed together, that was the call that Ford had earlier in the day when we talked. It was just perfect execution.\"\nFord has won 10 playoff races at Talladega, most at any track, and Team Penske has won 10 of the last 18 races at the 2.66-mile Alabama oval.\nBlaney, winner of the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte in May, now has multiple wins in a season for the second time in his career. But he's got a lopsided stat this season in that he has only five top-five finishes, but two wins.\n\"It was a pretty wild restart, let alone the last couple of laps, losing momentum and getting it back, just getting clear to the bottom to get to the front row and drag race it out with Kevin,\" said Blaney. \"To win here three times at Talladega is super cool.\"\nHarvick finished second as his winless streak stretched to 43 races dating back to last season. NASCAR said nearly two hours after the race that his Ford had been disqualified because the fasteners on his windshield were not secure.\nThe Harvick disqualification dropped him to last in the field. Byron in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports moved up to second and Denny Hamlin, who rallied from a lap down, moved up to third in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing.\nHamlin led three laps during the second stage but was flagged for speeding on pit road -- a troubling habit of the three-time Daytona 500 winner considered the best driver to never win a Cup championship -- and the penalty contributed to him falling a lap off the pace. It was Hamlin's fourth speeding penalty of the season and it took him most of the race to earn his position back on the lead lap and then drove through the field to secure his finish.\n\"Not how we drew it up, but a dub is a dub and that was a dub in our book -- it's as close as it gets to it,\" Hamlin said. \"A top-five is a long way from where we were with about 15 laps to go.\"\nCorey LaJoie, who is not in the playoffs, moved up to fourth in a Chevrolet for Spire Motorsports. Blaney teammate Austin Cindric moved to fifth and was followed by Justin Haley of Kaulig Racing in a Chevrolet, defending race winner Chase Elliott for Hendrick, and the Fords of Ryan Preece and Riley Herbst. Daniel Suarez moved up to 10th. None of the drivers who finished fourth through 10th are in the playoffs.\nThe race had 70 lead changes among 24 drivers and was fairly clean. Ross Chastain was in an early crash that caused last year's championship runner-up to finish last. Brad Keselowski was in a later crash with 28 laps to go that ended the race for him, caused damage to Talladega's outer wall and stopped all action under a red flag.\nPLAYOFF PICTURE\nEven though he crashed and finished 32nd, Keselowski remained two points above the cutline headed to Charlotte's elimination race.\nThe four drivers in jeopardy of elimination are Tyler Reddick of 23XI Racing, Chastain of Trackhouse Racing, Bubba Wallace of 23XI and Kyle Busch of Richard Childress Racing. Busch must win to advance.\nWallace had a lengthy post-race chat with 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan on pit road following his 23rd-place finish. Jordan appeared to be encouraging him, at one point placing his hand on the back of Wallace's neck and then shoulder, then pulling him in for a hug.\nCHASTAIN CRASHES OUT\nChastain, who finished second to Joey Logano last year in the championship race, finished one spot ahead of Harvick after a collision with fellow title contenders Busch and Christopher Bell on the final lap of the first stage.\nChastain entered Talladega, the middle race of the round of 12, ranked sixth in the Cup standings and 12 points above the cutline. His last-place finish dropped him below the cutline and forced him into a high-pressure situation next week on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nChastain has struggled in his four previous starts on Charlotte's hybrid road course/oval track. His best finish is 22nd.\n\"Left and right,\" he said when asked how he expects next week to go. \"I'm living my dream, so whatever our team brings next week, we'll put our best foot forward. As long as I'm getting to drive these rocket ships that Trackhouse brings me, I'm living my dream and we'll keep fighting.\"\nUP NEXT\nNASCAR races next Sunday on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where Bell won last year to avoid playoff elimination."}
{"title": "Six players ready to make a big leap in Year 2", "date": "2023-10-02 21:43:05", "text": "After a stellar rookie season, Trail Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe should see plenty of opportunity in a new-look Portland backcourt. (1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind. With the majority of drafted players entering the NBA in their late teens or very early 20s, and many of those players international, the development process from prospect to professional can extend beyond a single season. .\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball. As you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}

(2:20)\nWe say it every year -- typically, rookies aren't drafted until the middle to late rounds in fantasy basketball.\nYes, every now and then, there's a hyped up player who sneaks into round three (like this year), but most seasons the top rookie won't go until the fourth or fifth round at the earliest.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThis presents a major opportunity for the savvy fantasy manager, who dedicates the early rounds to setting up the foundation of their team while having a certain rookie or two in mind for the middle and late rounds. Find the right rookies, and this can be a winning formula.\nBut who are the rookies to have this season? And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ½ inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}

Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nConnor Bedard, F, Chicago Blackhawks: First off, a hearty congratulations to every dynasty/keeper league manager blessed with this year's precious No. 1 draft selection. Not only is the pick itself a no-brainer, but the runaway Calder favorite is likely to pay out rich fantasy dividends for years and years to come. Straight out of the gates, we know Bedard is poised to provide a hearty serving of minutes on the Blackhawks' top line and power play alongside veteran Taylor Hall. There's little question of that.\nAll that's left to forecast is whether he scores 60, 80, or near 100 points. My preseason guess is somewhere in the point/game range, at least to start. Hardly matters though; if you have the chance to pick Bedard in dynasty play, you're picking him. Otherwise, he initially presents as a Top-35 fantasy forward in re-draft leagues.\nAdam Fantilli, F, Columbus Blue Jackets: The kid out of Nobleton, Ontario is also supposed to be pretty good. A standout at September's Traverse City prospect tournament, Fantilli appeared NHL-ready in every way, beyond the potting of seven points on 15 shots through two games. Happily launching camp on a top-six line with Patrik Laine (\"yeah, it's going great, obviously, [Laine's] really easy to play with\"), the gifted center is endeavouring to lay a foundation for an outstanding rookie campaign.\nAfter scoring 65 points in 36 games as a freshman with the University of Michigan - and winning the Hobey Baker award - Fantilli should earn regular opportunities to prove he can hang with the grownups. Especially since this Blue Jackets squad is still a year or two away from making serious noise in the East. He's my favorite forward pick in dynasty competition outside of the young fella in Chicago.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever!

Many will argue that, after potting 51 points in 53 games with the AHL Wild in 2022-23, Rossi merits at least a chance to compete between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello, but he'll have to leapfrog Frederick Gaudreau Joel Eriksson Ek, and Ryan Hartman (when healthy again) to get there. A role in the bottom-six doesn't harbor anywhere near the same fantasy promise.\nKeep a close view on where the ninth-overall draft pick (2020), now three years removed from battling COVID-related myocarditis, lines up in camp.\nMatthew Knies, F, Toronto Maple Leafs: Fellow Arizonan Auston Matthews, after training with the young winger this summer, had this to say, \"He's very driven. Physically, he's more than capable of playing all 82 games and being a really good player for us.\"\nToss in a promising gig on the Leafs' second line alongside center John Tavares, plus a spot on the No. 2 power play, and we might have a fresh productive fantasy force in Toronto this season. Knies potted 21 goals and 21 assists in 40 games with the University of Minnesota before collecting five in 10 with his NHL club, including four in seven postseason contests.\nLogan Cooley, F, Arizona Coyotes: Part of the Coyotes' \"present\", as well as their future, according to coach Andre Tourigny, Cooley is already turning heads in his post-Collegiate career (see below). The advantage of playing for a rebuilding club unencumbered by ambitious expectations at present is that he'll earn plenty of minutes and ripe opportunities to do the same all season long. Why not? If not for Fantilli's exceptional showing, Cooley's 60 points as a freshman with the University of Minnesota may have sufficed in winning him the Hobey Baker. Even the most frustrated Coyotes fan can feel legitimately excited about this raw star. Fantasy managers should too.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nMatt Coronato, F, Calgary Flames: Toss the Harvard lad on the right side of Nazem Kadri (again), and let him strut his scoring stuff, is my advice. With new GM Craig Conroy and bench boss Ryan Huska at the helm, the soon-to-turn 21-year-old should earn a fair shake at the chance to fill one of the Flames' handful of vacancies up front.\nA dynamic scoring winger, Coronato has impressed at every level to date, including with the USHL Chicago Steel and in college competition. His eight points in 10 games at the 2023 IIHF men's World Championships this past May more than proves he can keep up with experienced, fully-grown pros. An obvious top-tier selection in dynasty leagues, the 13th overall draft pick (2021) could make a tangible scoring impact as soon as now.\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nLuke Hughes, D, New Jersey Devils: Long after the novelty of watching him compete on the same team as older brother Jack wears off, the youngest Hughes sibling will still be putting up points with regularity. It's only a matter of time before he supplants, or joins Dougie Hamilton, on the Devils' top power play. An immediate must-grab in keeper play, this fourth-overall draft pick (2021) already sports value in all but the shallowest of conventional re-draft fantasy leagues.\nBrandt Clarke, D, Los Angeles Kings: Having enjoyed the privilege of watching this kid compete for the Barrie Colts in person on a handful of occasions, I can assure you he's something special. A future key piece of the Kings' blue line, and top prospect at large, the 20-year-old has accomplished all he can in the OHL, and feels ready to play full-time with the club that drafted him eighth overall in 2021 (ahead of Arizona's Dylan Guenther, Coronato, and Stars' center Wyatt Johnston).\nBeing in the position to learn from one of the game's best in Drew Doughty certainly won't hurt either. While his most explosive fantasy days lie ahead, Clarke still merits monitoring in the here and now. The young defender scored 61 points in only 31 games with the Colts this past season,\nDevon Levi, G, Buffalo Sabres: As discussed in ESPN.com's fantasy goalie preview, I'm all in on Levi's potential to make the Sabres' roster this season. Maybe not right out of camp, but eventually. And once offered a spot on hockey's largest stage, I do expect him to hold his own. Lack of NHL experience aside, the 21-year-old is bright, skilled, disciplined, hardworking, and confident without seeming concerningly arrogant. A bit small, by goalie standards, but so was Henrik Lundqvist and he managed well enough.\nThis kid's all-around vibe has me convinced he's ready to sub in if/when Eric Comrie or Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen falter or fall hurt. Again, now or later. Adding to this already promising fantasy formula is that Buffalo is already good and only getting better.\nJoseph Woll, G, Toronto Maple Leafs: Unlike Levi in Western New York, Toronto's rookie netminder is expected to make his big-league club out of camp. Serving as a pro since 2019, he can't be sent down to the minors without being subjected to waivers, and fat chance Brad Treliving and Co. take that swing.\nSo, unless injured, he's going to play. More pressing to fantasy managers and Leafs' fans alike, on the assumption that Martin Jones only enters the goaltending mix should Ilya Samsonov or Woll fall hurt, is how well and how much. While seven NHL games hardly count as many, the 25-year-old won over a gazillion Toronto fans by posting a 6-1-0 record, 2.16 GAA, and .932 SV% in 2022-23. Dazzling stuff. One of the league's sneakier sleeper picks between the pipes, with a top-quality club in Toronto, Woll could conduct himself as a game-changer for fantasy managers in 2023-24. He just needs to play.\nSee also:\nTyson Foerster, F, Philadelphia Flyers\nLeo Carlsson, F, Anaheim Ducks\nJoel Hofer, G, St. Louis Blues\nReady to play? Sign up for free today!"}
