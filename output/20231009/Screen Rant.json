{"title": "Francis Ford Coppola Reveals His Review Of Martin Scorsese's Killers Of The Flower Moon", "date": "2023-10-09 14:41:01", "text": "The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, a longtime friend of Martin Scorsese, has nothing but kind words to say about Killers of the Flower Moon.\nMartin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon receives praise from fellow legendary director Francis Ford Coppola. A contemporary of Scorsese, Coppola is the director of copious iconic films, including The Conversation, The Godfather trilogy, and Apocalypse Now. Scorsese has since become equally as prolific, and will release his latest 3.5 hour epic, Killers of the Flower Moon, on October 20.\nCoppola sings Killers of the Flower Moon’s praises in a recent post on Instagram. Alongside the trailer for Killers of the Flower Moon, Coppola alerted followers that his “longtime friend” Scorsese “has a new film coming out this month.” Check out his post, below:\nCoppola had nothing but nice things to say about both Scorsese and Killers of the Flower Moon. Of the film, Coppola wrote that Killers of the Flower Moon “delivers on every level.” Coppola even went so far as to call Scorsese “the world’s greatest living filmmaker.”\nAs Coppola mentions, he and Scorsese have been friends for decades. Having long supported each other’s work, Coppola even offered Scorsese the chance to direct The Godfather: Part II, which Scorsese famously turned down. Thus, this Killers of the Flower Moon praise is touching coming from someone so close to Scorsese.\nRelated: Why Killers Of The Flower Moon Took 6 Years For Martin Scorsese To Make\nGiven Coppola’s filmmaking prowess, his Killers of the Flower Moon comments also go a long way in predicting the critical success of the film. Already, Killers of the Flower Moon has set itself apart through its stated portrayal of the Osage tribe. Rather than make the film a white-centric narrative, Scorsese chose to put actress Lily Gladstone, who plays a woman of the Osage tribe, at the heart of Killers of the Flower Moon. Combined with a promising Killers of the Flower Moon trailer, this fact cements the film as one of the most culturally important films to come out of Hollywood this year.\nFurthermore, Killers of the Flower Moon has the opportunity to fill a massive box office voice this fall. As Dune: Part Two’s delayed release date leaves the fall 2023 theatrical scene looking more sparse, Killers of the Flower Moon has the potential to drive up IMAX revenue as audiences look for other options. Thus, Killers of the Flower Moon could become both a box office and critical darling upon its rapidly-approaching October release.\nSource: Francis Ford Coppola / Instagram\n"}
{"title": "What The Cast Of An American Werewolf In London Has Done Since 1981", "date": "2023-10-09 14:40:28", "text": "In 1981, An American Werewolf in London awed audiences with its horrifying and gory premise, but over thirty years later, what is the cast doing now?\nSince its release in 1981, An American Werewolf in London has become a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason, but now that more than thirty years have passed, some viewers may be wondering, what happened to the cast of this iconic film? An American Werewolf in London tells the story of best friends David and Jack who go on a backpacking trip in England that goes horribly wrong when the men are attacked by a wolf. Jack is killed, but David only sustains a few injuries that quickly snowball into something more sinister, as David begins having visions and discovers that he might just be a werewolf.\nAn American Werewolf in London earned much of its success from the unique way in which the popular werewolf movie was tackled. It wasn't just a straight horror, but instead was a scary horror comedy movie. These genres might seem to directly oppose each other, but in actuality, this mix of terrifying and clever made the movie stand-out. Another major aspect of the film that led to its success was its makeup and special effects. The scene in which David first becomes a werewolf is iconic, and arguably, changed special effects in the horror genre forever. These aspects, plus the cast's amazing performances, made for an all around terrific film.\nRelated: 10 Things You Didn't Know About An American Werewolf in London\nThe lead actor of An American Werewolf in London is David Naughton, playing the role of the man-turned-werewolf, David Kessler. Naughton is really the face of the film, and David's tragic story is one that is full of ups and downs that are both horrifying and absurdly comedic. After this film, Naughton continued acting, appearing in projects like Makin' It, My Sister Sam, and Granite Flats. Notably, Naughton's film career has remained firmly in the horror genre, and he continued to appear in horror films until 2017. Ultimately, An American Werewolf in London was a massive part of Naughton's career, and it clearly affected the projects he worked on afterward.\nThough his character isn't alive for long, Jack Goodman is arguably the second most important character in An American Werewolf in London. Jack returns to haunt David after his death, revealing to him his new werewolf identity and urging David to cut off the bloodline, so that he can be free. He is played by Griffin Dunne. Following his role as Jack Goodman, Dunne went on to become an established and successful actor, director, and producer. He has worked on popular projects like This is Us, Ocean's 8, Practical Magic and The French Dispatch, however his biggest role outside An American Werewolf in London is the 1986 film After Hours.\nOf the main An American Werewolf in London cast, Griffin Dunne is the actor that is still the most active. Dunne's most recent work includes a 2023 movie entitled Ex-Husbands in which he is both executive producer and actor. Additionally, Dunne has a new television series on the horizon called The Girls on the Bus, which has no release date as of yet. Plus, Dunne has appeared in a variety of popular series of the time including Succession, Billions, Search Party, and The L Word: Generation Q. All in all, Griffin Dunne seems to be far from retiring from Hollywood, unlike many of his An American Werewolf in London costars.\nDespite the horrors David is facing, he still manages to find love in An American Werewolf in London with a kind-hearted nurse named Alex Price, played by Jenny Agutter. Unlike her costars, Agutter began acting as a child, and had already achieved moderate success before An American Werewolf in London. Before the film, she won both an Emmy and a BAFTA award. Furthermore, Agutter is known for her work on the British franchise The Railway Children, which she worked on most recently in 2022. Though she has appeared on-screen often since 1981, Agutter's best known projects include The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Call the Midwife.\nLike Griffin Dunne, Jenny Agutter is still present in the acting world. She has most recently appeared in the 2022 film The Railway Children Return, and also, still appears on the BBC series Call the Midwife, which she has been a part of for all twelve seasons. Although much of Agutter's work is rooted in the British film and television landscape, she has made quite a name for herself both in England and the U.S.\nAfter David and Jack are attacked by the werewolf, Inspector Villiers tells David they were attacked by \"an escaped lunatic,\" however, David disagrees. For the rest of the film, Villiers lingers around David as he comes to terms with his new identity, until unfortunately, the inspector sees a tragic fate at the end of An American Werewolf in London. Inspector Villiers is played by Don McKillop. While McKillop began his career in television, with appearances in series like Doctor Who and Sutherland's Law, his final project after An American Werewolf in London was a 1982 TV movie called Walter. During his acting career, McKillop also worked as a metalwork teacher.\nAt the age of 94, John Woodvine has appeared in countless stage shows, television series, and movies, including An American Werewolf in London, where he played Dr. J.S. Hirsch. Dr. Hirsch cares for David after the attack, but becomes suspicious of him due to his refusal to accept that he was attacked by a human. Hirsch investigates, going to the Slaughtered Lamb where David and Jack were attacked, but before he can solve the mystery, David is out of control. Following An American Werewolf in London, Woodvine appeared in projects such as Wuthering Heights, Persuasion, Vanity Fair, and The Crown. Woodvine's biggest achievements are likely concerning his theater roles.\nDespite his very brief appearance, Frank Oz's involvement in An American Werewolf in London must be mentioned. The famed puppeteer, actor, and director plays Mr. Collins. Collins visits David in the hospital and tells him that his parents have been notified of what happened. After, he complains to Dr. Hirsch that today's youth don't appreciate anything. Oz's career had already begun before An American Werewolf in London, and only blossomed further after the film. Oz is best known for his portrayals of the Muppets and Yoda in Star Wars. After 1981, he continued portraying these characters in various films along with performances in Monsters Inc., Inside Out, and Knives Out.\n"}
{"title": "MCU Phase 4 Director Reignites MCU Vs. DCEU Debates", "date": "2023-10-09 14:40:28", "text": "The debate regarding the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DCEU continues as one of the MCU's Phase 4 directors chimes in on the two franchises.\nThe never-ending debate about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DCEU continues after director Mohamed Diab, who worked on Moon Knight in Phase 4, gives his thoughts about the two gargantuan superhero franchises. Even before they were major Hollywood movie franchises, there has always been a rivalry between the DC and Marvel audiences. Whether it is about which has the stronger superheroes, the better storylines, or the best rogue's gallery, there are plenty of aspects that can be debated about when it comes to DC and Marvel.\nIn terms of the DCEU and MCU, the latter has had a more stable success since its launch in 2008 compared to the former, which began in 2013. One of the elements that have been heavily criticized about the DCEU movie timeline is the general tone set by Zack Snyder's movies, and Moon Knight director Mohammed Diab reflected on these sentiments in an interview with Arabic Marvel (translated via The Cosmic Circus). After discussing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Phase 4 director opened up about why he prefers the MCU as opposed to the DCEU, while also sharing his admiration for James Gunn and what he will do with the new DC Universe:\nI know that some people don’t like James Gunn, but I see him as a great artist who will do great work. Frankly, I didn’t like the past period. The last film, [Zack Snyder's] Justice League, was significantly better than the first version, but in the end, Snyder’s work in all the movies he made didn’t appeal to me. I liked James Gunn’s films much more. I think he’s a much greater artist and a very clever writer, and he will do excellent work for DC. I hope people won’t just criticize him because if he loses the DC audience, he’s done. But he is an artist, and he will create wonderful things.\nRELATED: How To Watch the Marvel Movies In Order (By Release Date & In Order Of MCU Timeline Events)\nEven with the DCEU almost over, there will always be discussions about which is the stronger superhero franchise. Despite the MCU having a bigger financial success, there are still elements where the DCEU has thrived. For example, it took them less than five years to get a solo female superhero movie with Wonder Woman, while Marvel Studios took way longer for Captain Marvel to happen. However, at the same time, the MCU has shown that having a plan and sticking to it works, whereas the DCEU has fumbled repeatedly when it comes to that aspect.\nUltimately, the MCU and the DCEU - and soon the DC Universe - will need each other's success in order to continue growing. The discussion about superhero fatigue has become a bigger topic this year in light of a lot of box office struggles. The comic book movie genre isn't the problem, but more so the type of stories that the studios are choosing to tell, meaning that perhaps they need to switch things up in terms of what heroes and villains they choose to adapt for the big screen.\nIt will definitely be interesting to see how Gunn's DC Universe holds up against the MCU when it starts, especially as he was one of the filmmakers to bring success to Marvel Studios during his tenure. In the case of the MCU, they still have the Multiverse Saga going on, with some of the bigger projects yet to come, which may add more hype to their long-term game. Time will tell if the MCU and DC Universe will have the same rivalry in the coming years, as more movies continue getting released.\nSource: Arabic Marvel (translated via The Cosmic Circus)\n"}
{"title": "Every Upcoming Superhero Movie In 2023", "date": "2023-10-09 14:30:27", "text": "The MCU, DCU, Spider-Verse, and more have had new installments come out this year. Here is every upcoming superhero movie releasing in 2023.\nAfter a unique year for the genre, every upcoming superhero movie in 2023 has an important role to play in the movie landscape, especially for the MCU and DCEU. The rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2008 and increasing competition from DC and Sony's Spider-Man franchises have made it so comic book movies are frequently some of the most popular films each year. 2022 was no different, as nine superhero movies were released from various existing cinematic universes and a few new attempted franchise starters. This does not even take the various superhero TV shows releasing on network television and streaming services into account, which are set to extend the DC and MCU release timeline respectively.\n2023's superhero movies represent more examples of how the genre is changing and evolving as time goes on. MCU Phase 5 kicked off in full force with three highly anticipated sequels, two of which end current trilogies. Meanwhile, the DCEU movie roster comes to an end in 2023, as DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran prepare plans to reboot the DC Universe. Sony is also set to continue exploring two sides of its Spider-Man franchises, one with strong multiverse connections and one that is another Spider-Man villain solo film. All in all, 2023 brings eight superhero movies that encompass the MCU, DCU, and Spider-Verse.\nRelated: All Marvel Movies Releasing In 2023\nThe final MCU 2023 movie arrives on July 28 with The Marvels.

The sequel to 2018's surprise box office hit is once again directed by James Wan and brings Jason Momoa back as Arthur Curry. Aquaman 2 is taking the story in a surprising direction, as the movie has been described as a buddy adventure film with Aquaman and his villain half-brother Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson). It is also known that Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) returns, but it remains to be seen if Mera (Amber Heard) will make the final cut. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is planned as the final DCEU film.\nRelated: Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom: Cast, Story, & Everything We Know\n2023's first superhero movie was Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which debuted in theaters on February 17. Directed by Peyton Reed, the movie began MCU Phase 5, serving as audience's initiation into the Multiverse Saga. The sequel brings back franchise leads Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, for a story that follows Ant-Man, Wasp, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, and a recast Cassie Lang getting stuck in the Quantum Realm. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania also introduced Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who is set to be the MCU's big bad throughout the Multiverse Saga.\nThe first DC superhero movie of 2023 arrived on March 17, when Shazam: Fury of the Gods hit theaters. Coming four years after the original film was released, Shazam 2 was directed by David F. Sandberg, and once again starred Zachary Levi and Asher Angel as Shazam/Billy Batson. The entire Shazam Family cast also returned, alongside the introduction of DC's Daughters of Atlas - Hespera (Helen Mirren), Kalypso (Lucy Liu), and Anthea (Rachel Zegler) - who played both villains and allies in the movie.\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy franchise returned after a six-year hiatus when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 released on May 5, finishing the movie trilogy. The 2023 superhero movie was directed by James Gunn and brought the original Guardians team together one more time before the new Guardians of the Galaxy team formed. The story follows Star-Lord's (Chris Pratt) search for Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) and Rocket's (Bradley Cooper) origin. The team also will fight the villainous High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), with the latter becoming a part of the new Guardians roster, finally capitalizing on the character's introduction in 2017.\nThe first of Sony's 2023 superhero movies was Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which debuted in theaters on June 2. The sequel to Sony's surprise animated hit Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse retains writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller but brings in a new trio of directors with various experience in the genre. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's story follows Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), and Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) once more as they get wrapped up in a multiversal Spider-Man fight. This includes utilizing Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya), Spider-Woman (Issa Rae), and more.\nAnother multiverse 2023 superhero movie arrived on June 16 when Warner Bros. finally released The Flash. Originally announced in 2014, the long-awaited solo film for Barry Allen comes from IT director Andy Muschietti, and retained controversial star Ezra Miller after their past DC movie appearances. The Flash's multiverse story allows Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton's Batman to play roles and explain the introduction of Supergirl (Sasha Calle). The story follows Barry Allen trying to save his mother from dying which changes the universe, and received a less than stellar reception upon its release.\nThe DC 2023 movie slate also saw Blue Beetle release in August. The film stars Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridueña and is an origin story for Jaime Reyes, a Latino teenager who bonds with a symbiotic scarab that gives him superpowers, transforming him into Blue Beetle.

If the family enjoys the movie, Netflix also offers a streaming series and a holiday special following the characters.\nWatch on Netflix\nOne of the best family movies on Netflix is also one of the best Christmas movies on the streamer.

The movie might be a little cheesy for older kids, but it will definitely bring the family together if they’re looking for a holiday movie to enjoy.\nWatch on Netflix\nDisney’s animated Peter Pan might be available on Disney+, but the live-action Hook is currently available on Netflix. It gives the audience a look at what might happen if Peter Pan decided to grow up instead of remain a boy in Neverland forever. Complete with Robin Williams as Peter, Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, and Dustin Hoffman as Hook, the movie has an impressive cast and infectious spirit that makes it a great successor to any adaptation of Peter Pan. It’s definitely a movie adults can share with their kids.\nWatch on Netflix\nThough the 1990s saw a live-action adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Matilda (which is also on Netflix), a Broadway musical adaptation of the book followed. This version of Matilda adapts the Broadway musical fantastically. Featuring Emma Thompson as the villain and Alisha Weir as the titular Matilda, the movie stands out from the previous adaptation thanks to its impressive musical numbers. The cast has fantastic chemistry and Weir earned several award nominations in England and Ireland for her work in the movie.\nWatch on Netflix\nThe Christmas Chronicles is one of Netflix’s earliest takes on an original holiday movie, and it’s easily one of the best family movies on Netflix. In it, children conspire to kidnap Santa Claus, played fantastically by Kurt Russell. The kids wind up having to assist Santa with delivering his gifts, giving them a great Christmas adventure and the audience a pretty cool Santa. Kurt Russell’s Santa is definitely unique among the many Santas that exist in pop culture. If the family enjoys the movie, there’s also a sequel on Netflix with Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus.\nWatch on Netflix\nSeeing Jason Momoa stepping into a family-friendly movie feels a little odd at first, but he is the best part of Slumberland. Slumberland follows a little girl — Nemo, played by Marlow Barkley — who lost her father and ends up entering a portal to Slumberland, the world in which dreams exist. She meets the eccentric outlaw Flip (Momoa), a man-goat hybrid and notorious con artist, and the pair set out on an adventure to fun her father. The inventive setting and Momoa's performance help to make this Netflix original a charming tale, with enough action and suspense to entertain both adults and kids of around 8 and up. Younger viewers may find some scenes scary given Slumberland's fantastical elements (such as Flip's sharpened teeth), but outside this Slumberland is guaranteed to deliver for a difficulty-free family movie on Netflix.\nWatch on Netflix\nA family movie on Netflix that'll engage viewers in the 5-6 age range, as well as older kids and adults, is Lyle, Lyle Crocodile. Like Hop, the fun of Lyle, Lyle Crocodile comes from having a talking CGI animal thrown in with the bemused characters and watching the hilarity ensue. The live-action adaptation of a children's book about a singing crocodile could have been a big miss, so it is impressive that Lyle, Lyle Crocodile ended up as charming as it is. The movie follows the titular crocodile who lives with a family in New York City, helping to make their lives better. It is a silly yet fun ride with a surprisingly committed performance from Javier Bardem, clearly having a lot of fun in the movie.\nWatch on Netflix\nAs far as family movies on Netflix that are part of existing properties go, few belong to as recognizable a household name as Goosebumps — and the 2015 movie starring Jack Black is nothing if not a celebration of source material. Bringing R.L Stine's beloved children's horror book series to life was no easy task, but Goosebumps found a clever way to handle the material. The movie follows a group of youngsters who meet R. L Stine (Black) and accidentally unleash the horrors from his books. Goosebumps features a notably committed comedic performance from Jack Black, and spiritually taps into the legacy of classics like Jumanji and Ghost Busters. Younger viewers may struggle with the horror elements of Goosebumps, but parents with kids between the ages of 7-9 have reported getting thumbs-ups and no nightmares. This is definitely a family movie on Netflix which, provided the youngest viewers present have a proclivity for Halloween and all things spooky, will be enjoyed by adults as much as the kids.\nWatch on Netflix\nRELATED: Best Coming-Of-Age Movies On Netflix\n\nMatt Berger is a writer, comedian, actor, Paddington enthusiast, and Corgi dad.

Spun off from Cheers, Frasier revolves around Kelsey Grammer’s neurotic psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane. In the original series, Frasier moved from Boston to Seattle and reluctantly allowed his estranged father Martin to live with him, which led to a heartwarming emotional reconnection across 11 critically acclaimed seasons. The reboot sees Frasier moving back to Boston to reconnect with his own estranged son, Freddy.\nThe third series to feature Dr. Crane in a key role is shaping up to be one of the hottest shows of the year. Although Grammer is the only cast member from the original series in the main cast of the reboot, the reboot is bringing back the original show’s classic multi-camera format. But it isn’t being broadcast on a traditional TV network like its predecessor; the Frasier reboot is a streaming exclusive that can only be watched on a certain streaming service.\nRELATED: Frasier's Reboot Answers The Original 19-Year-Old Cliffhanger Mystery\nThe Frasier reboot can be streamed on Paramount+. The series will premiere on October 12 with two episodes – episode 1, “The Good Father,” and episode 2, “Moving In” – after which new episodes will debut on the service weekly. Both Frasier’s new streaming home and its original network home, CBS, are owned by the same media conglomerate (formerly known as Viacom, now known as Paramount Global), so Paramount+ is keeping Dr. Crane in the family. The reboot’s first season will consist of 10 episodes, concluding its run on December 7.\nAll 11 seasons of the original Frasier series are available to be streamed on Hulu. The series is also available on Paramount+, where the new reboot will be airing, but only eight of the show’s 11 seasons are available to stream on there. To watch the entire series for the cost of a streaming subscription, Hulu is the best place to go. But it can also be bought or rented elsewhere.\nBesides Hulu and Paramount+, there are other streaming services where the original Frasier series is available to buy or rent. Seasons 1 through 11 are available to stream with a Prime Video membership until October 31. The last two seasons can also be purchased on Prime at a cost of $18.09 for season 10 and $19.99 for season 11 (or $2.99 per episode). All 11 seasons are available to buy on Google Play at a cost of $14.99 per season. The entire series is also available to buy on iTunes at a cost of $24.99 for all 11 seasons.\n"}
{"title": "Everything We Know About The Zeffo, The Ancient Aliens Who Once Ruled Star Wars' Galaxies", "date": "2023-10-09 14:30:26", "text": "Throughout a few Star Wars properties, a race of beings known as the Zeffo has been mentioned. Here is everything we know about the ancient species.\nDifferent sects of the Star Wars franchise have included mention of an ancient race known as the Zeffo which once ruled the galaxy; here is everything we know about the species. The Zeffo, or Zeffonians, were first introduced to the Star Wars franchise through the 2018 video game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Since then, they have been mentioned in novels and comics connected to the game with even an Easter egg coming in Ahsoka linking to the ancient aliens.\nRelated: Ahsoka Episode 6 Ties Star Wars' Future To An Unexpected Story From 5 Years Ago\nBesides Ahsoka's Star Wars Zeffo reference, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has provided the most information about the Zeffonian race in the franchise. While upcoming Star Wars movies could further explore the ancient aliens, it seems unlikely given the mysterious disappearance of the species within the galaxy. With that said, here is everything Star Wars has provided concerning information on the Zeffo from their origins to their time in the galaxy and their mystifying absence.\nIn Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, it was explained that the Zeffo was a Force-sensitive race. Like the brief tidbits of information provided about Yoda's race, most Zeffonians held an inherent connection with the Force. The Zeffo were also incredibly ancient with their origins in the Star Wars galaxy dating back tens of thousands of years even predating the Jedi Order. In Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, it was established that the Zeffo were a peaceful race that referred to the Force as \"Life Wind\" with those capable of wielding the Force the best consisting of the Zeffonian version of the Jedi Order.\nThese powerful Zeffonian Force wielders were named Sages, something that features at length in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, In that game, it was revealed that three of the most powerful Zeffo Sages in the species' history were buried across the Star Wars galaxy on differing planets. These three Sages were named Eilram, Miktrull, and Kujet. The former two Sages were buried on the Zeffo homeworld. Eilram's tomb was situated in the halls of the Great School on Zeffo and was adorned with drawings of the Wroshyr Tree on Kashyyyk signifying the Zeffonian's fondness for the planet.\nMiktrull was buried in another tomb on Zeffo, hanging high above an abyss with various candles lighting the tomb. Kujet, however, had his tomb situated on Dathomir. At one point, Kujet ruled the Zeffo alone with his palace being located on Dathomir, explaining why the planet served as his resting place.\nGiven their connection to other planets, the Zeffo had colonized various different worlds across the Star Wars galaxy and beyond. From the planets the Zeffo inhabited in the Mid Rim to the Outer Rim territories and Zeffo itself, the race had a wide-reaching grasp on the ancient Star Wars galaxy. As such, here is every Zeffonian planet in the Star Wars franchise both in the prime galaxy and beyond.\nThe most obvious planet the Zeffo colonized was their home world of Zeffo. This is the primary location of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The planet contains the tombs of Eilram and Miktrull as well as a vast array of other Zeffonian structures that prove the wide-reaching culture of the Zeffo and explain why they had such an impact on the wider galaxy.\nWhile Zeffo is the main planet shown to have housed Zeffonian culture in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Bogano is the first visited in the game that hints at Zeffonian involvement in the galaxy. The entire crux of the game is to enter a vault on Bogano built by the Zeffo to access a Holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children across the galaxy. The various Zeffo structures on Bogano hold a strong connection to the Force as a result and provide hints for the game's main character, Cal Kestis, to travel to other Zeffo-controlled planets of old.\nOne of these planets in question is Dathomir. Before the introduction of the Zeffo, Dathomir was primarily known as the home of the Nightsisters, Star Wars' race of witches. However, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order revealed that Kujet was buried on the planet of Dathomir amid his giant palace. Kujet once ruled the Zeffo after the deaths of Eilram and Miktrull as a ruthless, dark-side practitioner with Dathomir as his seat of power.\nWhile there is no evidence of the Zeffo colonizing Kashyyyk, it has been made clear that the race often frequented the Wookiee homeworld. Sage Eilram was known to have a strong connection with the Wookiees as evidenced by his tomb featuring a mural of the Wroshyr Tree from Kashyyyk. At this tree, Cal finds a hologram leading him to Dathomir and linking the two Zeffo-infused planets together.\nOne of the more interesting links between Star Wars canon and the Zeffo is the reference to the species in Ahsoka. Ahsoka included a second Star Wars galaxy as it was largely set on the planet of Peridea. In Ahsoka episode 6, runes can be seen on a fortress situated on Peridea reading \"Praise Kujet ruler of all, may his reign last,\" proving that Kujet, the Sith Zeffo Sage, had ruled over Peridea at one point in his life.\nThis Ahsoka Easter egg seems to provide evidence that Kujet ruled over the Nightsisters at one point. Another interesting retcon of the Star Wars galaxy found in Ahsoka was that the Nightsisters originally hailed from Peridea both explaining their strange culture and also their different utilization of the Force through Magick. The Nightsisters eventually left Peridea using the Purrgil to settle on the planet of Dathomir.\nAll of this proves that Kujet seemingly ruled over the Nightsisters. His name is mentioned on Peridea as a ruler with whoever inscribed the runes hoping for his reign to last. It would make sense then for Kujet to move to the main Star Wars galaxy alongside the Nightsisters with both settling on Dathomir, the home of the Nightsisters in modern Star Wars and the place of Kujet's palace.\nAfter the deaths of Eilram and Miktrull, Kujet began leading the Zeffo as a dark, ruthless, Sith Zeffonian. This was seen as the beginning of the end of Zeffonian dominance in the Star Wars galaxy. Kujet's dark reign resulted in a once-peaceful race becoming corrupted to the point where they faced extinction upon Kujet's death. This led to the remaining Zeffo vowing to disappear into the Unknown Regions, hoping to find peace once more among the stars.\nRelated: Ahsoka May Have Solved A Massive Disney Star Wars Mystery About Who Came Before The Jedi\nThis was explored in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. In that game, a recording can be found in which a Zeffonian is heard explaining this plan to travel into the Unknown Regions after Kujet's demise:\n\"I offer this record of our civilization to those who will follow. Despite our wisdom and technological achievement, we face extinction. Dogma blinded us to the path of balance and gradually we allowed our pride to corrupt us. The greater control we sought, the further we fell into ruin. I lead the remnants of my people into the great unknown, hoping that we finally find peace.\"\nThis could prove that the Zeffo left the Star Wars galaxy. After their disappearance into the Unknown Regions, the Zeffo were never seen again. Now that Ahsoka has established the idea of neighboring galaxies and even that the Zeffo once resided in one, the ancient Star Wars race may have simply disappeared into another galaxy to find peace after their corruption at the hands of the dark side of the Force.\n"}

Contains spoilers for Wonder Woman #1!The public image of Wonder Woman is cratering, and the world is turning against her. A heartbreaking cover reveals how the DC hero is turning from a beloved icon into a hated enemy - while her mission hasn't changed, Diana is now considered a supervillain by the American public.\nDC Comics has revealed what it has lined up for December, and there are a lot of goodies for fans to enjoy. The Titans-centric \"Beast World\" crossover continues to change the DC Universe in unexpected ways while Batman / Santa Claus: Silent Knight sees the Dark Knight and Saint Nick team up to save Christmas. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman's new era sees the Amazing Amazon fighting hatred and bigotry against her people.\nWith the world losing trust in the Amazons, Wonder Woman takes a moment to grant the wish of a dying boy and gives him the perfect day. Meanwhile, the Sovereign constricts his grip on the government. Will Wonder Woman be able to hold out hope as the world around her grows darker?\nThe solicitation for Wonder Woman #4 reveals that the ire brewing across the nation for the Amazons is hitting Wonder Woman hard, even as she tries to give a dying child the most perfect day possible. Despite Diana's best intentions, the vitriol against Amazons is getting worse. Daniel Sampere's cover shows a mural of the beloved hero is being defaced with graffiti. The image of Wonder Woman has been crossed out with a giant 'No' symbol as hurtful phrases such as \"Traitor\", \"Get Out!\", and \"Amazons go home\" are spray-painted onto the legend.\nWonder Woman might be one of the most beloved heroes around, but in an instant, public opinion started to turn against the leading DC figure's heritage. After an Amazon murdered nearly 20 men in a bar, the United States government reacted by creating an anti-Amazon task force and expelling every Amazon from American soil. Though not everyone believes Amazons are to be feared, enough paranoia has begun running rampant through the country and allowed hatred, bigotry and violence towards Amazons to flourish.\nEven Wonder Woman, a hero who has defended America, Earth, and the larger DC Universe numerous times over the years, is not free from the prejudice that's spiraling out of control. While the uneasy feelings are being stoked by major players with their own anti-Amazon agendas, it's unfortunate to see average people swayed by the hysteria that's boiled over in an instant. Diana has fought and bled for friends and enemies alike, all in the name of love and peace. But despite her years of service to the world, its people are turning on her, a sign of the dark new direction of the DC Universe.\nThanks to the actions of Insomnia in Knight Terrors, the reputation of DC heroes isn't faring very well, with many becoming afraid of what heroes are capable of. Wonder Woman may have not been responsible for the rogue Amazon's actions, but it's certainly not helping Diana fix her image in the public eye. Wonder Woman is seen by many as the best of the best and one of the most trustworthy and honorable heroes. If the public is losing faith in Wonder Woman, what hope do any other heroes have for regaining the trust of the world? Right now is the worst possible time for Diana's relationship with the public to sour, and if nothing changes, the world may stop trusting heroes altogether. Fans can get their hands on Daniel Sampere's cover when Wonder Woman #4 releases on December 19th.\n"}

Debuting in September, Daryl Dixon sees Norman Reedus' titular character washing ashore in France where he's not sure why he's there or even how he arrived at his destination. Eventually, he's enlisted to take care of Laurent (Louis Puech Scigliuzzi), a boy who is believed to be destined for greatness. Created by David Zabel, the six-episode AMC series also features an ensemble that includes Harry Potter alum Clémence Poésy and sees Melissa McBride reprise her role as Carol Peletier.\nAs reported by Variety, AMC has confirmed that The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon now has the biggest premiere in the history of the AMC+ streaming service. This puts it ahead of The Walking Dead: Dead City, which achieved the milestone back in June. Daryl Dixon is also on track to become the most-viewed season of any show in the history of AMC+. Dead City and Daryl Dixon will return for season 2.\nFor ratings, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4 achieved new highs both in terms of viewership and the adults in the 25-54 demographic. Counting the Nielsen Live+3 numbers, the spinoff hit 1.1 million with its fourth installment. That includes 392,000 viewers in the aforementioned demographic. But the Norman Reedus-led drama is not only a success in terms of its audience, it's also received positive reviews across the board.\nDespite the fact that some have noted similarities to HBO's The Last of Us, the spinoff has been called the best Walking Dead show in years. On Rotten Tomatoes, Daryl Dixon boasts a 90% approval rating based on 35 reviews. But the specific details are more significant, showing that the AMC series has an average rating of 8.1/10. That means, of those who reviewed the show, many came away with a strongly positive impression.\nRelated: The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon Cast & Character Guide\nThe audience rating is similarly high, sitting at 87%. Reedus receives a lot of credit as the name of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, but the overall quality indicates a potential long-term path for the veteran zombie adaptation, provided that it can combine a compelling narrative for familiar faces that audiences already know quite well. That seems to be the selling point of the France-set saga, with how it freshens up a long-running franchise.\nSource: Variety\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

{"title": "All 10 Adventure Time Seasons, Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-09 14:20:27", "text": "With 10 seasons under its belt, Adventure Time has had its ups and downs. Here's how every season ranks — from worst to the best of the best.\nEvery Adventure Time season sent its protagonists, Finn and Jake, on plenty of thrilling, comical, and moving escapades, with highs and lows across 283 episodes. While Pendleton Ward's fantasy series is by and large considered one of the best and most influential animated programs of the last decade, some of Adventure Time's 10 seasons were better than others. The show grew from a simple yet strange concept: Finn the human (Jeremy Shada) and his best bud Jake (John DiMaggio), a dog with shape- and size-shifting powers, find themselves adventuring across the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo to help its denizens with problems both (universe-altering) big and small.\nIn addition to the world-building, the Adventure Time characters, from the bumbling Ice King (Tom Kenny) and the guitar-strumming Marceline the Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson) to the science-obsessed Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch) and her anthropomorphic candy citizens, are also incredible. As the series progresses, it grows from one-off, self-contained episodes into something much more complicated and cosmic. That's all part of what made viewers fall in love with the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning series — and why it remains a cult hit over a decade after its premiere. Here are allAdventure Time seasons, ranked from worst to best.\nWithout a doubt, Adventure Time season 6 marked a tonal shift for the series. For some viewers, it was an exciting change, but, for others, it missed the mark. Given the mixed feelings on season 6, it ranks a tad lower than other seasons of the hit series. While it started strong with episodes like \"Wake Up\" and \"Escape From the Citadel,\" it largely trades the series' signature offbeat humor for more philosophical musings and world-building lore. That's not a bad thing, but other seasons of Adventure Time balance the serious and the comic more deftly.\nThe chapter that started it all, Adventure Time's first season gives very little indication as to where the series will lead in its later arcs. Nonetheless, its quirky characters, offbeat humor, and memorable world-building helped establish a solid foundation on which to build. Composed largely of self-contained episodes, it's difficult to compare season 1's goofy-forward offerings with the more complex, ponderous narratives later seasons of Adventure Time achieve, but it's still a \"mathematical\" watch in what would become one of the best Cartoon Network shows.\nIn its ninth season, Adventure Time delves into another multi-episode arc with its eight-part \"Elements\" narrative. In it, Finn and Jake have to undo the elemental magic that's transformed the Land of Ooo into a dystopia. Other key episodes include \"Three Buckets,\" the season 9 finale that sees Finn's grass-made double questioning his identity and existence, as well as \"Ketchup,\" a BMO-centric gem.\nAn ever-goofy Finn grows up a bit more in season 2 and that's reflected in the series' writing too, which trades juvenile humor and silly slang terms invented by Finn and Jake for more character-driven stories. For starters, a teenage Finn grapples with his feelings for Princess Bubblegum, while characters like Marceline become much less one-dimensional. Even Ice King, who was a bumbling villain in the first outing, becomes more human, leaving his ineffectual villainy on the sidelines while he confronts his loneliness.\nMost memorably, Adventure Time season 8 features a multi-episode miniseries of sorts, \"Islands,\" that delves more deeply into Finn's past. After encountering a robotic craft of foreign origin, Finn, Jake, and Susan (another human) set sail for a far-off civilization. There, they learn more about Susan (a.k.a. Kara), and Finn meets his mother. After so many episodes, it's nice to get some answers about Finn's origins, but season 8 is about more than \"Islands.\" Other stand-out episodes include the informative \"Broke His Crown\" and the surprisingly compelling \"Normal Man.\"\nIn its final season, Adventure Time takes big swings, all to wrap up its cosmic, over-arching narrative while giving its characters proper send-offs. In season 10, Princess Bubblegum confronts her villainous Uncle Gumbald in the fight for Candy Kingdom; Finn faces off against a darker version of Fern; Marceline makes peace with her frustrating father, Hunson; and Betty sacrifices herself to the entity GOLB, the embodiment of chaos and disorder, to save Simon. Plus, season 10 contains the four-part series finale, \"Come Along with Me,\" and introduces the intriguing duo Shermy and Beth — the spiritual successors to Finn and Jake of the future.\nAdventure Time season 4 is all about relationships — and humor. Not only does Finn get closer to Flame Princess, but the fourth season also features the episode where Tree Trunks and Pig overdo their PDA, making everyone uncomfortable. Memorably, Adventure Time season 4 also boasts several experimental chapters, like \"Five Short Graybles\" and \"BMO Noir,\" as well as some character-driven, backstory-revealing episodes, like \"I Remember You,\" which delves into Marceline and Ice King's (a.k.a. Simon's) painful, shared past in a solid season of what can be considered one of the best animated shows of all time.\nSeason 3 of the series features tons of classics, from \"Hitman\" and \"Holly Jolly Secrets\" to the first episode centering on Adventure Time's Fionna and Cake, Finn and Jake's gender-swapped counterparts. One of the season's most memorable episodes, \"What Was Missing,\" teases Princess Bubblegum and Marceline's romantic history for the first time. In retrospect, Adventure Time season 3 is so successful because it excels at balancing humor and heart — crucial backstory, and one-off fun.\nFor fans of Marceline (and, by extension, the slow-burn rekindling of Marceline and Princess Bubblegum's romantic relationship), Adventure Time season 7 is an instant favorite. The season's eight-episode story arc, \"Stakes,\" centers on Marcie, who asks PB to cure her of her vampirism. No longer wanting to be immortal, Marceline allows Bonnie to extract her vampire essence, but, of course, complications arise. Bolstered by music penned by Rebecca Sugar (Steven Universe), season 7 hits some of the series' emotional highs, all while maintaining its signature humor and surreality.\nTwice the length of any season before it, Adventure Time's fifth season boasts a whopping 52 episodes. Based on sheer volume alone, season 5 has a little something for every Adventure Time fan, from \"Simon & Marcy\" to \"Root Beer Guy.\" For some viewers, it's where the series jumped the shark, trading its goofiness for ever-growing, ever-complicated Adventure Time lore-related episodes. Still, for most diehards, season 5 only deepens Adventure Time's appeal and cements its now-enduring legacy.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

{"title": "Prisoners Ending Explained: Does Loki Find Keller?", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:30", "text": "Prisoners was released in 2013, by acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve, and has a complex mystery at its center. Here is the film’s ending explained.\n\nThe Prisoners ending adds to the highly complex and dark nature of the detective-thriller from Denis Villeneuve. The film tells the gut-wrenching story of a family Thanksgiving dinner that ends with two young girls disappearing. The film's central two characters, Keller Dover and Detective Loki played by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal respectively, are then taken on a complex ride as both try to figure out the mystery through their own means, leading to the unforgettable Prisoners ending.\nKeller Dover, the father of Anna, one of the missing children, goes to a dark place in Prisoners, even kidnapping and torturing a person of his own, Alex Jones, in his search for answers making it a gripping movie about moral dilemmas. Eventually, Dover finds out that Alex Jones is actually Barry Milland and was kidnapped by his \"mother\" Holly Jones, who has taken Keller's daughter and her friend Joy. Prisoners' ending sees Keller left in a pit beneath Holly's house after Loki exposes Holly and saves Anna. Prisoners reaches this endpoint through a series of twists and turns and leaves its ending purposely ambiguous\n.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nOne of the biggest questions the Prisoners ending leaves is why Holly Jones, played by Melissa Leo, and her husband prior to his disappearance were kidnapping children in the first place. While Prisoners does answer this, the film's complex emotional story can allow certain aspects to become lost beneath the hard-hitting way the movie is presented. Also, as Holly is introduced early in the film, things that are revealed about her when she is \"innocent\" in the eyes of the audience can be forgotten once the reveal of her true nature comes to light.\nThroughout the film, it is revealed that Holly and her husband adopted Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano of recent The Batman fame, after the death of their own son to cancer. Throughout the film, Alex is shown to be intellectually disabled, having the IQ of a 10-year-old. It is revealed that this disability comes from the trauma of his own kidnapping by Holly, with her reasoning revealed to Keller later after he figures out Holly's crimes. Holly reveals to Keller that, in revenge against God for allowing their son to die of cancer, she and her husband began kidnapping children of Christian families so that these families would feel a similar crisis of faith that they felt.\nThis war on God was carried out over decades with Alex Jones being one victim. Another victim is also revealed throughout the film, a man named Bob Taylor, played by superhero movie regular David Dastmalchian. Anna and Joy are just two of Holly's latest victims, as the Dovers and Birchs are two Christian families. Despite her husband's disappearance, Holly continued their \"war\" by kidnapping the two children and sending Keller and his family, alongside the Birchs, down their own crisis of faith.\nLeading to the Prisoners ending, Dano's Alex Jones is one of the central characters in some harrowing ways. Firstly, his intellectual disability puts him as one of the film's red herrings, with Alex often making comments that seemingly implicate him in Anna and Joy's kidnapping such as telling Keller: \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" This causes Keller to torture Alex throughout the movie. However, the film reveals that Alex was not involved in the actual kidnapping of the girls, he was only present due to living in the same house as Holly.\nAs Alex, often considered one of Paul Dano's best roles and movies, is a kidnapping victim of Holly's himself and is played off as her adoptive son, he was present in the house when Anna and Joy were taken. Before this, Alex took the girls for a joyride in his RV through seemingly innocent means due to his 10-year-old mental state, and the girls were only taken by Holly after returning to Alex's house. This is why Alex says the line to Keller, which the latter wrongly believes proves his guilt. In reality, Alex was also a victim and his trauma and mental disabilities put him on the wrong side of a grieving father.\nAnother of Holly's kidnapping victims is Bob Taylor. In the film, Taylor is used as another red herring who breaks into the Dovers' house, is found with Anna and Joy's clothes covered in blood, and confesses to the kidnappings before committing suicide. In the scene in which Prisoners, directed by sci-fi movie master Denis Villeneuve, reveals that Holly was responsible for the kidnapping, it is also revealed that Taylor was a former victim of the Jones' that actually escaped, and Holly forgot he existed until he appeared in the news. Taylor, suffering from similar trauma from his experiences as Alex, began emulating his memories of his own kidnapping by Holly and her husband.\nAs Mr. Jones was obsessed with mazes, Taylor's traumatic childhood caused his own mind to break, and become obsessed with them himself, explaining the writing on the walls of his home. Because of Taylor's mental state, it can be argued that he was fantasizing about kidnapping children to emulate Mr. Jones. This explains the seeming plot hole of why he would implicate himself, despite not participating in the kidnapping of Anna and Joy himself.\nOne other plot point is the investigation of Father Dunn by Loki, similarly ranked amongst Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances alongside Dano’s. In the film, Loki visits a local priest and finds a decomposed body in his basement. The priest reveals that the man confessed to killing 16 children in a war against God, resulting in the priest killing the man in retaliation. The man whom the priest killed is later revealed to be Mr. Jones with Holly under the impression that her husband disappeared. However, the maze necklace on the dead body is the same as the one worn by Mr. Jones in an image in Holly's house, with her motivations for kidnapping revealing the connection between the Father and the Jones'.\nWith the majority of the movie's mysteries being answered, the Prisoners ending of the film is left ambiguous. The main way this is done is through Keller Dover's fate, which continues the film's depiction of real-life horror scenarios. At the end of the film, Keller is left in the pit beneath the Jones' pick-up truck for days after Loki saves Anna from Holly. The very last scene in the film sees Loki standing defeated in front of Holly's house, hearing a faint whistle that is being blown by Keller in the pit. Loki shrugs the sound off, before hearing it again and seemingly going to investigate before the film cuts to black.\nWhether Loki saves Dover is left to the audience's interpretation which will no doubt sit differently with some fans. Such an ending with a big unanswered question can frustrate audiences, but Prisoners is a dark and gritty movie that would have felt odd with a definitive happy ending. The Prisoners ending as it stands carries the grim feel of the movie but gives a faint glimmer of hope in the end as well.\nRELATED: 12 Best Movies Like Prisoners\nOne of the lingering questions of Prisoners is what Dover's fate could have been whether Loki did or did not save him. If Loki does not save him, the likelihood is that Dover dies in the pit. Dover was shot by Holly in the leg, and broke that same leg upon falling into the pit. These injuries would be difficult to survive, especially in the cold, unsanitary conditions of the pit. It is likely that Dover blowing the whistle is his last attempt at being saved. Similarly, if Loki does save Keller, it is likely he is arrested for his kidnapping and torture of Alex earlier in the film.\nThe ending of Prisoners, in terms of the final scene and its overall reveals tie together the themes of the movie that director Denis Villeneuve intended. One of these themes is the film's title which has often been subject to debate. The ending of the film sees Loki and Keller, the two protagonists, facing the consequences of becoming prisoners themselves. Dover became a prisoner of his own grief by sacrificing his humanity to find his daughter, which leads him to the pit at the end of the film. Loki also becomes a prisoner to the case due to his obsession with finding the girls, and manages to escape the prison by saving Anna.\nAnother of the film's themes is also faith and religion. The families whose daughters go missing are Christian families, which links to Holly, her husband, Patrick Dunn, and God himself. Holly and Mr. Jones can be seen as the films \"devil,\" waging their war against God. Loki, whose character has many religious tattoos, can be seen as God's \"angel\" who defeats the devil. Dover also fits these religious themes as God's follower who loses his faith and sacrifices his humanity through his kidnap and torture of Alex. The end of the film can be seen as Dover asking God for help, with Loki as the angel potentially saving him, freeing both of the prisons that Prisoners lends its title to.\nThe Prisoners ending is a haunting and thrilling way to end this intense story and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski knew that was the right conclusion. In an interview (via Buzzfeed) Guzikowski spoke about how he enjoyed the ambiguity of the ending, even if he believes what follows is inevitable. Compared to the more explicit version that was shot, he says, \"I like it much better being ambiguous. Even though you assume that's what's probably going to happen, I like that there's a small chance that he's not going to get him out of there for whatever reason.\"\nInterestingly, when it was pointed out that there was no way the determined Detective Loki would not investigate the noise further, Guzikowski suggested Loki might decide to leave Keller there rather than simply miss him. It is a disturbing thought that makes the ending all the more compelling and would certainly reframe Jake Gyllenhaal's character as more villainous than the hero he is in the final version. Even without that ending, Prisoners is a dark movie with a fitting and Guzikowski is thankful it could remain that way, \"It's definitely a testament to Alcon, the producers on the movie, sticking by the script and not wanting to make it into something it wasn't.\"\nThe Prisoners ending might have worked due to its ambiguity, but it almost had a much more definitive conclusion. The Prisoners alternate ending plays out very much the same way as the official ending up until the point that Loki hears the whistle again. This leads to him removing the car that is blocking Keller's hole and Loki is able to find Keller still alive within it. The alternate ending was not planned by the filmmakers but rather an insistence from the studios in case audiences didn't like the uncertainty of the planned ending.\nThe alternate ending proves that the Prisoners ending that audiences got works just fine. Though the extended final scene gives closure, it proves that the reveal that Loki saves Keller doesn't actually add anything to the movie and the ending is more memorable if that question lingers. The alternate ending also further confirms the filmmakers' intention with what the ending means. Even as it cuts to black before Loki actually find Keller, the look on his face is enough to let the audience know Loki is determined now and will find out what is going on.\nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

{"title": "What Happens To The Continental’s Characters Before John Wick Movies", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:29", "text": "The Continental did little to bridge the gap between the show and John Wick, begging the question of what happened to each character in this period.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for The Continental episode 3.\nThe Continental's ending still takes place almost four decades before the John Wick movies, raising the question of what happens to each major character between the two installments of the franchise. When The Continental was announced as a prequel to John Wick, it was expected that the show would tie heavily into the latter franchise given its popularity. In some ways, the Peacock series does exactly this.\nFrom exploring how Winston Scott took control of the titular establishment to the coming together of him and Charon after their close bond was set up in the John Wick films, The Continental's ending adequately explains various elements of the film series it precedes. This is done through various John Wick Easter eggs in The Continental, yet surprisingly the series ends with a large section of the timeline between it and John Wick left unexplored. As such, many have been wondering what happens to the show's various characters in the period between The Continental and 2014's John Wick, especially those who do not feature in the latter films.\nRelated: 10 Unanswered Questions About The World Of John Wick After Its Prequel\nConcerning the main character of The Continental, Winston Scott's journey between the show and John Wick is fairly easy to plot for those familiar with the Keanu Reeves films. In the 35–40 years between The Continental and John Wick, Winston simply spends his time solidifying his position as the manager of the New York Continental. The Continental's ending showcased Winston killing the High Table's Adjudicator in a shocking scene. This scene was in place to show Winston's defiance of the High Table, yet also to establish his alliance with the organization.\nKilling the Adjudicator sent a message; Winston is now here to stay in The Continental and the High Table can either ally with him as they did with Cormac - the former manager Winston took control of the hotel from - or face the consequences of opposing him just as Cormac and the Adjudicator did. As evident by the John Wick films, the High Table opts for the former with Winston holding his position as the proprietor of the eponymous hotel right up until John Wick begins.\nAnother main player in The Continental's cast of characters was Charon, the hotel's concierge played by the late Lance Reddick in the John Wick movies. In The Continental, Charon was shown as the assistant to Cormac before he allied with Winston and aided the latter in his siege of the hotel. Much like with Winston, the events of Charon's life between The Continental and John Wick are left unexplored aside from the fact that he eventually becomes the hotel's concierge. That said, some context clues from Charon's story in The Continental can provide some more specific hints about Charon's life between the two projects.\nA big aspect of Charon's character in The Continental was his wish to bring his father to New York from Nigeria. Cormac used this desire to control Charon which was a turning point for his character once Winston pointed out that Cormac never intended to aid Charon or his family. As of the end of The Continental, Winston is in charge of The Continental with Charon as his ally. As such, it can be inferred that Charon's father is eventually relocated to the United States by Winston to reunite the father and son between the series and John Wick before Charon becomes the concierge of the New York Continental.\nLou and Miles are two new characters for The Continental in that they did not appear or were not mentioned in the John Wick films. Given the almost 40-year gap between the two projects, their journey specifically between the two is shrouded in mystery. Winston and Charon at least have end-points that are highlighted in John Wick, yet Lou and Miles are completely devoid of any story elements in the John Wick films meaning much of their story is left to interpretation.\nLike Charon though, there are some elements of The Continental that can provide potential insight into their journey. For one, Lou's rivalry with the boss of the Chinese mafia is left mostly unresolved. After destroying her dojo, the mafia boss is not featured again in The Continental meaning Lou likely takes revenge against him between the series and John Wick. Concerning the duo together, The Continental episode 2 featured a scene that could hint at a hidden role they have in the John Wick films.\nThe hidden role hinted at in The Continental is the Sommelier from John Wick 2. In the latter film, Wick is sent to the Sommelier in the hotel who provides the iconic hitman with a variety of weapons and ammo. In The Continental episode 2, Winston promises that should they aid him in taking The Continental from Cormac, Lou and Miles will be responsible for providing the hotel with guns and ammunition. This hints that Lou and Miles were responsible for creating the Sommelier position of the establishment and could explain their combined journey between The Continental and John Wick: setting up the hotel’s gun-running organization.\nAnother character whose ending is left frustratingly unclear in The Continental is Yen, Frankie's wife. The Continental episode 3 provides a satisfying enough culmination of Yen's story with the character being provided with the best fight scenes in the show while also getting revenge for Frankie's murder by killing the assassin who conducted it. That said, the ending montage of The Continental provides shockingly little regarding what happens to Yen between The Continental and John Wick.\nGiven that Yen is never mentioned in John Wick, the most likely outcome of Yen's journey is that she returns home to Vietnam. The Continental episode 2 established that she was pushed into being a suicide bomber in the Vietnam War before Frankie found her and the two fled to the United States. While this could provide Yen with some hesitation to return home, she could have stayed in New York for a while before returning to her home country now that Frankie is dead. Aside from this potential outcome, the rest of Yen's story between The Continental and John Wick is left entirely to interpretation.\nGene Jenkins is another original character introduced in The Continental, a sniper who is friends with Miles and aids Winston in his attempt to capture the titular hotel. As is the case with Lou, Miles, and Yen, Gene is not mentioned in any of the John Wick movies meaning his timeline between The Continental and its sequel films is also unclear. However, more so than Yen, Gene's story provides some hints as to what follows his journey in The Continental.\nFor one, Gene is an older man. This means that he likely passed away in the 40 or so years between The Continental and the John Wick films. Regarding what happened between The Continental and his death, Gene likely settled down with the woman whose apartment he sniped from in The Continental episode 3. The episode established a romantic connection between the two and set up a date at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens for Gene and the unnamed woman, hinting at their life together between the show and John Wick.\nThe final character originally created for The Continental and part of its main cast is KD. The Continental ended with KD killing Cormac out of revenge for her family who were killed by Winston on the orders of Mel Gibson's villainous hotel manager. As seems to be common for most Continental characters, her time between the show and John Wick is left unspoken given her absence from the latter franchise. Given her murderous ways and skirting of NYPD rules, KD is likely fired from the force after The Continental and could move away from New York, explaining her absence in John Wick.\n"}

In fact, it's so dangerous, it may be something Storm's faction will forever regret unleashing.\nIn a preview of Al Ewing and Yıldıray Çınar's X-Men Red #16, the mutant warrior War strikes Port Prometheus. It's the latest loss in the battle for Arakko (formerly Mars), in which Storm's resistance forces are fading fast. However, amidst the attack, Syzya of the Smoke retrieves a terrifying weapon - the Uranos Trigger.\nFor months now, Marvel has been teasing that Storm can only win the Genesis War by deploying an \"ultimate weapon\" - now, fans know it's the device the mutants acquired in the aftermath of Marvel's Judgment Day crossover - the Uranos Trigger.\nRelated: X-Men: Nightcrawler's Deadly New HOPESWORD Power - Everything You Need to Know\nIf used, the Uranos Trigger will unleash Thanos' uncle Uranos for one hour. When Uranos last visited Arakko, he devastated the planet, killing 98% of all mutants in a fifty-mile radius of his attack, including Magneto himself. After Uranos' attack, the Eternals (who had unleashed him against Arakko while under Druig's leadership) gave the mutants the weapon that had been used against them as a gift. Uranos is a wildly powerful individual and also has some of the most advanced weaponry in existence sealed away in hidden dimensional vaults only he can access. However, if Storm does use the weapon, his targets will put up a fight worthy of the disgraced Eternal.\nRecently, the Arakki mutant Genesis arrived on the planet, and began seizing control of the civilization while under the influence of the demonic god Annihilation. Storm's resistance group - including Nova, Sunspot, and a variety of Arakko's strongest mutants - have been fighting her ever since, but with little hope of victory. Now, however, they have the ability to unleash what equates to a god of war against their enemies. Unleashing Uranos would likely wipe out Genesis' forces, but with any sliver of time left, Uranos will surely turn on his handlers.\nSyzya of the Smoke may have just handed victory to Storm, but little is known about the heroic mutant. A member of the nation's ruling Great Ring, even Magneto noted her similarities to Nightcrawler: her demonic appearance, prehensile tail, and teleportation powers that create a puff of purple smoke. Given Nightcrawler's father Azazel is a truly ancient mutant, there's a high chance Kurt has many siblings he doesn't know about, and giving him a sister would tie into Marvel's recent attempts to expand his lore as the new Uncanny Spider-Man. It's likely the upcoming X-Men Blue: Origins - coming November from Si Spurrier and Wilton Santos - will settle the relationship between Syzya and Kurt, as the issue promises to reveal the hidden truth of Nightcrawler's origin.\nHowever, whether she's Nightcrawler's sister or not, Syzya just handed Arakko's resistance the ultimate weapon to beat Genesis - if the ragtag group of freedom fighters and former X-Men actually dare to use it.\nX-Men Red #16 is available from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Only One Pokémon is Actually True Evil, & It's Not One Fans Would Expect", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:29", "text": "A Pokémon acting on its own evil desires became a menace in the Pokémon anime, and it proves how terrifying a truly evil Pokémon would really be.\nIn the Pokémon anime in general, there aren't really many evil Pokémon, but rather Pokémon that do evil deeds because their trainers demanded it of them. A few episodes of XY, however, do away with that excuse, by introducing a Pokémon that's pure evil, and the result is absolutely terrifying to think about.\nIn the episode \"A Conspiracy to Conquer!\", Team Rocket falls victim to a mysterious woman going by \"Madame X\" and her Pokémon, Malamar, which hypnotizes them and controls their actions. Meowth escapes and gets help from Ash and the gang, but slowly everyone except for Meowth and Ash fall victim to the Malamar, giving it half a dozens humans and all their Pokémon at its bidding. Things get even worse, however, when it's revealed that Madame X is actually Officer Jenny--and she's being mind controlled, too. Malamar itself was the mastermind behind this evil scheme, and it promptly escapes, ready to continue its plans to conquer the world.\nThe Malamar in the episode is clearly very intelligent to be capable of coming up with such a plan, and its psychic powers seem equally impressive, given how many people it was able to control at once. Malamar is a rare example of an evil Pokémon that's not being influenced in any way, and simply acting on its own desires. Malamar actually goes on to appear later, returning in \"Facing the Grand Design!\", where it has teamed up with two other Malamar to brainwash scientists into creating a dangerous weapon. The Malamar, however, actually manage to escape in this episode as well, but don't show up again--meaning there's still world-conquering evil Pokémon out there.\nMalamar never explains its motivations for wanting to take over the world; it seems to simply think that it can and should. While it's possible that Malamar is out for vengeance in some way, like Mewtwo, it doesn't appear to have a particular target in mind. Their extremely high intelligence might suggest that they were experimented upon, although by who or why is a mystery. It's worth noting that this evil nature doesn't apply to all Malamar; in the second episode where it appears, some friendly Inkay and Malamar help to foil the evil Malamar's plans.\nFortunately, evil Pokémon seem to be pretty rare, but given the sheer number of wild Pokémon in the world, there must be many more out there. The powers that Pokémon wield, even those who aren't Psychic-types like Malamar, have a lot of potential for destruction. Even a few evil Pokémon that wish harm on humans could cause massive amounts of strife and suffering with their abilities. Perhaps defeating evil-minded Pokémon is a task that falls to Legendary Pokémon, many of which are said to maintain balance and peace. Regardless, there are still at least three terrifyingly smart and powerful evil Pokémon out there, free to act as they wish... and Ash might not be there to stop them next time.\n"}

Following up from The First Chapter, Set 2 of the TCG already has a release date for later this year. This second set will feature over 200 new Disney Lorcana cards, which can be acquired through booster packs, starter decks, a new gift set, and a new Illumineer's Trove that's focused on Rise of the Floodborn characters.\nDisney Lorcana: The First Chapter has proven to be a popular beginning for the trading card game, selling out quickly and making cards rather difficult to find. Reprints of this first set are expected to arrive early in 2024. In the meantime, however, Rise of the Floorborn will be released in late 2023. As its name implies, the new set is expected to be focused on Disney Lorcana's Floodborn cards, which feature artwork that are re-imaginings of classic and fan-favorite Disney characters. And from the cards shown so far, there's already a lot to love about Rise of the Floodborn.\nRelated: Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn & Disney100 Edition Cards Revealed\nThe release date for Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn is December 1, 2023.

Anyone looking to get their hands on Rise of the Floodborn early can check out their local store on November 17, 2023, when presales begin.\nThe First Chapter cards sold out quickly and are still somewhat difficult to find. This means that cards from the Rise of the Floodborn set may sell out quickly too, so prospective buyers may want to check with their local games store to see if they'll be getting stock and can reserve items ahead of time. For those who missed out on the first set of cards, though, reprints are expected to hit shelves early in 2024. For now, it also seems likely that this second set will get reprints too, although nothing has been confirmed at the time of this writing.\nRise of the Floodborn will feature new booster packs, two starter decks, a Disney100 Edition gift set, and an Illumineer's Trove. New card sleeves and other accessories will also be available at launch. There are two starter decks shown so far - one featuring the Evil Queen from Snow White and Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, and the other featuring Merlin from The Sword and the Stone and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog.

These are alt art cards from The First Chapter. This gift set will also include 4 booster packs from Rise of the Floodborn, with 12 cards included in each pack.\nThe Illumineer's Trove for Rise of the Floodborn is an impressive array of items. The Trove includes 8 booster packs, 15 game tokens, 2 deck boxes, and a player's guide. It's all inside a collectible storage box featuring characters like Raya from Raya and the Last Dragon, the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland, and Beast from Beauty and the Beast.\nRelated: 10 Characters Cards We Need To See In Disney Lorcana Set 2\nThe booster packs shown so far feature the same characters as the lllumineer's Trove.

Cards from Disney films like Zootopia, The Jungle Book, and The Great Mouse Detective have also been confirmed for this second set from Disney Lorcana. The \"Hypnotize (Emerald)\" card shows Kaa the snake from The Jungle Book. For now, no cards featuring Zootopia or The Great Mouse Detective characters have been officially shown off.\nThere is just over a month to go before Disney Lorcana: Rise of the Floodborn cards hit the market, with a full release happening on December 1, 2023.

{"title": "The Bear Season 2's Worst Story Repeats The Show's Most Common Supporting Character Failure", "date": "2023-10-09 13:50:25", "text": "As great as The Bear is, it has a common problem with its supporting characters, and the worst story in season 2 takes that problem too far.\nThe Bear season 2 introduces Claire (Molly Gordon), a childhood friend of the Berzatto family, but she repeats the biggest problem with the show's supporting characters. The hit FX series follows Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), a well-respected chef who has worked in some of the world's best restaurants, as he attempts to turn his deceased brother's Chicago Italian beef sandwich shop into a fine-dining experience. Season 2 of The Bear introduced several new recurring roles, and these additions to The Bear cast of characters includes Luca (Will Poulter), Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis), Tiffany (Gillian Jacobs), and many others.\nOne of the key characters introduced in season 2, however, is Claire, a childhood friend of the Barzatto's whom Carmy used to have a crush on. When they meet in a grocery store, he forgets Claire's name, or at least pretends to. Following that, Carmy gives her a fake number, which also speaks to his self-destructive nature. However, after persistence, Claire becomes a part of Carmy's life, and they begin a serious relationship, something that Carmy certainly needs. Nevertheless, while it's great to see Carmy in a better place, Claire's position on the show repeats a tired The Bear supporting character trend.\nRELATED: 10 Unpopular Opinions About The Bear\nIn The Bear, all the love interests are just foils for the dramatic main characters. Carmy, Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Sugar (Abby Elliott) are all chaotic and short-tempered, and they find it hard to handle the stress that comes with financial burdens and running a kitchen. However, their other halves all provide them with a much calmer space and are ultimately stress relievers, but they're nothing more. Sugar's husband, Pete (Chris Witaske), is earnest and does everything he can to appease Sugar, even if the Berzatto family doesn't like him. Before his divorce, Richie was a lot more relaxed and almost a different person when around his wife, Tiffany (Jacobs).\nJust like those characters, Claire doesn't have much personality other than simply being calmer than Carmy. The Bear season 2's finale interestingly flips the dynamic on its head, as Carmy, while frustrated and locked in The Bear's kitchen freezer, says a number of insulting things about Claire that he doesn't mean. Claire overhears, then says goodbye to Carmy and leaves the kitchen before the credits roll. If Claire and Carmy get back together in The Bear season 3, the show will only double down on the tired romantic dynamic. While audiences want Carmy to be happy, Claire serves no other purpose than to settle the chef's nerves.\nRelated: 10 Most Unrealistic Things About The Bear\nThough The Bear season 3 story faces the challenge of overcoming this tired romantic dynamic, there's a clear way to fix it. Throughout two seasons, a romantic relationship between Carmy and Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) was subtly teased. This relationship could be totally different from the other couples and ex-couples on the show, as both Sydney and Carmy work in the kitchen, which could explore new dynamics. While part of what makes Carmy and Sydney's relationship in the first two seasons great is that it's a platonic boy-girl friendship, which is rarely seen, there's no doubt that the groundwork has been laid for an exciting romance, whether it works out or not.\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

{"title": "Cobra Kai Season 5 Confirmed The Sad Truth About Johnny Lawrence’s Story", "date": "2023-10-09 13:41:26", "text": "Cobra Kai season 5 made several intriguing developments in its overarching storyline but also revealed a sad truth about Johnny Lawrence's narrative.\nAs Cobra Kai season 5 sets the stage for the series' season 6 end game, a sad truth about Johnny Lawrence's story comes to light. Many factors contributed to Cobra Kai's success. However, the primary reason why the spin-off/reboot series works so well is that it has a solid reason to exist. According to reports, Ralph Macchio received pitches for several Karate Kid reboot and spin-off ideas. However, he declined them because they added little to no heft to the existing movie series' stories. Cobra Kai, however, was an exception because it not only complemented the original movie series' existing narrative but also showed the potential to create its own identity.\nBy making Johnny Lawrence an equally important character as Daniel LaRusso, Cobra Kai took the franchise in a refreshing direction. As a result, Johnny Lawrence, who was perceived as Daniel's evil bully in the original movie, became one of the most beloved characters in the franchise. William Zabka, too, deserves credit for adding new comical and emotional layers to Johnny Lawrence's characterization with his acting forte. However, despite making these subversions in its initial seasons, Cobra Kai is starting to reveal a tragic truth about its own limitations and Johnny Lawrence's overarching storyline.\nRELATED: Ralph Macchio's Reason For Returning As Daniel LaRusso After Almost 30 Years Is Exactly Why Cobra Kai Works\nCobra Kai was initially flipping the conventions followed by the original Karate Kid movies and unfolding from Johnny Lawrence's perspective. Unfortunately, it has not been doing the same in its recent seasons. To instill nostalgia in the long-term viewers of the franchise, Cobra Kai introduced characters like Chozen and Mike Barnes as Daniel's allies while marking the return of villains like Terry Silver. However, given how none of these characters were a part of the first Karate Kid movie, which featured Johnny Lawrence as one of its two main characters, the show has clearly started focusing on Daniel's side of the story instead of walking through Lawrence's rite of passage.\nJohnny Lawrence's overarching storyline has also gradually stagnated over time. Although the show has made some intriguing developments in his narrative by highlighting how he has gone from being an alcoholic loner to a family man, his characterization has hardly made any progress in the last couple of seasons. Lawrence's whole season 5 arc primarily revolved around him struggling to keep a job, which reinstated that he has not come too far since his season 1 story. Even though the show has been named after his karate fighting style, Cobra Kai, like the Karate Kid series, has gone back to emphasizing how the Miyagi way is the right way.\nEven when it comes to his relationship with Robby, Lawrence continues making the same mistakes in season 5. For instance, he lies to Robbie about the purpose of the Mexico trip and still has not wholeheartedly apologized to his biological son. While Lawrence's story arc barely progresses in season 5, Daniel LaRusso goes through a significant catharsis. After being an angry, resentful man throughout Cobra Kai season 5, Daniel realigns himself with Mr. Miyagi's philosophies by learning how \"everything be better\" when \"whole life have balance.\" This clearly made LaRusso season 5's main character.\nIn its initial seasons, Cobra Kai was more about Johnny Lawrence and Miguel than Daniel and every other character. Daniel, in fact, was portrayed as somewhat of an anti-hero in Cobra Kai season 1 who could not stand the idea of Johnny Lawrence doing better in life by teaching kids karate. The show even tried portraying Cobra Kai and its \"strike first, strike hard, no mercy\" philosophy in a neutral light by highlighting how it helped characters like Eli and Miguel fight their bullies and insecurities. This allowed Lawrence to truly shine as a sensei, paving the way for him to redeem himself.\nMiguel's All-Valley win further reinstates that Cobra Kai's primary focus was to flip the character beats set by the Karate Kid movies. John Kreese's introduction as the show's villain also played a crucial role in emphasizing that the series is about Lawrence since Kreese was a demon from his past. Although Daniel also perceived Kreese as his enemy, Johnny Lawrence had more of a love-hate relationship with his sensei, initially making him a vulnerable target for Kreese's manipulations.\nHowever, after Kreese ended up in prison towards the end of Cobra Kai season 4, the show hardly had anything more to add to Johnny Lawrence's narrative. Owing to this, Johnny Lawrence got demoted to being a secondary protagonist in Daniel LaRusso's Cobra Kai season 5 story. Considering how Johnny Lawrence and his role as a karate sensei is a mere subset of the Miyagi Do dojo after season 5 and Cobra Kai has been established as the dojo for the show's villains, it seems unlikely that Cobra Kai season 6 will promote Lawrence to his main character status from the earlier seasons.\nSince Daniel LaRusso's story and his dynamic with Mr. Miyagi set the foundation of the franchise's Miyagi verse, it is understandable why Cobra Kai had to eventually drift its focus back on the bona fide karate kid. While it is still commendable how Cobra Kai retconned the good vs. bad approach of the original series and took a more balanced approach towards portraying rivalries, most of the franchise's initial Karate Kid arcs were tied to Daniel LaRusso. Therefore, to maintain the sense of nostalgia that made the Netflix series so popular in the first place, Cobra Kai had to bring back players from LaRusso's past.\nJohnny Lawrence only appeared in the first Karate Kid movie, leaving the show with a limited pool of backstory to work with. Despite the decline in the franchise's quality after the second movie, Daniel remained the main character for three Karate Kid movies, leaving immense room for the franchise to expand his narrative in many new directions in Cobra Kai. However, even though it made narrative sense for Johnny Lawrence's storyline to take a backseat in Cobra Kai's recent season, it is hard not to hope that season 6 will balance his screen time with Daniel LaRusso's and give him the well-rounded redemption and closure he deserves.\n"}

The third-weekend takeaway also hits home just how extreme Expend4bles box office drop has been, as it was already reported that Expend4bles experienced a 69% drop for its second weekend. As a high-budget blockbuster and fourth entry in a major franchise, it is somewhat shocking that the movie can barely hold onto a $1 million gross less than a month into its theatrical run.\nThese box office trends cement Expend4bles as the lowest-performing film in The Expendables series. The series had already been trending downward before Expend4bles, for The Expendables 3 took home a somewhat-disappointing $214 million at the worldwide box office throughout its entire run, making it the lowest-grossing in the series before Expend4bles. Long gone are the days when The Expendables 2 brought the series $314 million.\nCouples with Expend4bles atrocious reviews, the box office fate does not bode well for the future of The Expendables franchise.

{"title": "Masters of the Universe Just Introduced Its Most Powerful Weapon Yet", "date": "2023-10-09 13:30:27", "text": "In Dark Horse's Masters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny #2, Skeletor obtains the Phlogista, the most powerful weapon on Eternia. \nWarning: contains spoilers for Masters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny #2!Masters of the Universe has introduced its most powerful weapon yet. Dark Horse Comics’ new Masters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny follows He-Man’s earliest days as well as his first run-ins with the evil Skeletor. In issue two, Skeletor heads to the island nation of Anwat Gar, and obtains a new weapon of unimaginable power, and not even He-Man may be able to stop him.\nMasters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny #2 is written by Tim Seeley and drawn by Eddie Nunez. Evil Lyn has secured an artifact called the Phlogista, which she refers to as “the most powerful ancient artifact in all of Eternia.” She covets it for herself and just as she reaches out to touch it, Skeletor arrives. Evil Lyn shows him the Phlogista, but he is unimpressed. She tells him that it is a magical metal that can be shaped to the user’s will. Skeletor is still not sold, but Evil Lyn informs him the Phlogista has ensured peace between the forces of Grayskull and Anwat Gar “simply by existing.”\nMasters of the Universe is set on the distant world of Eternia, a land where science and magic co-exist, which has led to the creation of some truly awesome weapons. He-Man’s sword, the magical weapon he uses to transform, is but one example. Some of these weapons are more science-based, including many of the vehicles He-Man and the Masters of the Universe use, such as the Attack Trak or the Dragon Walker, both of which are also featured in this issue. Yet all of these weapons seemingly pale in comparison to the Phlogista.\nThe issue only hints at the power of the Phlogista. Skeletor takes it and quickly departs. He is not seen for the rest of the issue, meaning readers will have to wait to see it in action. Yet what readers do learn about it is enough to establish that the Phlogista is not to be trifled with. According to Evil Lyn the metal can shape itself to whatever the user desires, meaning it could be changed into a variety of weapons. The only limit would be the user’s imagination. The most telling hint at the Phlogista’s power is that its mere existence ensures peace between two hostile territories.\nRelated: He-Man & Thundercats' Official Crossover Settled Whose Weapons are Better\nAnd now this weapon, a doomsday device, has fallen into Skeletor’s hands. Ironically, he does not seem impressed with it, at least on a surface level. Evil Lyn tries to caution him on its power, but he brushes her off. Previous issues of Forge of Destiny have established that Eternia has an equilibrium, and Skeletor as an outsider does not understand it, hence the reason he is doomed to fail in his plans of conquest. Because the Phlogista is an Eternian artifact, this may be the only saving grace for the Masters of the Universe, as its most powerful weapon now stands revealed.\nMasters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny #2 is on sale now from Dark Horse Comics!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "The 10 Greatest And Strangest Horror Movie Crossovers Ever", "date": "2023-10-09 13:30:27", "text": "Horror movie crossovers have dominated B-movie horror for generations, but not all crossovers were created equal. Some are brilliant, others are not.\nHorror movie crossovers have been produced for decades, but often vary wildly from the brilliant to the plain bizarre. While some have been met with critical acclaim, it is often the movies with seemingly the silliest premises and questionable critic reviews that are successful and spawn highly prosperous franchises. Nevertheless, horror crossovers have been a cinematic staple for years.\nThe horror genre has routinely sought to pair off iconic villains for an epic, spooky showdown. Beginning in early Hollywood with the Universal Classic Monsters, the trend has become a global phenomenon. From Frankenstein to Godzilla, most major horror icons have appeared in some form of crossover movie, some of which have endured longer than others.\nRELATED: Every Canceled Horror Vs. Crossover Movie (& Why They Didn't Happen)\n1942's Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman might be the first horror movie crossover ever. It depicted Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolfman consulting a descendant of Dr. Frankenstein, before invariably encountering the Monster. It was originally intended for Chaney to play both roles, having starred as the Monster in Son of Frankenstein, after Boris Karloff's retirement from the role. Interestingly, the part went to Bela Lugosi - who turned down the role of Frankenstein's Monster in the first Frankenstein movie. Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman is a fairly solid crossover, but its greatest feature is seeing two iconic horror actors share the screen.\nFollowing the success of Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, Universal Pictures released a series of \"Monster Rally\" films. The next was 1944's House of Frankenstein, which was quickly followed in 1945 with House of Dracula. House of Dracula featured Lon Chaney Jr. reprising his role as the Wolfman and John Carradine's second performance as Count Dracula. While its predecessors adequately justified combining Universal's iconic monster, House of Dracula offers a rather flimsy premise. It depicts Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolfman, each seeking a cure for their monstrous afflictions from a mad professor and a hunchback nurse. It is arguably the strangest and weakest of Universal's Monster Rally movies.\nTwo cult classics collided in 2015 when the bizarre crossover Lake Placid Vs. Anaconda was released by Syfy. After both Lake Placid and Anaconda received somewhat positive reviews, each series produced three sequels which garnered a cult following - largely because of their laughably poor CGI. This culminated in Lake Placid Vs. Anaconda, which sees an anaconda and a genetically modified crocodile escaping a laboratory to a nearby lake, where a group of sorority girls are partying. Unsurprisingly, the two behemoths battle, but not before gobbling up a few scantily-clad women. This quirky crossover also features a delightful performance from horror legend Robert Englund as mercenary Jim Bickerman.\nThe giant animal subgenre reached new heights in 2009 with Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. It was produced by the independent film company behind the Sharknado franchise, The Asylum. The Asylum is known for movies that lean fully into the so-bad-it's-good horror subgenre, which often enjoyed a cult following despite swathes of negative reviews. Indeed, Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus delivers precisely what it promises, two monstrously large, and unrealistic, CGI sea creatures battling, as a slew of hapless humans are caught in the middle. Amazingly, Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus spawned three sequels and established a Mega Shark franchise.\n2021's Godzilla vs. Kong portrayed two giants of cinema in conflict, but King Kong and Godzilla have actually been brawling since 1962. They first met in King Kong vs. Godzilla, and, despite facing each other multiple times since, this encounter remains a particular highlight. In fact, King Kong vs. Godzilla was so popular, that Japanese production company, Toho, released dozens of subsequent crossovers, some of which included multiple Kongs or even several different versions of Godzilla. Known as Toho's Kaiju universe, other crossovers have included the brilliant 1964 Mothra vs. Godzilla, right through to the strange, more recent renditions, like 1993's Godzilla vs. Mechgodzilla II.\nDespite starring Lon Chaney Jr. as a zombie called Groton, 1971's Dracula vs. Frankenstein is hailed as one of the worst movies to depict either monster. This is largely because the movie originally didn't feature either of them, and they were added to the plot after production had begun. As a result, their appearances are surreal and incongruous with the rest of the movie, which predominately seems dictated by opportunities to display female nudity. Dracula vs. Frankenstein would likely now be considered an exploitation movie, which is particularly evident by the fact that it is now distributed by trash-horror powerhouse, Troma Entertainment - the creators of The Toxic Avenger.\nOne of the strangest crossovers in horror movie history started as an April Fools' joke in 2015. It teased a crossover between the revered Japanese horror franchises Ringu and Ju-on (The Ring and The Grudge), proposing a clash between the movies' infamous villains. Audiences, however, were enthusiastic, and Sadako Vs. Kayako was released just 14 months later. While both the terrifying villains are highly regarded in their original movies, Sadako Vs. Kayako was comically inept at maintaining their legacy. Their performances were more akin to their Scary Movie parodies than the original Ringu or Ju-on, and it's unclear whether this is by accident or design.\nPossibly the most iconic horror showdown ever saw two slasher legends do battle in Freddy vs. Jason. Despite its lukewarm reception, Freddy vs. Jason has endured, and the performances delivered by the titular villains remain a highlight in each franchise. Robert Englund triumphantly returned to his most famous role as A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, depicted here manipulating Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees to torment the latest Elm Street children. Released in 2002, Freddy vs. Jason kick-started the modern horror crossover movement, leading to a string of imitations, and hopes of a sequel entitled Pinhead vs. Freddy vs. Jason.\nThe strangest horror crossover ever is surely the surreal horror comedy, Gingerdead Man vs. Evil Bong. Comedy horror luminary, Charles Band (known for Ghoulies and Re-Animator) combined two of his B-movie franchises, pitting the Gingerdead Man against Eebee, the evil bong. The former is a gingerbread recipe mix combined with the ashes of a dead serial killer, while the latter is a sentient, malevolent bong that ensnares stoners. It is exactly as weird as it sounds, but the impressive visuals and masterful balance between horror and comedy have garnered a huge cult fandom and led to the Gingerdead Man appearing as the primary antagonist in each subsequent Evil Bong movie.\nFollowing Freddy vs. Jason's success, two more horrifying villains clashed in 2004, in the horror movie crossover Alien vs. Predator. As a team of scientists investigates a mysterious alien pyramid, they find themselves caught in the crossfires of an ancient battle between the Xenomorphs of the Alien franchise, and the titular trophy hunters from the Predator movies. It is widely regarded as the greatest modern horror crossover, receiving favorable reviews, spawning an actualized sequel with Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, and further sequels within their respective franchises. Where some horror crossovers certainly fell flat, Alien vs. Predator truly demonstrated the potential of the horror subgenre.\n"}
{"title": "Frasier Reboot Reviews Are In — Does It Live Up To The Original Sitcom?", "date": "2023-10-09 13:29:02", "text": "Ahead of Kelsey Grammer's full return as the beloved elitist therapist, Frasier Crane, the reviews for the Frasier reboot have now been released. \nThe reviews for the Frasier reboot are in. In a few days, Kelsey Grammer will officially return as the elitist, but lovable therapist, Frasier Crane on the small screen. His comeback takes place almost two decades after he ended his stint in Seattle and hoped to start a new life with Charlotte in Chicago. Despite being both a critical and commercial success, getting the Frasier reboot off the ground was actually no easy feat, so it's curious if Grammer and co.'s efforts to bring the show back are worth it.\nAs the embargo lifts for Paramount+'s Frasier reboot, reviews from various outlets have now been released. Grammer is praised for easily slipping back into the shoes of his most iconic character. However, while it does a great job of evoking nostalgia, other elements of the new show simply don't live up to its predecessor.\nIt's quite a handicap, but Grammer knows the good doctor well, and he slips back into the role as easily as Frasier might don a bespoke Armani suit. The actor's exceptional charisma keeps this new Frasier afloat for now, but the five episodes made available for review reveal underlying issues that indicate it will not be an exception to the revival rule.\nKristen Baldwin, EW\nInstead of trying to reinvent the wheel of a legendary character, “Frasier” 2.0 leans toward everything that made the ’90s sitcom such a staple — not only of the era, but of the fabric of television as a whole. If fans are looking for something new, they won’t find it here, but there is something so charming about dusting off and polishing up a past relic that makes it as refreshing as you remembered it. And yes, Frasier wears jeans and Allbirds in the series because people can evolve, even if they don’t change completely.\nAramide Tinubu, Variety\nFilmed in front of a live studio audience, “Frasier” 2.0 rekindles the joy brought on by cunningly constructed lines delivered with perfect timing and attitude. This broadcast sitcom approach has withered since its late 20th century glory days, but such artificial artfulness can still satisfy in the streaming era.\nBob Strauss, Datebook\nUnlike the wretched reboot of Sex and the City, Frasier’s team has managed to update the comedy’s situation, incorporate Frasier’s greater age and its different challenges and diversify its casting without apparent strain. It feels like an organic progression rather than something flung together by a frightened committee.\nLucy Mangan, The Guardian\nThe fact that there is something to enjoy in this return to the Craniverse is testament to the joys of Cheers and Frasier, not to mention Grammer’s effective turn in the lead role. Little may remain other than a title and an endearing snobbery, but, just like Theseus’s ride before it, the spirit of Frasier remains intact. Not quite seaworthy, perhaps, but just about afloat.\nNick Hilton, Independent\nMuch as you’d expect from a decade-old shoe you’ve dug out the back of a cupboard, however, the new Frasier sometimes feels a little dated. The comedy and pacing is very ’90s sitcom, the laugh track even more so. But here’s the thing about nostalgia: It’s addictive AF. And so, once you get into the swing of it, we suspect you’ll be very glad that Frasier’s back in the building … even if it’s a different building in a different city. Cheers.\nKayleigh Dray, AV Club\nIn the Frasier reboot, Frasier moves back to Boston to fix his fractured relationship with his grown-up son, Freddy. Despite their rather great relationship in the original show, they apparently had a falling out in recent years, although it's unclear what it is about. Despite being already financially stable, Frasier appears to be taking a job at Harvard, where he reunites with his old friend, Alan Cornwall. Daphne and Niles' son, David will also be a regular player in the series. \nThe majority of the original characters will be absent in the Frasier reboot. David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves were invited to return as Niles and Daphne, but both turned down the project. Meanwhile, Bebe Neuwirth's Lilith and Peri Gilpin's Roz Doyle are confirmed to make cameos. Finally, in light of John Mahoney's passing in 2018, the new show is expected to pay homage to Martin Crane, especially since it will once again tackle a difficult father-and-son relationship. \nRelated: Frasier Recap: 10 Things To Remember Before The Reboot\nGiven the success of the original Frasier, the reboot has its work cut out for it. It's difficult to compete with its predecessor, particularly with its writing and ensemble. However, the fact that reviews are mostly good, although not great, should already be considered a win for the people involved. At the very least, it doesn't taint the original series' legacy. \nSource: Various (see links)\n"}
{"title": "Martin Scorsese Considers Whether Barbie & Oppenheimer Helped Save Cinema", "date": "2023-10-09 13:26:32", "text": "Martin Scorsese, who recently made comments about the concerning state of Hollywood, ponders Barbie and Oppenheimer's role in saving cinema.\nDirector Martin Scorsese debates whether Barbie and Oppenheimer helped revive cinema. Both released on July 21, Barbie and Oppenheimer’s simultaneous release was the biggest film event of 2023. Coined “Barbenheimer,” the concurrent release was helpful for both films; Barbie became the top grossing film of the year, coming in at a $1.4 billion gross, whereas Oppenheimer boasts a still-impressive $939 million worldwide box office gross.\nRelated: Why It Took Oppenheimer 6 Weeks To Beat Barbie At The Box Office\nScorsese pontificates on Barbenheimer’s role in saving cinema in a recent interview with Hindustan Times. In his interview, Scorsese admitted that he has yet to see either film, but has a respect for multiple members of their creative teams. In terms of the “combination of Oppenheimer and Barbie,” Scorsese believes that it was somewhat of a unique “perfect storm” as one could not have two more different films “work together” and gain such intertwined traction in the cultural zeitgeist. Ultimately, Scorsese thinks that “the most important thing is that people went to watch these in the theatre.” Check out the full quote from Scrosese below:\nI do think that the combination of Oppenheimer and Barbie was something special. It seemed to be, I hate that word, but the perfect storm. It came about at the right time. And the most important thing is that people went to watch these in a theatre. And I think that's wonderful.\nI haven't seen the films yet. I love Chris Nolan's work. Margot Robbie, I must say, started with me from The Wolf of Wall Street. Rodrigo Prieto (cinematographer), after finishing Killers of the Flower Moon, went on to shoot Barbie. So it's all in the family (laughs).\nThe way it fit perfectly - a film with such entertainment value, purely with the bright colours - and a film with such severity and strength, and pretty much about the danger of the end to our civilisation - you couldn't have more opposite films to work together. It does offer some hope for a different cinema to emerge, different from what's been happening in the last 20 years, aside from the great work being done in independent cinema. I always get upset by that, the independent films being relegated to ‘indies.’ Films that only a certain kind of people would like. Just show them on a tiny screen somewhere.\nThe director’s Barbie and Oppenheimer comments come after Scorsese recently spoke out about the need to “save cinema” from franchised superhero content. In this statement, Scorsese even pointed to Nolan as a way out of the “manufactured content” through a distinctive creative voice. These Barbenheimer comments add a layer of nuance to Scorsese’s cinema death fear. Scorsese is not averse to all mainstream content, but rather films that the director finds are shallowly produced and are not “giving you” anything genuine as an audience member.\nThis is not to say that Barbie and Oppenheimer’s successes are free from flaws. As has been pointed out, Hollywood has arguably taken the wrong message away from Barbie and Oppenheimer's successes. Since Barbie, Mattel has announced the development of numerous other toy-related films, including Polly Pocket, Hot Wheels, and Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. Considering Barbie’s landmark achievement of being the highest grossing female-directed film of all time, this toy-film obsession post-Barbie feels off base.\nOn an industry level, Barbie and Oppenheimer may not have caused the healthiest reaction from Hollywood. But as Scorsese alludes to, the Barbenheimer phenomenon did do something vital, which is bringing people back to the cinema in droves. Post pandemic, this revitalization has been especially important as theaters have been suffering for the past three years. Hopefully, those who returned for Oppenheimer and Barbie will continue to see the value in the theater and help the box office throughout the rest of the year of the movies.\nSource: Hindustan Times\n"}
{"title": "1 Karate Kid Song Was Originally Written For Rocky 3 (& Replaced By The Franchise's Biggest Hit)", "date": "2023-10-09 13:20:28", "text": "A huge score for The Karate Kid almost appeared in Rocky 3. Here's how the Rocky movie almost missed out on its biggest hit in the franchise.\nOne song from The Karate Kid was originally written for Rocky III, but it was replaced by the boxing franchise's biggest hit. Rocky III debuted in 1982 and saw a slightly more weary Italian Stallion (Sylvester Stallone) begrudgingly get in the ring with the younger, more antagonistic Clubber Yang (Mr. T) at the same time that his friend and mentor Mickey suffers a fatal heart attack. The Karate Kid, which would be released in 1984 and introduced the world to Ralph Macchio's plucky karate student Daniel and his sensei Mr. Miyagi's wise quotes, was in the early stages of development and didn't yet have a hook song to grab the audience.\nAt the time, it wasn't out of the ordinary for songs to be written by composers whose entire career consisted of optioning them to film studios during production without specifying how they would be used. Songs that might not have fit the tone or plot of one movie could be perfect for another, and so they were interchangeable. In the case of Rocky III, this song wouldn't have been appropriate, but it was perfect for The Karate Kid, and it was replaced by one that would eventually be arguably the biggest hit of the entire Rocky franchise, showing just how big a role chance plays in the process.\nThe signature song \"You're The Best\" by Joe Esposito was originally written for Rocky III prior to becoming attached to The Karate Kid. Sylvester Stallone passed on the song at the same time that The Karate Kid was in development, and it ended up fitting the tone of the film much better. While both films are about persevering in the face of obstacles and training hard to overtake adversaries, \"You're The Best\" doesn't really have the same bite as the song that Stallone eventually chose as the standout track on the Rocky III soundtrack.\nInstead of \"You're The Best,\" Stallone chose \"Eye Of The Tiger\" by Scorpion instead, which went on to become a huge hit. With its relentless guitar rifts and marching time signature, it was the perfect song to help Rocky \"go the distance\" and get in the ring with Mr. T's Clubber Yang. The film version of \"Eye of the Tiger\" is the demo, while the completely finished version appears on the soundtrack. While the theme song for Rocky 3 is technically \"Gonna Fly Now\" by Bill Conti, \"Eye Of The Tiger\" is definitely the song fans associate with not only the film, but the entire Rocky franchise.\nSomething similar happened again when Karate Kid 2's song was a Rocky IV reject. Peter Cetera's \"Glory of Love\" was originally going to be included in the film that saw the Italian Stallion go up against Ivan Drago, but it was passed over because it didn't fit Rocky triumphing against insurmountable odds. The soundtrack included James Brown's \"Living in America\", as well as \"Burning Heart\", and particularly John Caffery's \"Hearts on Fire,\" which provided the rousing anthem that played during Rocky's training sessions prior to the greatest fight of his career. \"Glory of Love\" became one of the biggest hits of The Karate Kid franchise.\n"}

Episode 5 ended with Daryl having to face down a zombie made faster and more aggressive by an injection from the Pouvoir. Isabelle and Laurent are also in danger, as Genet wants to use Laurent to bring the Union of Hope under her rule.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Zabel hinted that The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season finale will feature new information about Daryl's past not previously seen in the franchise. He also indicated the episode will feature many shocking moments by its end. Check out what Zabel had to say below:\nI'm so proud of the season finale. The season finale has it all. It has drama, it has tenderness, it has intense action, it has heroism, it has difficult moral choices. It excavates some of Daryl's past — some of which we're familiar with, but some of which is new information that we learn about him that refers to a lot of the things that the fans of the show will remember about his relationship with his brother and his family.\nSo it's a full payoff to the larger story of this epic journey through France, but it's also a full payoff to the intimate story of Daryl as this reluctant hero trying to just get back home. And it ends with a couple of moments that are pretty jaw-dropping.\nDaryl's past has been explored in the franchise before, with his spinoff in particular making many references to the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father when he was a child. It's likely this will be explored more in the season finale, given its prominence in the show so far. Since even The Walking Dead series finale revealed new information about how Merle forced a younger Daryl to give blood for money, it makes sense for more of Daryl's past to be unearthed in his titular show.\nThere are plenty of other plot developments likely to be addressed in the series finale as well. It appears Daryl, Isabelle, and Laurent will find a way to continue their journey to the Nest, all while being pursued by Codron. However, it's unclear whether or not the group makes it, or if something untoward happens beforehand.\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 also set up Carol's return while teasing a character from The Walking Dead came back to the Virginia communities. Whoever returned, it appears they will be integral to the story in the future, likely being revealed in season 2. With many ideas to focus on, it appears the season finale of Daryl's spinoff will be full of action, adventure, and mystery.\nSource: EW\n"}

The James Bond franchise has been part of the movie industry for over 60 years, and Connery was the first actor to bring its eponymous character to the big screen. He's also still considered by many fans to be the best 007 of all the actors who have played James Bond.\nThere are seven James Bond movies starring Sean Connery, six of which were official franchise installments made by EON Productions. He first left the series after five movies and decided he was done with the 007 role. After the sixth James Bond movie flopped, Connery changed his mind and agreed to come back for Diamonds Are Forever. He then hung up his tuxedo again before returning a decade later for a non-EON movie as James Bond.\nRelated: Every James Bond Movie Ranked From Worst To Best\nBy the time the James Bond franchise had reached its fifth movie, You Only Live Twice, Sean Connery had become bored with his famous role. The actor had become synonymous with James Bond by this point, and he was worried about being typecast in future films. Connery was also fed up with the fame and pressure that came with playing such an iconic character. During the filming of You Only Live Twice, he was hassled by photographers and pursued by unrelenting fans, which only angered him further.\nConnery also didn't have a good relationship with the James Bond franchise's producers and was not happy with his salary of $750,000 plus 25 percent of merchandising for the fifth film. He made it known to EON Productions, the company in charge of the franchise, that he wanted a $1 million salary for the sixth movie. When his request was refused, Connery decided he was done with the James Bond role, and he was replaced by George Lazenby for 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, it was clear that the James Bond franchise was in trouble. George Lazenby left the role after his sole appearance as lead of the franchise, and recasting Bond was up in the air. Producers decided to ask Sean Connery to return for the next film, offering him a salary of $1.25 million to re-star in the franchise. Totally won over by this offer, Sean Connery agreed to return as James Bond in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. He used his salary from the film to establish the Scottish International Education Trust.\nDiamonds Are Forever proved to be a turning point for the James Bond franchise and gave hope for more movies. But despite being offered a salary of $5.5 million to reprise the role again, Sean Connery turned down Live and Let Die, which instead debuted Roger Moore as James Bond in 1973. Connery made it clear that after playing 007 six times, he’d had enough, telling the screenwriter that his \"obligation to play James Bond\" had to end at some point. \nConnery gave his successor, Roger Moore, his approval and labeled him “the perfect Bond” to carry on the James Bond franchise. Yet one decade later, Connery made one more return to the part of James Bond, this time for an unofficial, non-canon 1983 installment, which competed against Moore's own Bond movie of the same year. That final Connery Bond movie's title, Never Say Never Again, perfectly reflected the actor's tumultuous relationship with the James Bond franchise throughout his career.\nEidhne Gallagher is a Movie and TV Features Writer, living in Ireland.

With no other choice, Superman ultimately settles down on a planet and starts a new life.\nUnfortunately, this new planet - which Clark calls 'Kansas' - isn't stable, and begins to collapse, just like Krypton did.

Those who truly love the genre can say that nothing scares them, but it's definitely a little unnerving to watch a scary movie while home alone - especially at night or with the lights off. The best horror movies to watch with friends are familiar slashers or a fresh story that invites discussion.

That might mean a B-movie known for an outlandish plot, or it might mean watching a horror film from another country to see how it differs from the mainstream. Those who love horror will also love to watch more meta horror movies with friends to recognize the different tropes of the genre. Modern horror has definitely taken a more meta approach to slashers since the 1990s, but there is still a wealth of horror movies to watch in a group out there.\nRELATED: The Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nSome people want to watch horror movies with their friends so that they’ll have someone around when the movies get a little too scary to handle. Others want friends around so they can dissect the movies and discuss what makes them great (or what makes them so bad they’re good). Killer Clowns From Outer Space falls into the latter category.\nThe movie didn’t get great reviews when it was released in 1988, but it’s become a cult classic. It features a group of alien creatures that look like clowns attempting to invade Earth. Nearly all the effects in the movie are practical, making it unique among modern horror, and the unique premise gives the movie some fascinating visuals. A sequel has also been stuck in development since the movie first hit theaters.\nGrabbers is less of a typical slasher or psychological horror and more like a classic monster flick. It’s an Irish film set on a remote Irish island, allowing the story to truly be immersed in the setting.\nHorror events are set off when dead whales start washing up on shore. The local police officer in charge, who happens to be an alcoholic, isn’t all that interested in events, but his new partner is. The two have to team up when it becomes apparent that tentacled monsters are responsible and are now attacking the residents. Surprisingly, the way to battle the monsters seems to be getting really drunk since alcohol is toxic to them. That solution creates a hilarious take on a B-movie horror plot as the characters have to keep their wits about them to battle the monsters while they’re drinking as much as they can.\nIf a group of friends are getting together to watch horror movies, it seems impossible to not take a look at Scream. The 1996 movie is what pushed a meta take on horror in the slasher genre as more fans became aware of the tropes the movies used to tell their stories. Scream uses those tropes incredibly effectively.\nSidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends are attacked by a killer who becomes known as the Ghostface in the first installment of the franchise. If horror fans want to really have a meta-fest for the slasher genre, they should stick with Scream and watch its five sequels. Each sequel evolves with the conventions of the genre, pointing out how slashers change and influence pop culture. They make for great discussion starters.\nRELATED: Most Iconic Ghostface Quotes\nModern Japanese horror that managed to cross over to American audiences includes movies like The Grudge and The Ring. House, however, is a more classic Japanese horror film with a much more surreal take on the genre.\nA group of Japanese girls end up in a country house and have to fight off evil spirits. The visuals in the movie are incredibly unique, and it’s got a great combination of nightmare-like horror as well as comedic elements to lighten the tension It’s definitely a fun ride for horror fans who want to expand their horizons outside the typical US movies.\nIt’s well known that slasher flicks all have a “final girl” that survives to the end. Some of the most famous final girls in pop culture are those in horror classics like Halloween (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Scream (Neve Campbell). The Final Girls takes that idea of an actress being known for her horror status as a final girl and creates a new meta take on horror.\nIn the movie, a young woman (Taissa Farmiga) and her friends attend a fan screening of a horror film her mother is known for while she’s still grieving the loss of her mom. The group finds themselves unwittingly sucked into the events of the movie and trying to survive the 1980s horror tropes it involves. It’s both hilarious and heartfelt and a love letter to horror fans that will allow a group of horror-loving fans to discuss all the ways it examines the genre.\nSince Hereditary is one of the most popular horror movies of the past few years, many horror fans will recommend that friends watch it together, but Don't Look Now might be a more unique option for fans of the genre.\nThere are many movies that inspired Hereditary, including Don't Look Now, and a group of friends could watch both movies for an entertaining and terrifying night in. The movie follows the story of Laura and John, who are grieving the loss of their daughter Christine. They meet people in Venice who say that they can help them contact her spirit. Both movies are about ghosts, religion, and family.\nRELATED: 10 Best Horror Movies About Grief\nHost is also a great pick for a horror movie to watch with friends. Chief among the reasons is because it's not too long of a movie. Horror movies that drag on for too long can have difficulty holding the attention of a group that might do more talking and less watching.\nThere's a lot to discuss with Host, as the main characters talk on Zoom and start realizing that something evil is happening. The movie is relatable as a group who is staying in touch virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and the friends start being killed by a spirit. Because so many people relied on Zoom to work and stay connected in 2020, it's definitely a modern horror movie that will resonate with the audience.\nIn the 2007 movie [Rec], a journalist named Ángela learns about something awful happening in an apartment building and goes to cover the story. It turns out that the people living there have been taken over by demons and turned into what seem to be zombies.\nIt's a great take on the found footage subgenre of horror. While some horror fans will find it fun, others will find it genuinely frightening. A group of horror fans will definitely have both in the mix, making it a great horror movie to watch with friends who might all get something different out of the movie.\nRELATED: The 10 Best Found Footage Movies, According To Letterboxd\nA movie night with friends calls for a story that is pure joy to watch and also includes some funny moments, which is when a fun horror comedy movie is in order. Horror fans and people who prefer comedies will both love this story of how college students believe that Tucker and Dale are going to hurt them, and the duo is clueless about what to do next.\nIt's also best to watch this movie with some of the group of friends not already familiar with Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil. That way, at least some of the group won't know what to expect, making it particularly fun for them, but just as fun for those who already know the story to see their reactions.\nThe Blair Witch Project is definitely a movie that inspires a great discussion as people can talk about how it was marketed as a true story of students staying in the woods and filming themselves finding a supernatural presence. It's one of the movies that ushered in found footage in the 2000s.\nIt makes for a great discussion among friends watching horror as well as taking a look at other projects inspired by it. Even the teen series Dawson's Creek did an episode inspired by the movie in which the friends went to an island that was said to be haunted.\nA Nightmare On Elm Street is a staple of teen horror movies. It's the kind of horror movie that even those who aren't overly familiar with the genre might enjoy. If a group of friends are getting together to watch horror movies, and they aren't all horror fans, A Nightmare On Elm Street is a good place to start.\nIt's a creative story that still employs a lot of the teen slasher tropes, allowing for a great introduction to horror. While Freddy Krueger kills a lot of people, A Nightmare on Elm Street is still a fun and enjoyable horror movie that works well whether someone is a huge fan of the genre or not.\nWhile some people in a friend group might love terrifying horror movies, others might want something a bit more entertaining than scary. That's where The Legend Of Boggy Creek comes in.\nThe movie is actually similar to the legend of Bigfoot and other cryptids. It's a slower paced horror movie with a little campiness to it instead of violence. Like The Blair Witch Project, this movie says that it really happened and that the Fouke Monster, who is like Bigfoot, is real. Just the discussion of whether the cryptid exists could make for fun party talk.\nThe Cabin in the Woods would be a great horror movie to watch with friends. It's a meta take on the horror genre, but one in which the tropes are turned on their heads. There are also a ton of Easter eggs for fans of the horror genre and for fans of Joss Whedon's earlier work.\nRELATED: 10 Things You Didn’t Know About The Cabin In The Woods On Its 10th Anniversary\nFriends can chat about the wild reveals in this movie, the astonishing monsters, and how some characters can spot the evil in the seemingly picturesque cabin and others have no idea what's about to happen. It's great to watch The Cabin in the Woods with other fans of scary films as everyone can discuss their favorite character and who they are rooting for the most.\nWhile there are some great slasher movie franchises, there are also some stand-alone films that have made a big impression. You're Next is one of those standalone movies.\nIt makes for a great horror movie to watch with friends because it combines many of the best elements of the slasher genre into a unique story. It's the kind of horror movie that makes the audience really root for the main character, but it also features plenty of jump scares and funny moments that will keep the audience watching. Fans will like seeing how Erin handles the scary situation that's in front of her as she goes to her boyfriend's family reunion and discovers killers in animal masks.\nLoan officer Christine (Alison Lohman) sees her life become a horrifying ride when a woman wants more time to pay her mortgage and Christine says no. The movie is incredibly intense and keeps people guessing, which makes it a good choice to watch with a group of people who can discuss it afterward.\nFor horror fans who have already seen the movie, they'll surely have an interesting discussion about the theory that Christine isn't actually in the middle of a horror story, but hallucinations induced by an eating disorder. Theories like that one that allow horror fans to see past the scary moments make for fascinating takes on beloved stories.\nCoherence has a mystery that would be great to unpack with other people after watching, as several friends enjoy dinner together and the power goes out. The characters are certain that something is off here, and they end up being right.\nA dinner party is a perfect setting for a scary movie as the characters are expecting a calm gathering, and instead get quite the opposite. The movie maintains a good, unsettling tone, and it's fun seeing how it reveals its secrets. Horror fans can try to guess what's happening, which would make it even more entertaining.\nSince many horror fans count Get Out as a favorite, it would be compelling to watch it knowing what danger Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) will be in when he visits his girlfriend's parents. Friends can talk about the well-crafted film and the clues that are present throughout the story, as it's clear that something is wrong from the moment that Chris and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are seen driving through the country.\nThere will definitely be differences in discussion between those who have already seen the movie and those who haven't. A group of friends who haven't all already seen it might be hard to find considering the movie's popularity though.\nReady Or Not is definitely a good pick for a group looking for a horror film that manages to feel both terrifying and also light-hearted. Grace Le Domas (Samara Weaving) is forced to play a lethal game of hide and seek with the family that she married into just hours before, and while she can be killed, the movie maintains a sense of humor.\nTyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin directed both Ready or Not and Scream (2022) and both films show their humorous and vibrant approach to the horror genre. Grace may be in danger, but the family is so silly that it's hard not to laugh and know that she will be okay.\nWhile Skeleton Key, starring Kate Hudson, might seem a bit corny, it's perfect when people are looking for a lighter kind of horror movie that isn't going to be disturbing. Caroline Ellis (Hudson) begins working at a dilapidated mansion as she's an aide, and she learns of a paranormal ritual that is connected to the house.\nRELATED: 10 Kate Hudson Movies, Ranked (According To Rotten Tomatoes)\nThere are a lot of supernatural movies, but this one is distinct as it involves hoodoo, and while some horror fans might say that this is an unrealistic film, others will enjoy sitting back and going on this journey with Caroline.\nDirected by Yeon Sang-ho, Train to Busan tells the tale of people taking a train journey when zombies appear, and it makes for a great horror movie to watch with friends - especially before it gets its American remake.\nThe train setting makes Train to Busan stand out when compared to other films about the apocalypse, and since the characters are stuck, that brilliantly makes the stakes higher. Audiences will root for the characters and friends can discuss how they can escape. Discussions of what friends would do in a similar situation are certainly something horror fans can enjoy while watching any of these movies.\nAya Tsintziras is a Senior Writer at Screen Rant who enjoys writing about TV and movies.

{"title": "Martin Scorsese Explains How Lily Gladstone Became The Heart Of Killers Of The Flower Moon", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "Killers of the Flower Moon counts on Lily Gladstone's Mollie for its heart, and filmmaker Martin Scorsese breaks down why she was so integral.\nWhile Killers of the Flower Moon may focus on the villainous actions of William K. Hale (played by Robert De Niro) and his associates, Martin Scorsese's latest epic also calls for empathy and understanding for the Native Americans who suffered at their hands. Based on David Grann's nonfiction book of the same name, the movie follows the murders of several members of the Osage Nation in the 1920s and the systems that allowed the killers to continue unabated for so long. Lily Gladstone, who plays Mollie Burkhart, has emerged as a standout both due to her character's resilience in the face of tragedy and her own powerhouse performance.\nWhile at a global press conference for the movie, Screen Rant asked Scorsese about the importance of Lily Gladstone's character in Killers of the Flower Moon and how he worked with her to achieve the right balance. The acclaimed director then explained how his take on the story grew from spending time with the Osage people and building on the very real yet complicated love story between Ernest (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie, as well as how Gladstone contributed to making her character more of a focus. Read his full answer below:\nMartin Scorsese: The key to Mollie that I discovered from visiting and spending some time with the Osage in Pawhuska and Gray Horse [is that] a lot of the people still are related to many of the people in the story. A lot of the families still still exist, of course. Rather than victimization — to make it simplified, so that we can accept that because we've seen that, and it makes it less threatening to those of us in power, so to speak — [I wanted] to actually get to the person.\nAnd the person was interesting to me, because not only was she a resistor, as they called her; a person who was resisting the new ways, which were destroying the culture. But she also was very sharp; very intelligent. And the key was that she was actually — from what I understand — in love with Ernest, and he was in love with her. They have this love story, and yet he is helping other people kill her sisters. He may be poisoning her; all of this going on. We were fascinated by how they stayed together. Not necessarily why they stayed together. In love, there's no why. That's we wanted to explore; the love and the trust, the betrayal and then still the love until finally she has to leave him. She left him after the trial in reality. That's our story. The heart of the story was her. That developed that way, all the way through.\nLily kept adding. She had a good relationship with Leo. I think you could see it in the scene where he's driving the cab, and she's in the backseat, and she's saying things in Osage. He says, \"I don't know what you just said, but it must be Indian for handsome devil.\" She starts laughing; that's a total improv. And that really hit it — from that moment on, they took off, trusting each other, working together, and enjoying each other too.\n Killers of the Flower Moon intentionally follows the perspective of the murderers, but Mollie's proximity to them highlights the senselessness of their actions even more. She and Ernest fall in love even as he plots with his uncle to destroy her family for the sake of their oil rights, which requires Gladstone to thread a thin line between being gullible to his charms and being a strong and savvy woman in her own right. Scorsese's insight into the relationship between Gladstone and DiCaprio's characters is part of what makes the movie stand out beyond its depiction of an American travesty.\nRelated: Killers Of The Flower Moon: Release Date, Trailer, Cast, Story & Everything We Know\nFurthermore, Gladstone is tasked with being one of the sole Native American viewpoints in a story about atrocities committed against the Osage Nation. Although Killers of the Flower Moon improved its Native representation after script revisions, Gladstone is still the primary personal connection between the white settler scam artists and their victims. The pain she endures as her sisters die one by one is magnified by the fact that the only person she can trust is her husband, whom the audience knows is the very person perpetrating the unconscionable acts against her family.\nGladstone recently wowed audiences in Fancy Dance, where her impeccable performance shed light on the harsh reality faced by many Native women. In Killers of the Flower Moon, she is once again able to give voice to a previously silenced population and bring an overlooked story to the forefront. De Niro and DiCaprio may be the names audiences know when they enter the theater, but Gladstone will be who they remember when they leave it.\n"}
{"title": "Marvel's Original Plan For The Skrulls Was Repeatedly Upset By Legal Problems", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "Before the MCU’s Phases 3, 4, and 5 delved deeper into the Skrulls, Marvel had another plan for the aliens that was constantly ruined by legal issues.\nBefore Secret Invasion offered a showcase for the green, shape-shifting Marvel aliens, the MCU had a different plan for the Skrulls that was repeatedly upset by legal issues. Throughout the MCU's Infinity Saga and the beginning section of the Multiverse Saga, the Skrulls have only been focused on with any real detail in two projects. The first of these was Captain Marvel, the 2019 film centered on the titular heroine navigating the complex politics of a Kree-Skrull war before figuring out the latter people were simply displaced refugees whose image had been shattered and skewed by the propaganda of a tyrannical empire.\nThis then led to Secret Invasion, a continuation of Captain Marvel's story that continued explaining Marvel Comics’ Skrulls differently. In the show, the Skrulls were still searching for somewhere to call home. This time, the story centered on Nick Fury battling against Gravik, a radicalized Skrull hellbent on taking Earth as his home due to decades of false promises, displacement, and overall oppression by the people of the cosmos. While promising, the execution of Marvel's Secret Invasion fell flat and would have been improved if Marvel's original plans for the Skrulls that were crippled by legal problems had come to fruition.\nWhile the MCU may have plans for Secret Invasion's lingering plot threads in upcoming Marvel Disney+ shows, it is worth exploring the set-up for the story to get to the heart of Marvel Studios' initial plan. Surprisingly, the first tease of the MCU's Skrulls came as far back as 2013. After the successful release of 2012's The Avengers, Marvel TV began developing a spin-off TV show with Avengers director Joss Whedon on board. This idea spiraled into Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, a show that ran for seven seasons and essentially established its own continuity that has led to the long debate of whether Agents of SHIELD is Marvel canon.\nDespite this debate, the MCU show's earlier seasons were certainly deemed so with strong connections to movies like The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Interestingly though, Agents of SHIELD's first season held connections to the Skrulls, therefore linking to 2019's Captain Marvel rather than the aforementioned projects that were released in a similar time frame in 2013. These connections were first teased in Agents of SHIELD season 1, episode 4, \"Eye Spy.\"\nIn this episode, the story sees the titular agents travel to the Todorov Building, a research facility in Belarus. As they enter, a chalkboard can be seen adorning one of the sets. On this chalkboard, an alphabet is written in Skrull language that was taken directly from Marvel Comics. This proves to be the first canonical reference - canon status of the show notwithstanding - to the Skrulls in the MCU, proving just how far back Marvel Studios began setting up the green, shape-shifting aliens of the universe.\nAfter this fun MCU Easter egg linked to the Skrulls in Agents of SHIELD, Marvel Studios began implementing other ways to foreshadow the alien race in the MCU. That said, these numerous plans fell through concerning legal issues surrounding the rights to the Skrulls and their usage. Before 20th Century Fox was acquired by Disney, the studio co-owned the rights to several Marvel Comics characters with Marvel Studios. Some of these included the likes of Quicksilver - explaining why the speedster appeared in both Fox's X-Men franchise and Avengers: Age of Ultron as two different versions - and Scarlet Witch.\nAnother of these co-owned Marvel properties was the Skrulls, meaning either 20th Century Fox or Marvel Studios could utilize the alien race on film. That said, some individual members of the Skrull race were wholly owned by 20th Century Fox including a major Skrull character named KI'rt, the original Super-Skrull. Given that Secret Invasion dealt with the concept of Super-Skrulls, setting this idea up between 2013 and 2019 - the latter year being when Disney could begin using Fox-owned properties after the acquisition - would not have been possible.\nIn light of this impossibility, several MCU plans to include the Skrulls fell through due to the legal issues involved with tying the aliens into an overarching story. While the Skrulls in a broader sense could have been included in various Marvel projects, they could not have been tied to any larger story given that Skrull characters with any import from Marvel Comics were owned by another studio. This meant that, despite the first tease of the Skrulls coming in 2013 with Agents of SHIELD, no other Easter eggs, references, or connections to the aliens amounted to anything until 2019's Captain Marvel after the Fox-Disney merger had taken place.\nAs is known from the state of Marvel Studios' Phase 5 of the MCU, these legal issues were completely resolved after the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney. This meant that Super-Skrulls and other major storylines involving the aliens could finally be used as evident with 2023's Secret Invasion. That said, the show was a disappointment to many due to its low production value despite an inflated budget, lack of consequences, absence of wider MCU connections, and the waste of the premise that promised a big storyline for the Skrulls like the comic run of the same name from Marvel Comics.\nConcerning the poor reception of Secret Invasion, the original Skrull plans that fell through for Marvel between 2013 and 2019 could have improved, and even saved, the Phase 5 show centering on the shape-shifters. Initially, it was thought that the Skrulls would be the villains of 2012's The Avengers with some merchandising even featuring the aliens before the film's release. However, this proved not to be the case with director Joss Whedon offering his reasoning for the Chitauri being the villainous army invading New York under Loki's rule in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.\nHowever, the Skrulls being the primary villains of Phase 1 of the MCU alongside Loki would have benefited Secret Invasion by setting up their warmongering ways. While the MCU eventually chose a different direction with the Skrulls in Captain Marvel, perhaps the set-up of some Skrulls being bloodthirsty invaders while others are simply displaced refugees almost 10 years before Secret Invasion could have provided more context to the Phase 5 story. Furthermore, an interview with IGN in 2017 confirmed that James Gunn, writer-director of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, had plans for the Skrulls in his first two MCU films.\nGunn confirmed that he has always had a fondness for the Skrulls and their Marvel Comics stories when he was asked about Captain Marvel's usage of the alien race. Gunn stated that he had looked at ways to use the Skrulls in the first two Guardians movies that \"didn't work out for one reason or another.\" The cosmic connections between the Guardians films and Captain Marvel could have provided some backstory and history of the Skrulls before their introduction in the latter film, subsequently aiding how they were used in Secret Invasion and improving that show as a result.\nFinally, the last failed plan for the Skrulls was connected to another 2019 film: Spider-Man: Far From Home. The Skrulls were used to an extent in this film though not as centrally as Captain Marvel when it was revealed that Nick Fury and Maria Hill had been Skrull impostors throughout the entire film. This certainly conceptually teased Secret Invasion and the idea that any Marvel character could be a Skrull, though was not focused on in any major way that had much relevance to Far From Home's plot.\nRelated: Marvel Did Secret Invasion Already 7 Years Ago And It Was Way Better\nIn an interview with Variety, Spider-Man: Far From Home's writers Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna confirmed that early versions of the film's script involved the Skrulls much more heavily than the final product. This was dropped by director Jon Watts in an attempt to reduce the amount of plot twists featured in the project. This was later further detailed in an interview with Collider when McKenna and Sommers stated that, in very early drafts of the film, the main villain Mysterio would have been a Skrull character.\nThis plot twist, and the general idea of including more Skrulls in a way that affected the plot, would have definitely improved Secret Invasion. While again, the reveal of Fury and Hill as Skrulls adequately teased the concept of Skrull impostors on Earth, the lack of relevance the reveal had on the plot was a misfire. If a Skrull impostor had an integral impact on Far From Home's plot, the idea of Secret Invasion's anxiety-inducing impostor story would have been enhanced. Unfortunately, none of these plans from Marvel made it to film or TV, proving Secret Invasion's weaknesses and the impact legal issues had on the Phase 5 TV show.\n"}
{"title": "The Blair Witch Project's Filming Conditions Sound Scarier Than The Actual Movie", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "In addition to its found-footage format, the authentic feel of The Blair Witch Project can be attributed to the movie's disturbing working conditions.\nThe 1999 release of The Blair Witch Project was a game-changer for horror cinema, but the behind-the-scenes story of its production and filming conditions is scarier than the movie itself. The Blair Witch Project helped to set a trend with found footage movies, inspiring a new wave of popularity for the horror subgenre. At the time, the found footage concept was so unique that audiences believed The Blair Witch Project was a true story.\nThe Blair Witch Project follows three film students who disappear after heading into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the titular local legend. The movie is told through the students' camera footage, and it was filmed with a Hi8 camcorder and a 6mm camera, giving it a realistic POV feel as the found footage format effectively immerses viewers in the experience. However, The Blair Witch Project's authentic feel is as much due to the actors' experiences behind the scenes as the footage itself.\nRelated: Blair Witch Project Ending Explained - All Your Questions Answered\nThe production of The Blair Witch Project was a harrowing experience for its cast. To achieve authenticity, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez sent inexperienced actors into the wilderness to fend for themselves. According to Vice, the actors camped out for eight days with minimal guidance while filming. They were given GPS trackers to locate shooting spots and provided limited food rations to provoke irritability. The filmmakers intentionally made noise in the woods at night to increase the actors' fear and exhaustion. Directors escalated their interference throughout the eight days, which is evident in the increasing impatience and desperation seen in the film.\nIn order for The Blair Witch Project to be genuinely terrifying, the film needed to come across as authentic. To achieve this, the filmmakers required amateur actors to immerse themselves in their roles fully. To further enhance the realism, the actors' real first and last names were used in the film. It was important that these actors were new to the film industry and unrecognizable. Their lack of experience also contributed to a more authentic performance, as they had no basis for comparison. Overall, their inexperience played a crucial role in creating the realistic appearance of the film, which led to it becoming a phenomenal hit at the box office.\nRelated: Every Blair Witch Project Movie Ranked, Worst to Best\nOne of the most influential horror films of the 20th century, The Blair Witch Project inspired movies such as Paranormal Activity, REC, and V/H/S. Due to its success, The Blair Witch Project released a sequel in 2000, and a remake of the original was made in 2016. These subsequent films failed to capture the authenticity and chilling essence of the original. Although some of the filming tactics used may seem extreme and even cruel, it is evident that the directors recognized the significance of eliciting authentic reactions and emotions from the actors. Whether or not the filmmakers went too far is open to debate, but the outcome was undoubtedly flawless.\nSource: Vice\n"}
{"title": "10 Coolest Outfits & Costumes In Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "Assassin's Creed Mirage features a number of awesome outfits and costumes; however, some are so much cooler and visually interesting than others.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage represents a concerted effort by developer Ubisoft to return this once immensely popular franchise back to its beloved roots. In spite of abandoning the controversial RPG-style gameplay of the past several entries in the Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed Mirage maintains an impressive array of customization options - most significantly in the character aesthetic department. Though the latest installment in the series has a limited supply of unique outfits and costumes when compared with previous installments, the developer has evidently elected to value quality over quantity as the vast majority of Assassin's Creed Mirage's apparel options are exceptionally well-designed - though, inevitably, some are so much better than others.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nSet in ninth-century Baghdad, Assassin's Creed Mirage is a relative tour de force and a remarkable return to the franchise's long-lost glory; although it is not perfect, it certainly rectifies many of the mistakes of past games. A core component of any Assassin's Creed game is the ability to customize the protagonist's appearance - and in this department, Assassin's Creed Mirage really shines. The apparel customization options available to the player fall into two categories — outfits and costumes — though outfits offer Basim Ibn Ishaq invaluable perks, the game's numerous costumes should not be overlooked as they are visually excellent.\nRelated:Assassin's Creed Mirage Ending Explained (In Detail)\nThe Sand Outfit is only available in-game as part of the DLC that comes as part of the Deluxe Edition of Assassin’s Creed Mirage - a fact made even more disappointing by its inclusion of the valuable perk Second Chance. A perk ensures that Basim can survive a lethal hit per combat and temporarily slow down time once during a battle. The outfit is visually interesting, with white pants, tan leather riding boots, and an effortlessly stylish loose-flowing long fabric tied around Basim's waist. Whilst the outfit lacks significant abdomen coverage, it does contain wrist guards and a leather strap over the shoulder and chest.\nComing with perhaps the greatest perk of any outfit in Assassin's Creed Mirage, Silent Blade, the Initiate of Alamut outfit, although the apparel Basim wears from the start of his time as an Assassin, is one of the coolest outfits in the game. The Initiate of Alamut outfit is dominated by a two-tone full-body light-fabric gown which, although airy, appears to be well tailored to Basim's body. Beyond this, the outfit features a matching shawl and near-ubiquitous dark leather boots, wrist wraps, and waist protection. Even if this understated aesthetic does not impress, the perk certainly will, as it lessens the noise emitted by Basim during assassinations.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nObtaining the Hidden One Outfit is fairly easy; it is located on the roof of the Shurta Headquarters in the Round City, which, although heavily defended, should not pose an insurmountable challenge. The outfit is not the most cohesive of designs; however, it is thematically appropriate given the setting. Featuring a shawl scarf concealing Basim's head and obscuring his face, as well as ornately designed greaves and gauntlets, the outfit of the Hidden One is visually interesting. The highlight of the design, however, is the complex belt/waist protection, which is reminiscent of a number of classic Assassin's Creed designs.\nAlthough costumes are purely cosmetic and lack any innate perks or abilities, some costumes, such as the Treasure Hunter Costume, certainly make up for this. Obtained by completing the \"Dervis’ Shop\" side quest, the Treasure Hunter Costume appears as though it would be a perfect choice for someone searching for treasure in a desert. With a long-flowing, light-fabricated tunic, and matching shawl scarf, as well as added protection for the shoulders, wrists, waist, and legs, the Treasure Hunter Costume is thematically perfect for a desert environment. Although subtle, it is one of the coolest costumes in the game.\nThe costume of a scholar in the House of Wisdom, the Scholar Costume, is the perfect choice for an assassin planning on masquerading as a man of learning. This ornately designed costume features a robe similar to a short Mufti, with an intricate arab-eqsue design. Beyond this, it also contains a thick waist wrap and a shawl tied in a manner reminiscent of a turban. The composition of this design is stunning; every component compliments the rest, resulting in an elegant yet battle-ready design. The Scholar Costume is obtained after completing the side quest given by Al-Jahiz's in which Basim locates a number of lost books.\nThe outfit of a Zanj rebel is possibly the most complex to locate and acquire in Assassin's Creed Mirage - it is also a time-consuming process to upgrade. Despite this, the aesthetic certainly justifies the effort of obtaining it. The Zanj Uprising outfit is cosmetically simple but a perfect look for the medieval sandy setting. It is dominated by what appears to be a single piece of fabric that is manipulated into a shawl that extends down Basim's body all the way to his knees. Accompanying this is a vibrant red waistband and a golden scarf descending from the waist - overall, this is a very satisfying composition.\nAlthough it comes with a disappointingly poor perk in Lick Your Wounds, the Abbasid Knight Outfit is one of the better cosmetic options in Assassin's Creed Mirage. The outfit, although perhaps cumbersome for an assassin, features a long white tunic, as well as an ornately designed brass Cuirass, helmet, greaves, and a pair of gauntlets. The combination of light-flowing fabric and sturdy metal armor is a perfect metaphor for the agile yet powerful Basim — beyond this subtextual analysis, the design is simply brilliant and undoubtedly one of the coolest in the latest installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise.\nThe attire of a merchant who comes from the Far East can be purchased from Shopkeepers for 500 Dirham after beginning the quest “Baghdad Bound.” The Far East Merchant Costume is one of the most elaborate in Assassin's Creed Mirage; despite its colorful and complex design, it remains elegant rather than gaudy. This ostentatious costume features a stunning color palate of various layered fabrics, as well as large and pointed shoulder plates. Beyond bold, this design is also intricate and a clear demonstration of attention to detail — as clearly on display with its belt, which contains a coin purse and a number of measuring instruments.\nAlmost undoubtedly the coolest outfit in Assassin's Creed Mirage, the Rostam Outfit is, in lore, the outfit of a legendary hero. This reference to Rostam, a legendary hero from Persian Mythology, is a brilliant instance of Ubisoft paying homage to the culture they built the game around. Unlocked after completing \"The Marked Coins\" contract, the Rostam Outfit is mostly modest yet beautiful, with a few particular highlights that make it so fantastic. Although mostly a gray tunic with a matching shawl scarf, the Rostam Outfit is elevated tenfold by the tiger pelt waist accent and the stunning brass left shoulder guard, which features the grotesque visage of a mythological beast.\nAlthough Assassin's Creed Mirage should be praised for its inclusion of excellently designed thematically appropriate outfits and costumes, undoubtedly the coolest apparel in the game is the homage to Ezio Auditore da Firenze's outfit from arguably the greatest Assassin's Creed game - Assassin's Creed 2. The Master Assassin Costume, though not a perfect reproduction of the iconic outfit, is exceptionally well-designed and a visual reminder of Assassin's Creed Mirage remaining in touch with its roots. Whilst there is a plethora of excellent outfit and costume customization options in Assassin's Creed Mirage, the Master Assassin Costume is undoubtedly the coolest.\nBased in the United Kingdom, Luke Horwitz is a graduate student in English Literature and Arts at the University of Oxford, having earned a BA in Music from the University of York."}
{"title": "Alabasta Eclipsed - One Piece's Wano Ending Overshadows the Series' Most Tearful Moment", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "One Piece's most emotional arc ending has been surpassed by the new Shogun of Wano's touching declaration, which was more earned than Vivi's.\nWarning: spoilers for One Piece episode #1078\nThe One Piece anime's ending of Wano managed to be even more emotional than Vivi's Alabasta sendoff. Wano saw Pirate Emperors Big Mom and Kaido vanquished. The land's citizens no longer needed to live under the brutal conditions they'd been subjugated to for decades. Luffy and his allies have previously saved kingdoms, but even the tearful goodbye to Alabasta's Princess doesn't compare to the emotions felt after Wano was reclaimed.\nThere have been more than a few heavily emotional arcs throughout One Piece's story. One of the most moving scenes that sticks in many fans' minds is Vivi's decision not to leave Alabasta after Crocodile's defeat. At that point, Vivi had been a prevalent member of the crew throughout several of the anime's early arcs. The drama of that decision, the Marine's pursuit, and the recently quelled Civil War helped make the end of the Alabasta arc incredibly moving for many viewers. However, author Eiichiro Oda has made that ending feel like it was on training wheels compared to the emotions that came after Kaido's defeat in the latest anime arc.\nRelated: One Piece's 25 Best Arcs, Ranked\nMany plot threads built up for years across several arcs finally paid off in episode #1078 of One Piece. Characters like Momonosuke and Kin'emon were introduced as far back as the Punk Hazard arc, which aired in 2013. Since then, Luffy and his crew made significant enemies of two of the world's most powerful pirates, Big Mom and Kaido. As the Straw Hat Crew closed in on Kaido's base of operations on Wano, the once beautiful home of the samurai seemed a lot different from how Luffy's companions remembered it. For over 20 years, Wano's lands had been stripped and poisoned while its citizens endured one of One Piece's most disturbing fates.\nOne of One Piece's least likable characters, Kurozumi Orochi, worked to transform Wano into a weapons factory for Kaido's Beast Pirates. Citizens were made into slaves, starvation was rampant, and Orochi found a way to make things even worse for the hungry people of Wano. Kaido's defective artificial Devil Fruits were fed to the starving citizens, which permanently harmed their brains, causing them only to be able to express joy. The cruel tactic stripped the people of all of their emotions even while their family members were murdered in front of them. Alabasta's citizens did not have to endure such atrocities for 20 years.\nWhile the anime has yet to have the Straw Hats leave Wano, episode #1078 beautifully concluded a horrific journey for the citizens of Wano with a triumphant and well-earned declaration. Momonosuke, the rightful Shogun of Wano who was thought long dead, appeared before his people to reveal that both Kaido and Orochi had been defeated. The touching speech ensured that after 20 years of suffering, the citizens would now be able to eat, drink, and live as they pleased, once again under a ruler who loves their country and its people.\nThe conclusion of the Alabasta arc is a fan-favorite for many good reasons. After becoming entangled with Vivi, Luffy and his crew were on a crash course with the notorious criminal syndicate Baroque Works and its cunning leader, the Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile. The villain manipulated the country's citizens with unnatural droughts and stroked tensions to cause a Civil War, all in his mission to find one of One Piece's ancient weapons that ended up being on Wano instead. Because Crocodile was such a compelling villain, finally watching Luffy take him down was rewarding in itself. Still, the arc's ending is highly regarded for more than its final battle.\nAfter saving Alabasta, the Marines granted the Straw Hats higher bounties, prompting the crew to flee the country before being captured. Thankfully, the Straw Hats were able to make it to their ship, which was being protected by the shape-shifting Baroque Works agent Bon Clay. He was willing to help because Luffy's crew had formed a strong friendship with him before finding out he worked for Crocodile. He felt the bond was so strong that he sacrificed his freedom to distract the Marines for the crew despite only being friends with them briefly. While that gesture was moving, it merely warmed up viewers' tear ducts for Vivi's moment.\nPrincess Vivi was given the choice to continue traveling with the Straw Hats, but it was a difficult decision between that and helping rebuild the country she worked so hard to save. She ultimately decided to stay behind, but her touching speech expressed her overwhelming gratitude and hope that, despite her decision, she was still regarded as a friend of the crew. Under the eye of the approaching Marines, the Straw Hats could not risk proving their connection to Alabasta's Princess. So they each brandished the Xs on their arms toward Vivi as the audience heard Luffy's words, \"No matter what happens, this thing on our left arm is the sign of our friendship!\"\nThere is little debate that Vivi was a more likable character than Momonosuke, which helped Alabasta's ending hit its emotional high. Still, Momo's journey to eventually become the Shogun of Wano was more traumatic for him and his people. After learning about the betrayals, Oden's life, and the story of Kin'emon and each of the Nine Red Scabbards, the desire to see Orochi dead and Wano free mounted to high levels that Alabasta did not.\nSince Wano was the longest arc, there was a lot of time devoted to showcasing the brutal hardships and cruelty its people endured, so when Momonosuke presented himself as the new Shogun that would usher the land into a new dawn, tears erupted from both his people and One Piece viewers. While both endings were fantastic and tear-jerking, Oda has improved his writing skills over One Piece's 24 years of publication to make Wano's plight as miserable as possible, so when its happy ending did come, it felt much more impactful. Time will tell if One Piece will be able to deliver an ending even more impactful than Wano's in its final saga.\nWatch the latest episodes of the One Piece anime on Crunchyroll and Funimation.\nSource: Crunchyroll Collection (1,2,3) /YouTube\nJason Hon is a Game Reviewer, Anime/Manga News Writer, and content creator behind the Mega Manga Mondays Podcast and the Comedic Gaming YouTube Channel Honzy and Friends!

{"title": "&quot;Wipe The Blood Off My Floor&quot;: Emily's Fair Play Closure Explained By Director", "date": "2023-10-09 12:59:27", "text": "Director Chloe Domont explains the closure that Phoebe Dynevor’s Emily achieves at the end of Fair Play, Netflix’s new erotic thriller.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for Fair Play.\nThis article contains discussion of sexual assault.\nFair Play director Chloe Domont explains Emily's final moments in the movie and how the character achieves closure. After premiering earlier this year at Sundance and earning strong reviews, Fair Play was finally released at the beginning of October on Netflix. The erotic thriller stars Bridgerton's Phoebe Dynevor as Emily and Solo: A Star Wars Story's Alden Ehrenreich as Luke, two analysts at the cutthroat hedge fund whose relationship begins to violently deteriorate when one of them receives a promotion.\nFollowing its release on Netflix last week, Domont now breaks down the Fair Play ending in a recent interview with Elle. The director explains the significance of Emily telling Luke to clean his blood off her floor and leave, detailing how the moment intersects with Luke's own arc after she cuts him with the kitchen knife and forces him into submission. Check out Domont's full comment below:\n“We’ve seen her go back to him before, and so I wanted to just tee up the audience to believe, ‘Oh my God, is she going to go back together with him again? Is this going to be a moment where they just both submit to a life of pain and dysfunction?’ \n“As you’re sitting with that, then she undercuts him with the [line], which is, ‘No, I’m actually done with this, and I’m done with you.’ It’s almost like she holds him for the last time, and once she does that for the last time, it’s a light switch. She’s now past it, and she’s out, and that’s it.\n“This is a man who refuses to accept this submissive role…but as soon as she forces him into submission, that’s when he’s able to release it all.”\nRelated: 15 Best Erotic Thrillers\nWhile Luke and Emily start Fair Play as a happy couple, things quickly go downhill after Dynevor's character is promoted to a leadership role that Luke thought he was going to get. Over the course of the film, Luke's jealously boils over, unearthing far more than just his competitive professional edge. Luke refuses to accept his own shortcomings as a person and genuinely believes that the only conceivable reason she would earn the promotion over him is if she was sleeping with their boss.\nAfter a screaming match in which Emily tells Luke the truth – that not only was he not considered for the promotion, but that their boss actually hired him as a favor to a friend and hopes that he quits – Luke truly goes off the rails. Still, he can't accept Emily's version of events. The anger and resentment building within him eventually culminates with a scene in which he violently sexual assaults Emily in a restaurant bathroom, a physical manifestation of the abuse and manipulation he's subjected her to throughout the film.\nFair Play's ending confrontation sees Emily reclaim a position of power, shutting down Luke's manipulation and exerting her own dominance after the sexual assault. Genuinely afraid for his life, Luke collapses to his knees and finally accepts his own failures, apologizing and pleading that he will do anything to make Emily feel okay after his actions. Only after Luke has reached a state of total submission has Emily achieved her goal, her justice, with Fair Play's final scenes hammering home just how these two characters will be totally changed moving forward.\nSource: Elle\n"}
{"title": "Why Seinfeld Season 1 Only Has 5 Episodes", "date": "2023-10-09 12:50:25", "text": "Seinfeld is a classic TV sitcom that ran for nine seasons through the '90s, but the show's first season only consists of five episodes.\nFor a show about nothing, Seinfeld has certainly made a substantial stamp on the public consciousness ― so it's a surprise that the classic '90s sitcom initially had so few episodes, with just five allocated to season 1. As well as boosting comedian and future Bee Movie star Jerry Seinfeld's career, the comedy broke the formulaic mold of TV comedies, providing characters that were less corny and focusing on their mundane and absurd conversations. While some parts of Seinfeld are hard to watch now, for the most part, its lack of moral lessons and character growth is refreshing, elevating the show to one of the best ever made.\nThe sitcom follows a fictional version of Jerry Seinfeld, along with his friends Elaine and George, and his neighbor Kramer. The plotlines of Seinfeld tie into the comedian's observational humor, showing the absurd incidents and meandering conversations that give him his material. Seinfeld's stand-up segments on the show provide a more original structure too, even if scornful references to \"airplane food\" jokes persist among the show's critics. Despite this originality, though ― as well as breaking out a strong cast, including comedic heavyweight Julia Louis-Dreyfus ― Seinfeld ​​​​​​season 1 is only five episodes long.\nRelated: Seinfeld Cast & Character Guide\nWhen Seinfeld was created in 1989, Jerry Seinfeld was a stand-up comedian, with a pivot to sitcoms being a risk. He and Larry David pitched the show to NBC as The Seinfeld Chronicles. The pilot did badly, though, with test audiences unimpressed by the supporting cast, and bemused by the undramatic plot ― in this case, about Jerry trying to read a woman's \"signals.\" Even getting five episodes was a struggle. Seinfeld wasn't picked up at all until TV boss Rick Ludwin canceled some of his projects to fund four more episodes. As reported by The Chicago Tribune, \"without Ludwin, there would have been no Seinfeld.\"\nThe show is now considered one of the all-time classics, spawning iconic pop culture moments such as Festivus and the Soup Nazi, but these elements came after the first and worst of Seinfeld's nine seasons. In addition to initially having a much clunkier name, Seinfeld's pilot episode was also missing Elaine. Seinfeld season 1 as a whole has a 76% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to the perfect 100% sustained from season 2 through season 5. The sitcom needed time to find its voice and try out different plot structures, and luckily that tiny inaugural run of five episodes gave it a good grounding to then begin doing so.\nNBC's reluctance to extend Seinfeld past one episode proved to be unfounded. The first season attracted solid ratings ― particularly episode 2, \"The Stake Out,\" which follows Jerry hanging out by a woman's office to get her name and number after missing the opportunity at a party. The Wrap reports that Seinfeld season 1 was the 17th most-watched show at the time, enough to secure it a renewal. Season 2 was longer, spanning a more conventional 12 episodes. This let the show really come into its own, as the second season was funnier and more well-formed, putting Seinfeld on the path to becoming the pop culture colossus it remains today.\nSources: The Chicago Tribune, The Wrap\n"}
{"title": "20 Hilarious Quotes From Dumb And Dumber That Are Still Funny Today", "date": "2023-10-09 12:40:28", "text": "Dumb and Dumber may not be the smartest comedy movie in the world, but it has some great lines that fans are still quoting today. \nThe best Dumb and Dumber quotes still have fans laughing nearly 30 years after it was first released. Dumb and Dumber hit the big screen and changed the comedy world forever with a hilarious and silly story of misadventures and a strangely endearing friendship. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) embarked on a quest with his best friend Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) in search of true love. Audiences loved director Peter Farrelly's celebration of two guys lacking in brain matter while embracing the spirit of adventure. It also gave rise to a ton of timeless Dumb and Dumber quotes that inspired an endless eternity of memes.\nThe movie saw Jim Carrey at the height of his popularity in the 1990s and added in a normally straight-guy actor in Jeff Daniels to ham it up throughout the running time. While the film had a prequel and a sequel, neither came close to the brilliance of the original, which launched the Farrelly brothers into comedy movie superstars. Even the brothers, who went on to make movies like There's Something About Mary and Me, Myself & Irene, couldn't reach the level of hilarious quotes that this debut movie delivered in its 106-minute running time.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nThe casting idea of Nicolas Cage as Harry in Dumb and Dumber is certainly interesting, there is no denying that Jeff Daniels is perfect for the role. Whereas Jim Carrey's Lloyd is a loud and manic dim-wit, Harry is more of a buffoonish manchild which can be almost charming at times. When first meeting Mary Swanson, the two start talking about dogs and Harry reveals the unusual breeding he did with a bulldog and a shih-tzu and that they called it a \"bull-s***.\" The way Harry laughs and takes such glee in his own stupid joke is what makes it such a funny moment.\nWhile Joe Mentalino (Mike Starr) hitches a ride with Harry and Lloyd, he knows he's in for a ride with a pair of dumb individuals. However, he may have underestimated just how dumb these two are. For example, at one point, in one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes of them all, Lloyd asks Joe, \"Hey, you wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?\" Now, thanks to Lloyd, you can still hear to this day the occasional \"EEEEEEEEEEE!\" screech. It was one of Jim Carrey's most annoying moments in movies.\nIt is interesting to consider that the adventures of Harry and Lloyd might make for a movie that could work as a television show. This becomes apparent within the first few minutes of Dumb and Dumber when Harry and Lloyd both lose their jobs and start searching for new ones, suggesting they bounce from job to job quite regularly. It is also not just that they are incompetent in their jobs, but also that they don't seem to have any motivation to work. After returning from a day of job hunting Harry complains that there are absolutely no jobs available anywhere with Lloyd scoffing at the idea that 40 hours a week is not a reasonable request. Watching a show based on their frequent job searches would be a lot of fun.\nHarry makes this wacky comment about a physical map while the duo drives. What's surprising about Harry's ridiculous comment isn't the fact he has no clue the map's measurements are scaled down, it's more that he has any semblance of an idea about how to use a map. While people born after 2000 have likely never used a real map, this remains one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes because Harry takes it that one step further in his ignorance. Even people using GPS know that the distance shown is not real.\nWhen thinking of heartthrobs from the '90s, people think of Brad Pitt, John Stamos, or George Clooney. However, there is one who thinks he stands above the rest - Lloyd Christmas. The man believed he knew how to let the ladies know he was single and ready to mingle. He also knew that he couldn't come across as desperate when wanting to pick up a woman. This led to him telling his buddy Harry one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, saying, \"I’m going to hang by the bar. Put out the vibe.\" The funny line is made better by Jim Carrey's performance.\nWhen Lloyd was working as a driver, he decided to throw out his own icebreaker to a client. However, not even Lloyd realizes how dumb he sounded delivering one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes in the movie. In the movie itself, the scene just gets dumber and dumber when Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) asks Lloyd how he figured it out. This is when Lloyd showed he wasn't as dumb as most people might believe. \"Well, I saw your luggage. Then when I noticed the airline ticket I put two and two together.\"\nThe early sequence of Lloyd dropping Mary off at the airport is one of the many Dumb and Dumber scenes that still make audiences laugh. It culminates with the hilarious image of Lloyd heroically running down the jet way to deliver Mary's briefcase only for the plane to already be gone and Lloyd to fall out onto the runway. As funny as it is, it may not be an unusual occurrence for Lloyd. When Harry asks how his day was, Lloyd responds, \"Not bad. Fell off the jet way again.\" The idea this happens so often that it is barely noteworthy makes the whole idea that much funnier.\nLloyd is clearly not the brightest, evidenced by this mixup of similar sounding countries. When it comes to Lloyd and his best Dumb and Dumber quotes, he not only got them confused but looked like a complete idiot to everyone when he did so. When Lloyd found someone who was from Austria, he decided to try to mimic their dialect. However, he yelled out \"g'day, mate. Let's put another shrimp on the barbie,\" which is a way to mock an Australian dialect. Of course, only person mocked here was Lloyd.\nWhile Lloyd is the kind of person who thinks he can \"vibe\" by the bar and the women will come to him (they don't), Harry is a lot less secure in his willingness to approach women. When he does at that same party, he delivers one of the best Dumb and Dumber lines but does it in a completely innocent manner. When Mary (Lauren Holly) is standing alone, Harry walks up and says \"nice set of hooters you got there.\" While she was taken aback, he was actually talking about a pair of owls she was looking at in a cage.\nThe first half of Dumb and Dumber is one of the great road trip comedies that allows for endless hijinks with Harry and Lloyd on the open road. As with most road trip comedies, there is a scene with the duo being pulled over by the police. While the actual scene with the cop offers one of the many gross-out gags in the movie, the biggest laugh comes from Harry's response to the cop telling him to pull over. It is hard not to laugh at the idea of Harry assuming the cop has his lights and siren on and pulls up to their window just to ask Harry about his fashion choices.\nTo the people of Boston, Cam Neely will always be a hockey legend, finishing with such a historic hockey career. For everyone else outside Massachusetts and the hockey world, he's simply known as Sea Bass. It's a cameo a select group can fully appreciate, but anyone who's seen Dumb and Dumber knows Sea Bass for spitting in Harry's burger after getting hit in the head with a salt shaker. As Sea Bass approaches Harry and Lloyd's table, one of his friends yelled out one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes. And it still holds up today in pretty much any setting.\nRELATED: Every Jim Carrey Movie Ranked Worst To Best\nThe best Dumb and Dumber quotes are quick. A few seconds at most. This one lasts about 12 seconds, yet still remains one of the greats from Dumb and Dumber. Jeff Daniels has been in some impressive roles through the years, branching well outside of comedy. However, this could be his greatest moment as an actor, ever. For the first time, it actually feels like Harry is about to lose it on Lloyd. Nine seconds into what feels like a father scolding his son, audiences were reminded exactly how dumb Harry is. \"Just when I think you couldn’t possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this… and totally redeem yourself!\"\nLloyd started off this with a question for Mary. He asked, \"What do you think the chances are of a guy like you and a girl like me... ending up together?\" Harry and Lloyd had come a long way to find Mary and let her know how he feels. When she said the chances are \"not good,\" he asks, if that means one in a hundred chance. She said it was more like one in a million, and this made Lloyd happy. He smiled and said, \"so you're tellin' me there's a chance\" before letting out a cheer. The line is so funny that it has gone on to become a popular meme.\nHarry and Lloyd routinely got the wrong end of the stick, especially when it came to cultural references. When deciding on a plan for meeting Mary Swanson, Lloyd relies on an overabundance of confidence, even if it leaves him looking dumber than ever before. A strumpet is a female prostitute, which is a far cry from his intended cultural reference regarding the inviting of guests in for tea and crumpets, where the original saying came from. Much like the Austrian confusion, it proves that Lloyd is always sure he has a great one-liner, even when he has no clue what he is talking about.\nAlready down on their luck and out of work, Harry and Lloyd reached their breaking point when two thugs spied them in a case of mistaken identity. Before exiting their home, the thugs left a little parting gift in the favor of a dead bird whose head they twisted off. The two hapless friends returned home to find the dead bird in the cage, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. After Jim Carrey's Lloyd delivered one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, it was the final excuse they needed to do a cross-country tour to Aspen in search of greener pastures, and in search of Lloyd's love of his life.\nPlenty of younger viewers might not understand the meaning of this quip, and this was even the case back in 1994. Lloyd trolls the diner waitress with this question, calling her Flo, causing Harry to fly into a fit of hysterical laughter. The quote references the 1976 sitcom Alice, starring Linda Lavin as a diner waitress named Alice Hyatt. She had a feisty red-haired co-worker at the diner played by Polly Holliday named Florence Jean \"Flo\" Castleberry. With them constantly calling her over as \"Flo,\" it was a joke that almost no one understood outside the pair.\nWhen Lloyd catches Harry going on dates with Mary Swanson after promising to set the two up on a date, his world shatters. Rather than confront Harry about his two-timing, Lloyd decides to wait it out and see how his former best friend will react. After asking Lloyd why Mary would want to meet him at a bar at 9 a.m. instead of 9 p.m., Lloyd offers up a pitch-perfect response that betrays his own shallowness and empty-headed views on life. In one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, he just assumed something incorrect about her.\nDrowning his sorrows at the bar after thinking Mary Swanson stood him up, Lloyd waits to no avail. Finally, the bartender gives him the address where Mary is staying so that he can go meet her there. Excited beyond belief, Lloyd prepares to rush out of the bar before spotting a framed picture of the Apollo moon landing. Evidently, not one to keep up with current events, Lloyd yells out America's greatest triumph to a confused crowd. In one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, Lloyd proved that he knows almost nothing outside his own personal bubble.\nThe later Dumb and Dumber movies never reached the heights of the original making the sequel and prequel feel unnecessary. It is especially true when looking back on the ending of the first movie and seeing how perfectly it left these two characters. After failing to find their fortune and love with Mary Swanson, Harry and Lloyd are hitchhiking along the highway when a fan full of bikini models stops and says they are looking for assistants to help lotion them up. Harry points them to the next town to look for available men.\nAs the bus pulls away, Lloyd finally realizes Harry's mistake and waves them down again, giving them more accurate directions. The fact that the friends were presented with their happy ending but were too dim to recognize it is a perfect place to leave these two -- blissfully ignorant together.\nCarefully budgeting for their cross-country adventure to Aspen, Harry and Lloyd stop off to pick up a few items for the trip. Harry notices Lloyd eating some snacks which he believes were not part of the budget. When Lloyd mentions that he raised $25 bucks by selling a few things to a blind kid named Billy, Harry becomes suspicious. Eventually, Lloyd spills the beans, admitting that he sold Harry's dead bird Petey to Billy before fleeing the city. When Harry reminds Lloyd that Petey no longer has a head, the former assures him that he took care of it in a horrifying Dumb and Dumber moment.\n\nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

The latest sequel in the Saw franchise takes place between the first and second films, wherein John Kramer traps a group of scammers offering up a miracle cure for cancer. The movie makes references to plenty of other films in the franchise, especially with the return of Shawnee Smith as Amanda.\nNow, Josh Stolberg has revealed a cut scene from Saw X that would have taken viewers back to a scene from Saw VI.\nThe scene would have featured John torturing someone with a tank full of piranhas, who would be revealed as an insurance salesman working for William Easton. This scene would have added another reference to the latest film, tying every entry in the franchise together more tightly.\nSaw VI and Saw X are connected thematically, as both entries involve John seeking revenge against those who took advantage of his cancer diagnosis. However, both stories are also tied to each other's events. In Saw VI, it's revealed William did not help John in his attempts to pay for an experimental cancer treatment in Norway. That treatment ended up being the scam featured in the latest film, revealing how both stories are connected to one another.\nIf the Saw VI flashback had happened, it would have more directly showcased how the newest movie was using established plot points to fit it into the timeline. Since Saw X may not be the final movie, a future installment could more directly showcase how both movies are connected. This would fill in the gap within the franchise's timeline more concretely.\nHowever, the Saw X mid-credits scene - which references another aspect of the series - indicates a future installment could jump forward in the timeline. If that's the case, then the reference to Saw VI could end up being kept as an Easter egg for attentive viewers. Even so, Stolberg's revelation helps tie elements of the franchise together that otherwise would have remained mysterious.\nSource: Josh Stolberg/Twitter\n"}

By having talented people with specific roles, such as Mutanga handling Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's LEGO sequence, the Spider-Verse franchise managed to keep its sprawling multiverse story unique and diverse, aiding Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's cast to deliver the best performances possible.\nHowever, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse's delay — with the movie getting removed from Sony Pictures' release schedule — reveals a problem to the franchise. Recently, a Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse report claimed the production had bad working conditions. According to the report, over 100 people working on the second movie in the Spider-Verse franchise left the film due to poor working conditions, such as constant revisions — above the usual level — and animators having to work 11 hours a day every week for more than a year.\nThe Spider-Verse franchise has become so popular due to its rich characters and thrilling story, but most of all due to the artistry displayed in each frame of both Spider-Verse movies so far. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse managed to improve on the original animated film's innovative visual style, taking things to the next level. That was only possible due to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's crew being extremely talented and having a clear love for the Spider-Man mythos. Hopefully, the trilogy's final movie being delayed allows the film's crew to have healthy working conditions, resulting in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse being even better than Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\nSource: Preston Mutanga/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "Every Jujutsu Kaisen Arc Ranked From Worst to Best", "date": "2023-10-09 12:31:26", "text": "After being serialized for over 5 years Jujutsu Kaisen has a variety of arcs, all of which are great but some of which are better than others.\nWarning! Contains major spoilers for the Jujutsu Kaisen manga!\nJujutsu Kaisen is currently one of Shonen Jump's most iconic battle manga, standing alongside the likes of My Hero Academia and One Piece. This is partially due to how long it has been serialized, spanning multiple intense arcs. Now that the manga is officially in its end game, it seems a perfect time to compare these storylines and see which Jujutsu Kaisen arcs are the best.\nOf course, as fans know, no Jujutsu Kaisen arc is abjectly terrible. They all feed into the manga's overall narrative in interesting ways and often are filled with innovative fight scenes. Mangaka Gege Akutami is a master at constructing the plot of the series simultaneously on a micro and macro level, which leads these arcs to all be incredibly satisfying even if they may not measure up to the best moments the series has to offer. However, some storylines stand out as being a cut above the rest with the best of them being one of the best Shonen manga arcs ever. These are all of Jujutsu Kaisen's arcs ranked from worst to best.\nAs the first storyline after the Shibuya Incident, the Itadori's Extermination arc had some big shoes to fill but largely can't maintain the same standard of quality as its predecessor. This isn't to say it's all bad. The aftermath of the Shibuya Incident is fascinating and tragic to witness and the reintroduction of Yuta is superb. But the lack of any major fights in this arc really holds it back.\nWhile the Death Painting arc has two great fights, that's pretty much all it has going for it. The arc does introduce the concept of Cursed Wombs, which would become important later on when Choso became more of a character, so it's far from filler. However, the brevity of the arc also works against it, making it one of the more forgettable storylines in the series. But forgettable isn't bad, with moments like Itadori and Nobara's dual black flash really standing out. It just doesn't compare to the later storylines the story would tackle.\nThis may be a controversial pick but the Fearsome Womb arc deserves it. Being the first arc of the main series the Fearsome Womb arc has a lot of exposition to do, and luckily it does it well, setting up the world of sorcery and curses quite nicely while also introducing the main characters of the series. It also fears the first fight between Gojo and Sukuna as well as Yuji's shocking \"death\". However, like the Death Painting arc it is too short to make a lasting impact on the audience beyond hooking them on the story. Still as an opener goes, few series could do better.\nThe Culling Game has been one of the most controversial arcs in Jujutsu Kaisen history. It features some of the highest highs the series has to offer like Sukuna possessing Megumi and the fight between Hakari and Kashimo, but it also drags. Focusing on each colony individually meant that certain characters weren't featured for a very long time and made many of the new characters and fights feel inconsequential. However, the arc may read better on a reread after the series is over as the Culling Game may have set up ideas that haven't actually paid off yet.\nThis arc is kind of a weird one given it isn't really part of the main series, instead serving as a prequel focused on Yuta Okkotsu. Its events are very important for the series as a whole featuring the culmination of Geto's plans and his death at the hands of Gojo. It also shows a variety of characters before their introduction in the main series like Gojo, Maki, Panda, and Inumaki. Its greatest strength however is telling one relatively self-contained story about Yuta's growth as a character, which makes it more fulfilling than some of the other arcs on this list.\nThe Gojo's Past arc is another arc taking place before the events of the main series, except this time the chapters were released as part of Jujutsu Kaisen's regular serialization. It follows Gojo and Geto's high school years as they take on a mission to protect a young girl before she gets assimilated by the immortal sorcerer Tengen. Unfortunately their mission fails due to the actions of one of Jujutsu Kaisen's coolest villains Toji Fushiguro, causing the arc to be incredibly tragic. Just like in the Cursed Child arc, this storyline is satisfying on its own due to it being relatively disconnected from the main plot, which elevates it above many arcs on this list.\nThis arc should probably rank lower on this list for a variety of reasons. Yuji and Megumi's quest to recruit Hakari for the Culling Game is relatively boring, and the arc is pretty short overall. However, this arc also features Maki's awakening and the incredibly cathartic slaughter of the Zenin clan, which is one of the best parts of the entire series. Sure that sequence is a bit rough around the edges as Gege didn't have time to polish it up before release. But the sheer emotional weight and epic scale of the destruction make up for that and make Perfect Preparation a top-tier Jujutsu Kaisen arc.\nThis arc is one of the most tragic and twisted arcs of the series, which perfectly set the tone for the later arcs to come. The arc does a great job at establishing Mahito as a twisted villain with a personal connection to Yuji. Also Yuji's friendship with Junpei is touching and his horror upon their death at the hands of Mahito leads to one of the coolest panels in the entire series. Adding Nanami's introduction along with the multiple fights against Mahito that hinted at how cool Jujutsu Kaisen battles can be makes this easily one of the best arcs in the series despite how early into the manga it comes.\nThis arc features an incredible expansion of Jujutsu Kaisen's cast of characters by introducing the sorcerers at the Kyoto school. This includes some fan favorites such as Miwa and the hilariously lovable Todo. Not only this but it features some epic fights both between the sorcerers themselves and against the Disaster Curse Hanami who infiltrates the event. In addition to the high-octane fights it also takes the time to show off fun interactions between the high school students such as in the baseball game that takes place after Hanami is defeated. This arc truly has everything that makes Jujutsu Kaisen special which makes it a top 3 arc.\nPutting this arc so high up on this list may be premature given it is still ongoing. However, the Gojo vs Sukuna fight alone was one of the best things Jujutsu Kaisen has ever done and every chapter after that has just carried forward the story's momentum. Many fans were understandably upset at Gojo's shocking death, but even they can't deny that it served to make Sukuna one of the most threatening Shonen villains of all time. Seeing the rest of the cast scramble to try and defeat him after Gojo's death just hammers that point home further and makes this unpredictable arc feel simultaneously hopeless and exciting. As the culmination of the entire series this deserves a place at the top of the list.\nWhile the current Shinjuku Showdown arc could eventually dethrone it, the Shibuya Incident currently stands as the best arc in Jujutsu Kaisen. The arc forever changed Jujutsu Kaisen's status quo and its revolutionary nature changed Shonen manga forever. It also featured some of the best and most chaotic fights in the series with each battle bleeding over into the other ones and creating a beautiful whole. As the culmination of everything that came before it, the Shibuya Incident is in equal measure tragic and cathartic, creating one of the best Shonen arcs of all time.\nAs Jujutsu Kaisen races towards its conclusion, this ranking may change depending on how the final arcs of the series turn out. But no matter how the series concludes, the greatness of these arcs leave a lasting legacy that is sure to influence the next generation of Shonen manga. Even Jujutsu Kaisen's worst arcs have great moments and its best arcs show why it is one of the best modern Shonen series out there.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

{"title": "Why Rings Of Power's LOTR Canon Problems Will Be Much Worse In Season 2", "date": "2023-10-09 12:31:26", "text": "The canonical problems with The Rings of Power will be more difficult to solve in Season 2. Here's why Amazon's fantasy series is in danger.\nThe Rings of Power has been suffering from some canonical problems pertaining to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and they're likely to be much worse in season 2. The first season of Amazon's high fantasy series, based on the novels set in Tolkien's beloved Middle-earth, was already divisive among serious fans. Not only did it take liberties with the Lord of the Rings timeline by condensing it, but it also positioned certain celebrated characters, which are separated by hundreds of years in Tolkien's works, actively in the same events.\nWith its high budget, strong performances, and attention to detail, Rings of Power is Amazon's best fantasy series so far, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its momentum going into season 2. Issues surrounding the legal rights to Tolkien's work that would provide context for some of the most important events in Middle-earth, as well as certain creative differences, present unique challenges. At a time when fans have their pick of series with The Wheel of Time and House of the Dragon, The Rings of Power season 2 will need to be its strongest so far.\nThe Rings of Power's first season largely took place in the Second Age which, although outlined in The Silmarillion, acted more like appendices. Amazon did not procure the rights for the bulk of the material, which granted the streaming giant a lot more creative leeway but at the same time angered certain die-hard devotees of Tolkien's works. The overarching story for The Rings of Power's second season is naturally going to be more restricted the closer it gets to important events such as the forging of the One Ring, Sauron's war with the Elves, and the Fall of Numenor.\nA lot of source material exists for these monumental moments in The Lord of the Rings canon and timeline which is helpful to make the series authentic, but presents its own issues. For one thing, there is an increased potential for contradictions and plot holes that will alienate and anger Tolkien purists. For another, any drastic changes to certain key events could create issues when linking up to either Tolkien's books or Peter Jackson's beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy of movies.\nSince The Rings of Power timeline has had to be so condensed, with events that should have taken place hundreds of years apart occurring at the same time, there's been a vocal outcry from the fans. If The Rings of Power season 2 stays canonical, this should alleviate some of the division among the fandom, but it's a promise that will be hard to keep. Given how many deviations and drastic changes to original details in season 1, it's going to be particularly tricky to stay true to canon while at the same time filming a season that appears to flow organically from its predecessor.\nThe Rings of Power new Mordor origins and the foundation of Mount Doom create figurative and literal fissures in the foundation of the series. Having Celebrimbor and Isildur alive at the same time doesn't just condense the timeline, it risks making Tolkien's world-building seem small and rushed. The sprawl to Middle-earth, as well as its complexity, are two of its most daunting and revered qualities, and they will hopefully be maintained as The Rings of Power goes forward, particularly in regards to the Dwarven kingdoms, which have been a series highlight so far.\nNot being able to draw from The Silmarillion has proven to be one of the most frustrating aspects of The Rings of Power. Amazon may only use what's in The Lord of the Rings and its appendices, which has made telling a canonically correct Second Age story difficult without contradicting Tolkien's established lore. Tolkien's Estate never put the rights to The Silmarillion up for sale because as far back as the late '60s, when Tolkien sold the rights to The Lord of the Rings originally to the Saul Zaentz Company, they had \"matching rights\" to it, and possibly The Unfinished Tales\nAmazon didn't approach the Estate to purchase the rights, rather, the Estate explored options for a potential buyer for The Lord of the Rings TV rights. To circumvent the \"matching rights\" issue created by Tolkien's sale of The Lord of the Rings film rights to the Saul Zaentz Company, they granted the potential buyer access to more content through direct consultation. As a result, the Estate had the ability to have much more influence over shaping Tolkien's continued stories in Middle-earth with The Rings of Power than either The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit trilogies.\n"}

The Prophets are one of the Star Trek franchise’s most enigmatic species; a non-linear, non-corporeal race residing in the Bajoran Wormhole. They are powerful beyond belief, but in Star Trek #12, readers learn that one member of the Theseus’ crew possesses an intellect far beyond the Prophets.\nIn Star Trek #12 – written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Angelu Unzueta – as Captain Sisko fights Kahless on the Klingon homeworld, he has a vision of the crews of the Theseus and Defiant, working to harness the power of the Bajoran Orb of Creation.\nHis narration offers deep insight into each character – including T'Lir, the Theseus’ science officer, who Sisko calls a “genius with a mind beyond even the Prophets’ comprehension.”\nRelated: These Two Characters Are Star Trek's Newest, Greatest Odd Couple\nProving Sisko’s point, T’Lir is instrumental in unleashing the Orb of Creation’s vast power to defeat Kahless in Star Trek #12, the climax Star Trek's crossover event, \"Day of Blood.\" T’Lir is one of the most exciting additions to the Star Trek universe. Created for IDW’s flagship Star Trek title, T’LIr is the first non-binary Vulcan featured in the franchise. Readers have seen tantalizing glimpses of T’Lir, and there is clearly more to them than meets the eye. They refer to themselves as “T’Lir, a Vulcan of Starfleet” and they seemingly have superpowers. The mystery of T’Lir has played out across Star Trek’s first year, adding another layer of intrigue to the story.\nWhile Trek fans wait to learn exactly who T’Lir is, Sisko drops a surprising revelation about them in Star Trek #12. To be smarter than one of the Bajoran Prophets is a huge deal. The Prophets exist outside of space and time, in a realm called “the Celestial Temple,” another name for the Bajoran wormhole. The Prophets created the immensely powerful Orbs, each representing a facet of existence. T’Lir helps crack the Orb of Creation, using their great intellect to learn the Prophets secrets, in order to stop Kahless. They successfully harness the Orb’s powers, showing their incredible intelligence, and playing a pivotal role in the conclusion to \"Day of Blood.\"\nT’Lir has shown themselves to be perhaps the smartest member of the Theseus’ crew, rivaling even Data. T’Lir has shown they grasp concepts and theories on the cutting edge of 24th-century science–and beyond. This no doubt owes to their mysterious, possibly cosmic nature, and leaves fans wondering if T’Lir, in their true form, would be a match for the Prophets or other god-like beings like Q. There is so much more to T’Lir to be discovered and as Star Trek enters its second year, more will certainly be revealed. T’Lir has already proven themselves the smartest person in the Star Trek franchise, even more than Sisko.\nStar Trek #12 is on sale now from IDW Publishing!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "Adele Warned Jennifer Lawrence Not To Do Sci-Fi Movie With Chris Pratt", "date": "2023-10-09 12:20:27", "text": "Jennifer Lawrence recalls English singer/songwriter Adele warning her against taking the doomed role in the 2016 sci-fi movie Passengers.\nThe Jennifer Lawrence Passengers movie might not have played out like it did if she had listened to English singer/songwriter Adele's warning not to appear in the critically denounced sci-fi romance. Lawrence was already a bona fide star, with her role as Katniss Everdeen in the adaptation of The Hunger Games and in the X-Men movies. Even before this successful leap into the mainstream, at just 20 years old Lawrence was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her performance in the chilling thriller Winter's Bone. \nWith Hunger Games garnering both critical and commercial success, Lawrence was set to break out into further Hollywood in what was touted to be an excellent career. With an overall shift from movie stars being the draw for audiences to popular proven properties, she became one of the few Hollywood stars that fans would flock to see. Of course, it is rare for any actor to be able to entirely avoid criticism or commercial failure at some point in their career, and Lawrence did find herself on the receiving end of less favorable reviews for the widely forgotten spy thriller Red Sparrow and even a Razzie nomination for her role in Darren Aronofsky's polarizing Mother!\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nOne of Lawrence's regrettable on-screen performances was alongside Chris Pratt in Morten Tyldum's Passengers. In an interview, Lawrence said she could feel her fans' distress at some of the films she had taken part in. When asked what films made her feel that way, she responded with Passengers and shared the advice Adele gave her before accepting the role (via The New York Times).\n\"Passengers,’ I guess. Adele told me not to do it! She was like, ‘I feel like space movies are the new vampire movies.’ I should have listened to her.”\nWhile Jennifer Lawrence was becoming a massive movie star, Adele was becoming one of the bestselling musical artists on the planet. With only a two-year age difference between them, they became fast friends and were there for each other when they needed advice. They were also there for each other when it came to having a good time. This was evident by a night out on the town that Lawrence mentioned in her interview with the NYT. The two decided to go out to a club called Pieces, without a VIP section or bodyguards. What resulted was a night documented online by people who whipped out their phones to film the two ladies partying with the masses.\nRELATED: Every Jennifer Lawrence Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n Passengers remains a title that sticks out sorely from the actresses' relatively well-regarded resume. The film itself was widely criticized for raising an ethical dilemma taken by Pratt's character but exploring it too broadly for the film to maintain any real substance. Pratt's Jim wakes Lawrence's Aurora from a hibernation pod so that he does not have to live out his remaining years on a doomed off-course spacecraft alone, hiding his receipt that he opened the pod. Shaping this problem of truth and solitude, or deceit and companionship, into a hollow romance, in which Aurora is never given particularly deep characterization or soul.\nIt also closed Passengers' story with a contrived happy ending, in which the protagonists save everyone on the ship and share a future together, leaving the film with a sour critical reception. Insufficient thematic exploration and watered-down CGI spectacle aside, what likely infuriated Lawrence fans about Passengers the most was how little the actress was given to do. Even though criticisms of her being slightly wooden in the role are at least somewhat justified, it is hard to deny that Aurora's characterization gave Lawrence little to fashion into a memorable performance.\nLawrence's career trajectory suggests how quick Hollywood is to lose interest in some of its stars. Immediately after Passengers flopped, Lawrence made mother!, which was an experimental Darren Aronofsky movie that left many viewers cold, and then Red Sparrow, a spy thriller that received mixed reviews at best. Dark Phoenix not only ended up as a low point for Fox's X-Men movies, but it killed off Lawrence's Mystique, ending her run with the franchise at that point. The good news is that things have been looking up for the actor lately.\nLawrence's career has hardly stagnated in recent years, her role in Adam Mckay's Don't Look Up showing she still fits in just fine around other A-List names like Leonardo DiCaprio. She also had a critically acclaimed performance in Causeway and took on a broad comedy role in No Hard Feelings in 2023. It's important to remember that even with a few flops, Lawrence is an Oscar-winning actress and likely still has plenty in the tank for upcoming roles. Though, whether she'll ever fancy another forage into sci-fi is perhaps a more skeptical matter.\n\n"}
{"title": "10 Ways The MCU Has Already Set Up The Perfect Thor 5 Story", "date": "2023-10-09 12:20:26", "text": "Thor 5 is rumored to be in development at Marvel Studios, and several brilliant storylines have already been set up for Thor's next MCU adventure.\nMarvel Studios has already set up several perfect storylines for the rumored Thor 5 in the MCU. Despite the disappointing reception to 2022's Thor: Love and Thunder, Chris Hemsworth was confirmed to be returning to the MCU as Thor, the Asgardian God of Thunder. Hemsworth has portrayed Thor since 2011's eponymous Phase 1 project, and went on to become a founding member of the Avengers and one of the MCU's most important heroes. He is currently the only superhero to receive four solo feature films in the MCU, and recent rumors suggest that Marvel Studios may be putting Thor 5 into development, potentially redeeming Thor after a troubling Phase 4.\nAlthough Thor 5 hasn't yet been confirmed by Marvel Studios, the potential sequel has become a hot topic of discussion, particularly after recent comments from director Taika Waititi. Waititi suggested that the Thor 5 villain could be even stronger than Thor: Ragnarok's Hela, but the consensus among fans - and Chris Hemsworth himself - is that Thor 5 will need to change the tone of the MCU's Thor franchise, avoiding the comedic mistakes of Love and Thunder. This suggests that Thor could embark on a darker adventure in Thor 5, and though the details of this are currently speculation, Marvel Studios has already set up several potential storylines for Thor's next sequel.\nThor: Love and Thunder introduced a new hero to the MCU who could have the power to replace the God of Thunder. Gorr the God Butcher's daughter, Love, was resurrected by Eternity in Love and Thunder, and seemingly returned imbued with Eternity's own abilities. Portrayed by India Hemsworth, Love was adopted by Thor in Love and Thunder, implying that, when he returns, she will follow suit. Thor 5 could give Love a chance to show off her ambiguous powers, and could set her up as a new cosmic superhero in the MCU, potentially allowing her to fill her adoptive father's shoes should Thor 5 be Chris Hemsworth's final project.\nFollowing its release, Phase 5's Secret Invasion became one of the MCU's lowest-rated projects, but the Disney+ series did set the stage for some major storylines to unfold in the MCU's future. As well as establishing a massive Skrull presence on Earth, Secret Invasion ended with Dermot Mulroney's President Ritson declaring war on extraterrestrial species living on Earth, which could encompass the alien residents of New Asgard. Ritson is set to be replaced by Harrison Ford's President Ross in Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts, but this crusade on Earth's alien inhabitants could continue into Thor 5 and beyond.\nBoth Thor and Tom Hiddleston's Loki have seen major character developments during their MCU careers, with the latter seeing the most transformation in his Multiverse Saga series, Loki. While the events of Loki are set separate from the MCU's main continuity, it's very likely that Marvel Studios is gearing up the God of Mischief to return to the MCU proper and reunite with his brother. The version of Loki returning to the MCU's main timeline will be unrecognizable to Thor, but it would still be great to see Thor and Loki reuniting to embark on an adventure together, and Thor 5 is the perfect place for this to occur.\nOver the course of his MCU journey, Thor has jumped from team to team: he joined the Avengers, traveled with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and formed the Revengers in Thor: Ragnarok. Thor: Love and Thunder saw him try to form a new team of gods in the MCU after making his way to Omnipotence City. This could have teased the debut of the God Squad, a Marvel Comics team comprised of powerful god-like characters. With the introduction of Natalie Portman's Mighty Thor, Brett Goldstein's Hercules, and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie needing serious development, Thor 5 could finally bring together the God Squad.\nMonster-turned-hero Beta Ray Bill has been rumored to be coming to the MCU for several years, with this speculation only rising after a statue of his head was glimpsed on the Grandmaster's tower in Thor: Ragnarok. In Marvel Comics, Beta Ray Bill is the first character outside the Norse pantheon capable of wielding Mjolnir, Thor's enchanted hammer, so he could be introduced to the MCU as a replacement for the God of Thunder. He usually wields Stormbreaker in the comics, which has been Thor's weapon of choice since Avengers: Infinity War, so the foundations are already in place for Thor 5 to finally debut Beta Ray Bill in the MCU.\nMarvel Comics' Thor: Disassembled was a pivotal storyline for the God of Thunder, featuring Thor battling a variety of villains in an effort to prevent Ragnarok from destroying Asgard. While pieces of this storyline have already been adapted for the MCU, Marvel Studios can alter it slightly to feature returning Thor villains, without retconning their fates from previous MCU projects. Thor's MCU villains have often come under scrutiny for not being developed, so this could be the perfect opportunity to give Malekith, Hela, and Gorr the God Butcher more screen-time. Avengers: Disassembled also ends with Thor's death, so this could be a beautiful swansong for Chris Hemsworth's hero.\nIn recent years, Marvel Studios has been exploring the concept of the afterlife in much more detail, introducing the Ancestral Plane in Black Panther, the Duat and the Field of Reeds in Moon Knight, and Rocket's afterlife in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Thor: Love and Thunder also provided the first real look at the Norse afterlife of Valhalla, as Jane Foster finds herself there after dying in battle as the Mighty Thor. Reuniting with Idris Elba's Heimdall, Foster's appearance in Valhalla teased a major storyline in Marvel Comics in which she returns from Valhalla as a Valkyrie, so this could be explored in Thor 5.\n2027's Avengers: Secret Wars is expected to be adapted from Marvel Comics' destructive crossover storyline, 2015's Secret Wars. This event saw the multiverse destroyed by an incursion, with fragments of several surviving realities being brought together in Battleworld. Battleworld's police force was the Thor Corps, a group of Thor variants from a multitude of universes. If Chris Hemsworth is set to leave the MCU after the Multiverse Saga, debuting the Thor Corps would create a powerful exit for Thor, and introducing them in Thor 5 could begin to set the stage for Secret Wars. This could also be used to debut a new version of Thor for the MCU's future.\nPerhaps the most obvious storyline for Thor 5 would see the return of Brett Goldstein's Hercules, who was introduced in Thor: Love and Thunder's mid-credits scene. This scene saw Russell Crowe's Zeus send his son, Hercules, on a mission to eliminate Thor and strike fear into their followers once again. Hercules is an incredibly powerful hero in Marvel Comics, but was originally depicted as an antagonist to Thor, so this would perfectly fulfill Waititi's wishes to have a villain more powerful than Hela in Thor 5. Hercules' current absence in the MCU is jarring, so this formidable character needs to return soon, and become a more permanent fixture in the MCU.\nThor: Love and Thunder wasn't the only Phase 4 project to receive criticism. Chloé Zhao's Eternals is also regarded as one of the more disappointing projects of Phase 4, and this mixed reception has left sequels to both projects in jeopardy. One way to solve this problem could be to combine Thor 5 and Eternals 2 into one epic crossover project, potentially adapting Marvel Comics' Celestial Saga, which saw Thor battle the Eternals and the Celestials. This could be a great way to continue all these characters' stories, without putting too much pressure on them to carry an entire MCU project alone.\n"}
{"title": "Lena Headey's New Sci-Fi Role Is The Perfect Follow-Up To Cersei Lannister", "date": "2023-10-09 12:20:26", "text": "Lena Heady is best known for her role as Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones, but now, her newest role will give her a fresh but familiar look. \nAlthough Lena Heady is best known for her portrayal of Game of Thrones' villainous Cersei Lannister, her newest television role in Beacon 23 is the perfect follow up, that will both put Heady back in the spotlight and allow her strengths to shine through. For eight seasons, Heady portrayed the sometimes villain, sometimes hero Cersei Lannister. Though Heady was already well-established as an actor before Game of Thrones, her role as Cersei remains iconic, despite the series ending in 2019. Arguably, it is now what she is best known for.\nLuckily, Lena Heady has the chance to redefine herself as she returns to the screen in Beacon 23. The science fiction show is based on a short story series of the same name, written by Hugh Howey, and is set to be released in November 2023. It follows Heady's character Aster and Stephan James' Halan as they become trapped at the end of the known universe. Though their lives become entangled, trust cannot be easily given, leading to a tense story filled with mystery and danger. Considering Heady's experience with playing morally gray characters, it should be no surprise that her character Aster is the most suspicious character of all.\nRelated: Game of Thrones: The Real-Life Inspirations Behind Cersei Lannister\nLena Heady's Beacon 23 role is the perfect follow-up to the end of Game of Thrones because of the apparent similarities between Cersei and Aster. According to Beacon 23's description, \"James’ keeper begins to question whether Aster is friend or foe as her ability to disguise her agenda and motives could make her a formidable opponent.\" This definitely makes it clear that Aster isn't the hero that many main characters are, and in fact, she could be the source of villainy throughout the series. But also, with so little to go on, it could be that Aster is simply misunderstood, which ironically also aligns with Cersei in some ways.\nWhile some actors benefit from taking roles that are vastly different from what they've previously done, Heady's role as Aster being similar to Cersei is actually a good choice. Since audiences are already familiar with Heady's impressive performance as Cersei, it will be more exciting and gratifiying for them to see her in a similar state rather than in something entirely different or opposite. Ultimately, Aster harkens back to Cersei's nefarious characterization, but is distinct enough to not be repeating what viewers have already seen before.\nAnother great aspect of Aster being similar to Cersei is that it will subvert expectations. Game of Thrones fans may watch Beacon 23 and immediately see connections between Cersei and Aster. From there, they will assume that Aster is the bad guy. However, if Aster turns out to be more heroic than she originally seems, then this will come as an exciting shock to viewers.

{"title": "Pixar's Strategy Change Is A Worrying Sign For The Studio's Upcoming Sci-Fi Movie", "date": "2023-10-09 12:11:26", "text": "Pixar is looking to change its film strategy moving forward, and while this might be a good thing long-term, it could be detrimental to its new movie.\nPixar is known for crafting beautiful stories that have an impact on audiences across all demographics, but as the studio reevaluates its strategy moving forward, it could be creating a disaster for its upcoming sci-film, Elio. While Pixar has seen immense success over the past decades, the studio's ability to continue dominating the animation space has been questioned after some missteps. Lightyear, for example, was deemed an absolute box office failure, and Elemental's box office debut numbers were low after poor marketing on Disney's part. This has led the studio head to address how Pixar will be making changes moving forward in order to ensure future success.\nChief Creative Officer Pete Docter explained how Pixar will change in the wake of Elemental. He wants to take another look at projects currently in the works to ensure that the films are in line with the values and ideas that have allowed them to connect with audiences on such a deep level in the first place. While it may make sense in the future for the studio to return to simpler storylines and create fewer worlds with abstract characters that are harder for younger audiences to connect to, it'd make the most sense to put this re-shift on hold and not make any changes to Pixar's upcoming movie Elio.\nAlthough Pixar reevaluating its content strategy moving forward might be a smart move, it doesn't make much sense to change Elio at this point. The information revealed about the movie has already garnered a lot of positive attention, as it's exciting that this is a new Pixar story that is not another remake. In order for Pixar to make good on their plan to return to their simpler roots, there would have to be major changes made to Elio, a movie that seems to be quite different from their classic films like Toy Story and Finding Nemo.\nPixar changing anything major with Elio at this point could actually prove negative, as audiences may feel a great deal of disappointment after looking forward to the original storyline, and that might hurt the movie's success. It would create the same exact problem that Elemental faced, with the marketing materials not matching the film's real story and causing box office numbers to not be up to par with their previous releases.\nThe biggest problem that Elemental faced during its opening was that audiences did not have a clear understanding of what the film was about. This was due to poor marketing on Disney's part, as the initial trailers and teasers focused on the fact that Element City had residents who fell into different categories based on their elements. There was little shown about the actual storyline, including it being based on stories of immigration and having a Romeo and Juliet type of relationship. This led to Elemental having one of the lowest Pixar debuts of all time.\nElio has already done a much better job at marketing, fixing Elemental's major mistake. Viewers can clearly tell what the movie is about from the trailer. The promotional materials clearly convey that the film is going to be about a young boy named Elio who is transported across the galaxy when he's thought to be the ambassador of Earth. Since the trailer is clear, audiences have enough information to make an informed decision whether they want to watch it, which was not the case for Elemental. Considering Elio is off to a strong start, the studio should refrain from changing anything.\nIf you asked Aleena Malik at any point in her life what her passion was, she would confidently tell you it was writing.

{"title": "&quot;Being A Jedi Feels Inaccessible Sometimes&quot;: Ahsoka Star Explains Why Sabine Is Such A Relatable Jedi", "date": "2023-10-09 12:08:24", "text": "Now that Ahsoka has made Sabine Wren a Jedi, star Natasha Liu Bordizzo has outlined why the Mandalorian is such a relatable Force wielder.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka.\nAhsoka episode 8 officially made Sabine Wren a Jedi, with star Natasha Liu Bordizzo explaining why the Mandalorian is so relatable after her huge journey. Ahsoka began with an unexpected plot twist from the ending of Star Wars Rebels after revealing that Sabine had begun Jedi training under Ahsoka's tutelage after the former show ended. This led many to wonder if Sabine would become Force-sensitive, something that the most recent Star Wars Disney+ show certainly hinted at before Ahsoka's ending and finale confirmed Sabine's Force powers.\nRelated: Sabine Wren Is Officially A Jedi Now\nAfter this huge reveal, Sabine actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo was featured exploring her character's journey on Star Wars' YouTube channel. The video, recorded before the SAG-AFTRA strikes, features Bordizzo delving deeper into Sabine's psyche in Ahsoka, from her relatable struggles with accessing the Force to her imperfect choices that give her character a sense of realness. Bordizzo also explains that \"there's so much about being a Jedi... that feels inaccessible sometimes\" and highlights this as a core reason why Sabine's Ahsoka journey worked so well.\nStemming from Bordizzo's comments, it becomes even more clear why Sabine's character in Ahsoka is more relatable than other Jedi. Since the beginning of the Skywalker Saga, especially in the prequel trilogy, so many Jedi were portrayed as ethereal Force beings who rarely showed emotion and always did what was right. What made characters like Luke Skywalker and Rey Skywalker different concerning the original and sequel trilogies respectively is that they were not raised as Jedi meaning their more human personalities helped them become relatable main characters.\nWith Sabine, the same can be said with Bordizzo commenting that Sabine has not \"achieved this transcendent state.\" Even more so in Sabine's case though, she is not someone inherently gifted in the Force as Luke and Rey were. Bordizzo points out that Sabine has to struggle to become a Jedi, something shown at length in Ahsoka. This makes her much more relatable than the Star Wars character with inherent gifts and abilities and makes Sabine in Ahsoka come across as much more human, elevating her character as a result.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are now streaming on Disney+.\nSource: Star Wars\n"}

Their leader, who would come to be known simply as Pinhead, fast became counted among the likes of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers.\n Working primarily behind the camera, actor and director John Krasinksi followed up his smash hit sci-fi horror thriller A Quiet Place with an even more ambitious sequel that further explored his post-apocalyptic world overrun by ruthlessly effective alien monsters that hunt by sound.\nPart II expands both the scope and the cast of what looks to be a successful cinematic franchise with bigger action sequences and star Cillian Murphy joining the ensemble, setting up an even grander third installment.\n A visceral horror film that's full of gore and brutality, The Descent has stood the test of time thanks in large part to its well-drawn characters and emotional performances. The all-female cast shuck many of the norms of the genre for a monster movie that holds nothing back but still finds ways to be subtle with its subplots and relationship dynamics.\nThe story sees a group of thrill-seeking friends become trapped within an uncharted cave system, soon discovering that a horrific presence hunts them in the dark. It's an unforgivingly intense ride, but an undeniably enjoyable one for fans who need their horror to have a little extra kick.\n Set in a sleepy Korean community in the country, The Wailing follows a comically incompetent cop as the local people begin to experience a wave of bizarre and violent murders with inexplicable motivations. Signs point to a mysterious Japanese man who arrived in the area not long ago but nothing is certain in this twist-filled horror story.\nThe effortlessness with which the movie switches between physical comedy and supernatural horror is impressive within itself, not to mention its gorgeous scenery and cinematography, making it a unique experience and a modern must-watch.\n This classic horror comedy mixes together surreal body horror with quintessential 80s humor when an American tourist is attacked by a werewolf and begins a bloody journey of transformation.\nBursting with creativity, the Oscar-winning effects of make-up maestro Rick Baker make An American Werewolf in London an undeniable top dog within the niche of werewolf movies.\n Adapted from the novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin revolves around the complex relationship between a mother and her worryingly antisocial son.\nJumping back and forth through time, the most horrific reveals are saved for last, but the palpable sense of dread is kept high all the way through. The audience knows from the beginning that Kevin's actions have led to something truly unforgivable, with his deeds automatically reflecting on his mother. The film is a fearless exploration of postnatal feelings of anxiety, but they're delivered in such a way that anyone can relate to them.\n This crowd-pleasing zombie movie has opened doors for many into the wider world of South Korean cinema and breathed new life into a genre that had appeared to be played out.\nPassengers aboard the titular train fight hordes of the undead while dealing with a feast of the kind of relatable-yet-culturally-distinct drama that South Korea has become so famous for the world over. As either a viewer's first Korean film, zombie film, or both, Train to Busan is a great choice.\n Nowadays, the idea of zombies and the undead has exploded into the world of Hollywood. From films to TV series, zombie films have grown to the point of becoming overused and cliched, with many forgetting where they came from.\nBack in 1968, the late great George A. Romero released what was his debut film, Night of the Living Dead, a masterpiece of horror that for the first time, brought the undead to life on the big screen. With simple yet effective effects and storytelling, Night of the Living Dead will remain a pinnacle of the horror genre for generations to come.\n An eerily beautiful and chillingly sinister take on the tropes of vampire fiction, Let the Right One In mixes coming-of-age romance with intermittently brutal violence when a young boy forms a bond with a girl who harbors a dark secret.\nBoth daring and original, this widely-acclaimed Swedish film demonstrates the range of diversity that subscribers can expect from the best horror movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n To this day the only horror movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars, The Silence of the Lambs offers viewers often-imitated but still unmatched levels of drama and disturbing thrills as Jodie Foster's young FBI trainee hunts a serial killer with the help of the devilishly intelligent murderer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter.\nHopkins' performance as Lecter, whilst not the first interpretation of the character to be seen on the big screen, became the yardstick by which all murderous masterminds in movies would be judged, making this a certifiable must-see.\nNEXT: The 10 Best Psychological Thriller Movies On Amazon Prime Video \nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

{"title": "Grand Admiral Thrawn's Creator Would Have Told A Very Different Ahsoka Story", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Grand Admiral Thrawn has finally debuted in live-action thanks to Ahsoka, though Thrawn's creator Timothy Zahn would have done things differently.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka\nGrand Admiral Thrawn made his live-action Star Wars debut in the new Ahsoka Disney+ TV show. As seen in Ahsoka's finale, the Imperial leader also made his epic return to the known galaxy after years spent in exile. While Thrawn's original creator would have done things differently, it can be argued that author Timothy Zahn and Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni see the Grand Admiral himself differently as well.\nHaving been created by Timothy Zahn in the early 90s for the Thrawn trilogy of novels beginning with Heir to the Empire, the powerful Grand Admiral was brought back into the established Disney canon by Filoni for the Star Wars Rebels series as well as in new canonical books from Zahn himself. Surprisingly, it seems Zahn would have likely depicted Thrawn's exile differently than was seen in Ahsoka, having confirmed as much during a 2021 panel (quote courtesy of @eleventhirtyate):\n\"The question was what I would do to bring Thrawn back after nine years of vanishing... It seems to me that what we need to do is set up some kind of reluctant buddy thing between Thrawn and Ezra. The way I see it is that Thrawn persuades Ezra that there are worse things out there even than the Empire. The Empire has an all bunch of Rebels fighting against it; this is something that you and you alone can help us defeat. So, if Thrawn can persuade Ezra to work with him, reluctantly, probably, but I think that that would be the basis for the story. Think back to... one of my favorite examples of this is the tv show \"White Collar\": they don't really trust each other, but they work well together. So I think it would be something of that same flavor. Ezra would never be quite trusting Thrawn, looking for \"what angle is he playing, what he is trying to get me to do that I shouldn't be doing.\" At the same time, Thrawn is, \"I need your assistance; how do I get this from you without making you bolt.\" So there is a lot of interesting byplay. And, of course, you can bring people like Eli Vanto to talk to Ezra. \"Yes, I was an Imperial; now I am working with these guys because I recognize that there are more dangerous things out there as well.\" So there is a whole bunch of interesting dynamics that you can put together.\"\nWhile the idea of Thrawn and Jedi Ezra Bridger reluctantly joining forces is compelling, it seems to be predicated on how Zahn views the Grand Admiral (compared to Filoni).\nRelated: Ahsoka Ending Explained In Full\nClearly, Zahn's approach to Thrawn would have been quite different. Firstly, there's the justifiable assumption that Thrawn and Ezra were exiled to the Unknown Regions following the series finale of Star Wars Rebels. After all, these comments were two years before Ahsoka's twist regarding Peridea and its existence in another galaxy entirely. This is why Zahn mentions Eli Vanto, Thrawn's greatest ally as he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Navy who became an Imperial liaison with Thrawn's people the Chiss (while Thrawn himself continued serving the Empire).\nIn Zahn's books, Thrawn is far more of a quasi-heroic figure, having viewed the Empire prior to his exile as a necessary evil to protect the Chiss from various threats in the Unknown Regions (many of which were established by Zahn himself). In that light, convincing Ezra to form an alliance in the face of new threats beyond the Empire makes sense. However, Filoni seems to view Thrawn as more of an outright villain seeking to claim leadership of the Empire following his return in Ahsoka's finale. Ironically, this seems to be more in line with Zahn's original Legends characterization for Thrawn from Heir to the Empire, because the author's portrayal changed gradually as he increasingly fell in love with the character he had created. It's ironic that there are now technically two contrasting interpretations of Thrawn in Star Wars canon.\nSource: Twitter\n"}
{"title": "John Wick 5 Has Much Bigger Keanu Reeves Problem Than John's Death", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "John’s death in John Wick: Chapter 4 is a problem that needs solving in the next film, but there’s another, bigger problem that needs solving too.\nThe end of John Wick: Chapter 4 sees the franchise's main character succumb to his wounds, and though the next movie will have to figure out how to bring John back, their bigger problem is what they will do after that. John Wick is a neo-noir action franchise that first began in 2014, and has since spawned three sequel films, with more on the way. Starring Keanu Reeves, John Wick is a beloved franchise that has cemented itself among the greats, however, the latest movie's ending could be a major roadblock for the franchise's future.\nReleased in 2023, John Wick: Chapter 4 follows Wick as he takes his fight against the High Table to a global scale, searching for the most powerful criminals around the world. The film's final battle includes John taking on the High Table's The Marquis in a duel, that proves to be bloody even before their guns are drawn. At the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, John successfully kills The Marquis, but ultimately dies afterward. It isn't uncommon for action heroes to die before their story is complete, so the real question that remains is this: how will John Wick continue after his resurrection?\nRelated: 8 Signs John Wick 5 With Keanu Reeves Will Happen (Despite Chapter 4's Ending)\nThough it isn't confirmed that John Wick will bring its beloved protagonist back to life, if they do, there will be stipulations. First and foremost, if the franchise kills then revives John Wick, that means that they can never try to kill him again. This is because audiences will no longer trust that a death is truly a death. If John can be resurrected once, why couldn't he be resurrected every time? Even if the franchise does kill John Wick for good in a later movie, it would feel unsatisfying to an audience that has already seen him \"die\" once before.\nAlong with the fact that a second John Wick death would be unbelievable, it would also be boring. Killing a character is quite an extreme, and now that John Wick has gone there once, it would be repetitive to try and go there again. No matter how much the film tries to switch things up, ultimately, the end result would be the same. John Wick's death was sad in John Wick: Chapter 4, and it is almost a guarantee that if it were to happen again, it would be much less sad, and would automatically make audiences think he was coming back again like the first time.\nNow that John Wick has essentially played its single \"kill John Wick\" card, this raises questions about how the franchise will end. Typically, an action franchise can end with a bang if it kills off its main character, and more often than not, these deaths will be followed by resurrections that are hinted at in end credits scenes or final shots. John Wick obviously can't end the franchise like this because they will have already done it before. So, how can the John Wick franchise end without killing or resurrecting John Wick?\nEnding the franchise with John living isn't the worst thing in the world. It certainly isn't as dramatic as death, but it would likely make for a happier ending that could satisfy audiences in a variety of ways. If John succeeds in taking down the High Table, and then lives to see another day, that would certainly call for celebration. Furthermore, if John is able to return to a life of normalcy, that could be a pleasant ending as well. Really, the best thing the franchise can do if John survives is giving him exactly what he wants. Therefore, John and the audience will be satisfied.\nUltimately, John Wick may have killed off John too early. The franchise creator, Chad Stahelski reportedly has ideas for the franchise up until John Wick 9, and if this becomes a reality, then John's death will definitely feel premature in the grand scheme of things. The main concern is that the franchise won't be able to top killing off the main character. And as previously mentioned, once a franchise uses the death card, they really shouldn't use it again. Therefore, John's death in John Wick: Chapter 4 leaves many questions as to where the John Wick franchise is headed, and whether it will be any good.\n"}
{"title": "Vegeta Is A Lot More Like Goku Than He Will Ever Admit", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Despite the fact that Vegeta and Goku are famous rivals in Dragon Ball canon, the Saiyan Prince is way more like Kakarot than he would like to admit. \nVegeta and Goku are two of the most iconic rivals in anime history, and while it’s true that their rivalry has become one of respect, brotherhood, and mutually-assured progression, it’s still a rivalry nonetheless. Vegeta craves his own glory and significance apart from Goku, despite spending much of his time in Dragon Ball canon standing in Goku’s seemingly ever-present shadow. However, as essentially confirmed in Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta’s actually a lot more like Goku than he will ever admit.\nThe two Saiyan warriors first crossed paths in the earliest days of Dragon Ball Z, back when Vegeta was still evil and wanted to kill all life on Planet Earth. After Vegeta found redemption by aligning himself with the Z-Fighters against Frieza, he started to use Goku as someone he could compare himself to while he trained solo. While this method yielded amazing results - including Vegeta unlocking a state beyond Super Saiyan before Goku - he found that training this way kept him perpetually behind Goku. So, after Vegeta’s existential freak-out in the form of becoming Majin Vegeta during the Majin Buu Saga, he accepted his role as Goku’s training partner. However, Vegeta never lost that edge that makes him crave superiority over Goku, and to be more than just a carbon-copy of his Saiyan rival. Unfortunately, it’s for this reason that Vegeta would assuredly find it upsetting that he is - in fact - very similar to Goku, and in more ways than just their power levels.\nIn Dragon Ball Super chapter 76 by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou, Vegeta admits that he failed to perfect Hakai (otherwise known as Destruction) because he couldn’t be the callous, unfeeling, power-hungry man he was at the start of his Dragon Ball career. In using Hakai, one essentially wills something out of existence, destroying every aspect of it entirely. Therefore, one must be unwavering in the mindset of total destruction, especially in terms of whatever person or object they want to destroy. To have that mindset, one has to be pretty callous, and Vegeta found that he’s just not anymore - and Goku discovered something similar a few chapters earlier.\nIn Dragon Ball Super chapter 25, Goku tried to use Hakai against Zamasu, as he figured that was the only way to eliminate this beyond-god-tier villain. However, because Goku is pure of heart, the attack had little effect. While it’s true that Zamasu mounted a number of defenses against anything these Saiyans could have thrown at him (which is why it took Zeno to finally put him down), the line of logic created with Vegeta’s explanation of his shortcoming can be backtracked to Goku’s failure in using Hakai as well. This means that throughout all that time during Dragon Ball Z while Vegeta was watching Goku and trying to attain his level of power, he picked up something from the Saiyan hero that he didn’t mean to: goodness.\nVegeta went from being a literal destroyer of worlds - someone who would kill those closest to him like it was nothing - to a cosmic fighter of evil and protector of the very planet he once threatened. No longer was he this unfeeling agent of evil, but instead - like Goku - is someone who’s relatively pure of heart. While his actions in later DBZ and throughout Dragon Ball Super confirm this alone, there’s no better side-by-side comparison than Goku and Vegeta’s respective failures in utilizing Hakai, as that proved Vegeta is more like Goku than he’ll ever admit.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "1 Loki Character Secretly Sets Up The MCU's Reset After Avengers 6", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "The season 2 premiere of Loki hints at a potential post-Avengers 6 plot twist for the MCU thanks to the introduction of one TVA character.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1The Loki season 2 premiere introduces a new character that will undoubtedly play a key role throughout the season - and might well also set up the future of the MCU. Played by Academy Award-winning actor Ke Huy Quan, Ouroboros is introduced in the Loki season 2 cast as the head of the TVA’s Repairs and Advancement department. The fact that O.B. seems to be the only employee of the TVA who hasn’t had their memory wiped already establishes him as someone to watch out for, and the fact that he wrote the TVA guidebook means he knows the ins and outs of the TVA better than anyone.\nBesides the fact that O.B.’s character is clearly essential to the TVA, the whole meaning behind his character could actually be Loki season 2 hinting at the greater future of the MCU, in the same way Loki season 1 ending unveiled much about the franchise's multiverse. Ouroboros’ name is obviously a reference to the ancient Greek symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often a symbol for the cycle of life, death, and rebirth - which may be a nod to a possible future MCU plot point.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Ending Explained\nThe image of a snake eating itself can represent the idea of all time being an inevitable circle. Time may work differently in the TVA, but Ouroboros’ presence could be a hint that the cycle will catch up with the TVA regardless, or even the greater MCU. With the MCU’s new era being called the Multiverse Saga, it makes sense that everything that has transpired in Loki thus far is hinting toward another multiversal war. Considering that Kang the Conqueror will be the big threat, the upcoming war is sure to draw parallels to the first.\nStarted by Kang and fought between his variants, the first multiversal war ended in the creation of the TVA and most importantly, the Sacred Timeline. To this day, any timeline that diverges from the Sacred Timeline is destroyed, and this could be a hint at the result of the Multiverse Saga’s war. The most probable outcome of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret War would be one timeline coming out on top as the new Sacred Timeline of sorts, and it might not be the MCU’s original Earth-616 universe doing so.\nHaving the concept of the multiverse for the upcoming Avengers films is the perfect chance for Marvel to reset the MCU. After all is said and done in the Multiverse Saga, the MCU has the opportunity to conclude Earth-616’s arc and set up another universe. This universe may feature Marvel characters that are already established to audiences, but resetting the MCU may put their stories back at square one. Representing the ouroboros’ idea of life, death, and rebirth, O.B.’s presence is a hint at an MCU reset that could work to the franchise’s advantage.\nThe theme of repetition is clearly present in both the Loki series and Loki himself as a character. As the God of Mischief, Loki has always been about playing tricks. He’s known for constantly switching to the side that will benefit him most, and his brother Thor has been on the receiving end of Loki’s constant loop of betrayal and loyalty. With how many times he’s cheated death, he lives in a state of repetition that has only intensified since arriving at the TVA considering Loki’s already been pruned twice.\nLoki season 2, episode 1 even uses the motif of repetition as a storytelling device, most notably in O.B.’s introduction scene. After Loki time-slips into the past, the conversation with O.B. is played out back-to-back with Mobius’ in the present. The repeated conversation creates memories for O.B. in real time, showing how influential the time cycle can actually be. It also might not be a coincidence that the biggest example of repetition happened with Ouroboros, the character that literally represents time and life as a cycle.\nOuroboros is sure to play an even bigger role beyond the first episode of Loki season 2, especially looking into the deeper meaning of what he represents. His symbolism of time as a cycle may come into play in the MCU’s upcoming multiversal war, even giving an opportunity for Marvel to reset the franchise. Considering how a reset of the MCU could take the franchise into a new direction after all these years, O.B.’s secret setup may be more crucial than meets the eye.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}

Jingliu became available as a playable character in Honkai: Star Rail 1.4, along with Guinaifen and Topaz. She is a 5-star character who uses Ice in combat and follows the Path of the Destruction. Jingliu has a unique gameplay kit, which sees her drain the HP of her own allies.\nWhile Jingliu plays a risky game by pulling HP from her party, this is compensated for in more damage output against her enemies. Even with the high risks she may pose, Jingliu has the potential to be one of the strongest DPS characters in Honkai: Star Rail, provided that she is given the proper build and team comp. Of course, the first step to worry about is gathering the proper materials to pass the Ascension thresholds that limit Jingliu from being leveled to 80 immediately, so that you can max her out and unlock all of her powers. This also includes farming for her Traces, the name for her abilities.\nRelated: Honkai: Star Rail - Lynx Character Ascension (& Materials)\nThe first set of items that you will need to farm for Jingiu’s Ascension is Immortal Scionette and its evolutions, Immortal Aeroblossom and Immortal Lumintwig, respectively. These items have been available in the game since launch, so you may already have a few lying around in your inventory.\nIf not, you will need to farm this item family from varied Abundance Spirits, Mara-Struck Soldiers, Aurumaton Gatekeepers, Disiciples of Sanctus Medicus, and even the Ascended in Honkai: Star Rail. Most of these creatures are primarily found all across the Xianzhou Luofu maps, such as Cloudford, but they can also be encountered in the Simulated Universe.\nYou can and should use the Synthesizer to transform 3x Scionette into 1x Aeroblossom and 3x Aeroblossom into 1x Lumintwig. As you progress through the Ascension levels, rarer materials are needed, so using lower-quality ones to great what is required is a vital part of the Ascension process. The Synthesizer should later be used for Jingliu’s Traces as well.\nWhile not too many are actually needed for the Ascension process itself, it is wise to farm a surplus of Immortal Scionette and its evolutions. This is because you will need a lot more for Jingliu’s Traces. Her skill tree fully unlocks after getting her to level 80, but while you are already farming these items, try to get more. The second set of items needed for Jingliu’s Ascension is Gelid Chitin. This item is an Ascension-exclusive item and can only be obtained from a Stagnant Shadow challenge in Honkai: Star Rail. To obtain it, you will need to travel to Luofu’s Cloudford map.\nThere, you will encounter Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Icicle. Beating this challenge will drop a few copies of Gelid Chitin. As a total of 65x Gelid Chitin is needed for Jingliu’s complete Ascension process, you will likely need to run this battle a few times. For reference, this is the same Stagnant Shadow needed for Yanqing’s Ascension in Honkai: Star Rail, so if you have already leveled the 5-star Hunt character, you may have a few leftovers. The table below lists all the materials needed for each of Jingliu’s Ascension levels, as well as the rewards for completing the Ascension:\nJingliu Ascension Materials & Rewards In Honkai: Star Rail\nLevel Ascension\nMaterials\nRewards\nLevel 20 Ascension\n \n \nLevel 30 Ascension\n \n-\nLevel 40 Ascension\n \n \nLevel 50 Ascension\n \n-\nLevel 60 Ascension\n \n \nLevel 70 Ascension\n \n-\nTotal Materials\n \n \nThe exact amount of each material may vary a bit as this is based on other 5-star characters' needs and leaks shared by Eurogamer, though the materials themselves are correct.\nOther than that, you will need a total of 308,000x Credits for the entire process – this is not too large an amount, especially when compared to the amount required for Trace leveling. The Ascension process for Jingliu may take a few days, as there is also a daily limit on Trailblaze Power in Honkai: Star Rail, the resource you use to challenge Stagnant Shadows and other activities in the game. Regardless, this is the easiest part of the process, as leveling her Traces will be a lot more time-consuming due to the sheer number of resources you will need to collect.\nAfter completing the Ascension process, you can comfortably start farming materials for Jingliu’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail. This is the most troublesome part of maxing out a character, other than farming Relics and hoping for one with the best stats to actually drop. Immortal Scionette and its evolutions, Immortal Aeroblossom and Immortal Lumintwig are needed for her Traces as well.\nDifferent from her Ascension, however, a much more demanding amount is required: you will need 41x Immortal Scionette, 56x Immortal Aeroblossom, and 58x Immortal Lumintwig. This is why you should go ahead and farm a surplus when gathering for the Ascension.\nAs the level of Jingliu’s Traces increases, so does the quality of the items she requires. Using the Synthesizer to craft what you need is the best way to optimize your gains. This is also true for the second group of items needed for her abilities, the Blades in Honkai: Star Rail.\nThe Shattered Blade, Lifeless Blade, and Worldbreaker Blade are demanded in huge quantities, so you will not only need to farm a lot but start transforming lower-quality materials into higher-quality materials. Although they can be obtained from World Shops and the Embers Exchange Store, the best source for these items is the Calyx (Crimson): Bud of Destruction.\nYou will likely need to challenge this domain several times in order to get all that is needed. For higher-level Traces, you will need a special item called Regret of Infinite Ochema. A total of 12x is needed, so you do not need to farm these incessantly. They drop from Phantylia in Honkai: Star Rail. Nevertheless, given there is a cap on weekly boss challenges, it may take some time to gather all 12x Regret of Infinite Ochema. The table below lists all the materials needed to max out Jingliu’s Traces:\nJingliu Trace Materials In Honkai: Star Rail\nImmortal Scionette\n \nImmortal Aeroblossom\n \nImmortal Lumintwig\n \nShattered Blade\n \nLifeless Blade\n \nWorldbreaker Blade\n \nRegret of Infinite Ochema\n \nTracks of Destiny\n \nCredit\n \nThe high-leveled Traces will also require some Tracks of Destiny. A total of 8x is needed to max out Jingliu. These can be obtained from special events, the Simulated Universe, Nameless Honor, and the Embers Exchange Store. The process of powering through all of Jingliu’s Ascension thresholds and then maxing out her Traces is one that demands some time and dedication, but one that is worthwhile as Jingliu is one of the most menacing DPS characters in Honkai: Star Rail so far.\nSource: Eurogamer\n"}
{"title": "Starfield Makes You Friends With The Worst Parent In The Multiverse", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Among Starfield’s companions, one is very charismatic, but his treatment of his daughter makes it clear that he is a cosmically unfit parent. \nIn Starfield, players will spend time with several members of Constellation — the society of spacefaring explorers — but one member stands out for all the wrong reasons, thanks to terrible parenting skills, which are possibly the worst in the multiverse. The cowboy hat-wearing Sam Coe is one of the most distinct companions in Starfield, thanks in part to his anachronistic appearance but more so due to his daughter, Cora Coe. Cora is the archetypal precocious youth, a 12-year-old girl with knowledge well beyond her years. Sam repeatedly endangers Cora throughout Starfield’s story, making him an unfit parent, before committing the most profound act of child abandonment possible.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Starfield's ending.]\nSome may think Sam is one of Starfield’s best companions, thanks to his charm and the complexity of his backstory. Though Sam may be likable, his insistence on bringing his preteen daughter along on dangerous missions already renders his parenting skills suspect. Perhaps the developers thought the dialogue exchanges with Cora on the ship added energy and character development to Sam’s missions. Sam does not bring Cora into the field to dodge gunfire, but she could be onboard for spaceship battles outside the atmosphere of planets. Whatever value Cora’s presence might bring to the game’s storytelling, few players can ignore the fact that Sam is putting his child in danger.\nRelated: \"An Instant Classic\": Starfield Review\nNot every Constellation member acts as a field agent, as several remain behind at the Constellation Lodge on New Atlantis. Vladimir generally stays at The Eye, the space station from which he locates the sites where the player uncovers additional powers. Cora could have interacted with the player and her father during visits to the Lodge, but Starfield has Sam insist she accompany him on missions. This already casts Sam’s parenting skills in a poor light, but it is Starfield’s endgame that provides the most damning evidence. Bringing Cora on away missions is at least a way to keep her close, but Sam ultimately abandons her profoundly.\nPlayers who speed towards Starfield’s ending or complete it after exploring myriad side quests eventually learn the secret of the artifacts and discover the method to reach Unity at the center of the universe. Breaching Unity allows a human to become a Starborn, a process in which their physical body is destroyed and reconstituted in an entirely new universe. There are no “family packages” allowed when becoming a Starborn. Each person is separated from everyone they know and love in exchange for the chance to explore another reality. Sam not only elects to enter Unity himself, he allows his 12-year-old daughter to do the same.\nBy the final stages of Starfield’s main story, Sam is fully aware that being a Starborn is dangerous. The eternal feud between The Hunter and The Emissary carries over into other dimensions. Starborn compete for relics and the powers that are housed in the mysterious temples. Additionally, they are left as a lone individual in a universe that has no place for them. Their alternate self might be alive or dead, and they might meet doppelgängers of their friends and family, but these are not the people they knew, in truth. By becoming a Starborn, Cora is thrust into an unfamiliar universe, abandoned by her father due to relentless curiosity.\nThe desire to explore the unknown and decipher the universe’s mysteries is the driving force of Constellation, and a goal shared by Sam and Cora. Sam views The Unity, and the universes that lie beyond it, as the ultimate mystery, a truly unexplored frontier. If Sam had struggled with his desire to see what lies on the other side, before finally deciding to stay to raise his daughter, it could have been a powerful resolution to his character arc. Even a decision to pass through The Unity, leaving his daughter for other members of Constellation to raise her, would have been selfish, but Sam’s mistakes went much further.\nRelated: How To Recruit Every Companion & Crew Member In Starfield\nCora may have been willing to part ways with her father to become a Starborn, but she is still a 12-year-old child. Entering The Unity is irreversible, and given the limitless permutations of the multiverse, the chances of the original Sam and Cora ever crossing paths again are infinitesimal. Sam chose his passion for exploration over his love for his daughter and essentially cast her adrift in an unfamiliar universe without anyone at all to support her. For the player, Starfield’s New Game Plus continues the story, but for Sam and Cora, it is the end of their relationship as father and daughter.\nCasting Cora as a preteen may have been a mistake since this parting might have played out as less uncomfortable with a more aged Sam and Cora. The theme of a parent letting their child go out into the world, trusting they did everything they could to impart life lessons, could be a poignant ending to the story of the Coe family. No matter how intelligent she might be, Cora is still 12. She may devour books and have an expansive skill set for her age, but she is not prepared to face life alone, much less a life marooned in an unknown dimension.\nPlayers who complete multiple journeys through The Unity, exploring a series of permutations of reality, may encounter an adult, Starborn Cora. If they allowed Sam to die in Starfield’s High Price To Pay mission, she will be hellbent on getting revenge on the protagonist whom she blames for her father’s death. In a reality where Sam has died, Cora might have pursued The Unity on her own as an adult. In any universe where Sam lived, he should have spent more time with his daughter before parting ways eternally through a trip into The Unity. Given the choice between his curiosity and his responsibilities, Sam made the wrong call.\nThe poor storytelling of Starfield may have made Sam’s negligence less evident than it should have been. While a more cinematic approach could have improved characterization, some may have a negative experience with the narrative since the game always prioritizes non-linear gameplay over character development. The trope of underage heroes going into battle is fairly commonplace in JRPGs and other less grounded stories. Starfield attempts to present a realistic universe closer to the hard sci-fi of Star Trek than the space fantasy of Star Wars. Taking a child into dangerous situations is already troubling, but Sam hurts Starfield with his abandonment of Cora in the multiverse, souring the ending.\nDerek Garcia is a Game Feature Writer for ScreenRant.

Known for playing hunky characters, Phillips has already appeared in several pieces of iconic queer media, and his identity is very much a part of his burgeoning career. Despite his playing several notable \"Himbo\" characters, Phillips has also shown a diversity in his roles that speaks to his abilities as a true performer.\nAfter making a few appearances in various short films and background spots on shows like Madame Secretary, Phillips landed his first major role in 2022, and it came in a feature film no less. Joining the cast of Fire Island plucked Phillips out of relative obscurity, and he has already played a host of great characters in the years since. Though he has yet to return to the big screen, his TV work has allowed him to broaden his horizons and be so much more than a set of muscles.\nRELATED: How Fire Island Compares To Pride & Prejudice \nCanceled after only one season on Netflix, Partner Track was nothing special, but it didn't allow Phillips to get more air time. The series follows lawyer Ingrid (Arden Cho) who tries to climb the ladder and become a partner at a prestigious New York law firm. Phillips appeared in six episodes as Hunter Reed, a meathead lawyer who gets advantages over Ingrid because he is a man. Though the series was a flop, Zane Phillips was funny in nearly every scene that he stole.\nJoining the Vampire Diaries spinoff Legacies in its fourth and final season, Zane Phillips was tapped to play an entirely original character that is unlike any of his other credits so far. The series follows a new generation of characters in Mystic Falls who must protect it from a host of supernatural goings-on. As Ben, Phillips imbued the demi-god with a rare stroke of humanity, and though Ben's Legacies villain twist was poorly executed, it gave the up-and-comer a chance to have layers.\nThe queer rom-com Fire Island adapted the classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen but with a decidedly modern twist. In the film, a group of queer friends meet for their annual trip, but find their bonds tested like never before. In his first major role, Phillips was tapped to play the rakish Dex who had a somewhat villainous side. Of the character, Phillips said in an interview with Pop Culturist that if things \"had been different along the way, this could have been who I was\" showing the young actor was more than capable of finding bits of himself in the character, even if it was unpleasant.\nRELATED: Fire Island's Main Characters Ranked By Likability\nOnce again returning in a Netflix original series, Zane Phillips' turn in Glamorous has been his most distinct to date. In the show, Marco (Miss Benny) lands the job of a lifetime working for a legendary makeup mogul which inspires them to revolutionize the industry. When speaking about the show to Man About Town, Phillips summed it up as \"a joyous expression on what it means to be queer in life, in work and in relationships\", while his character of Chad offered him yet another multi-layered persona to sink into. Chad struggles to understand Marco's identity but grows from a villain to an ally.\nDalton is a freelance writer, novelist, and filmmaker from Orlando Florida.

{"title": "WWE Backlash 2023: Bad Bunny's Fight, Cody Rhodes Vs. Brock Lesnar & Everything To Know About The Event", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "WWE Backlash 2023 brought all the high-flying intensity and dramatic storylines expected of a wrestling PPV event. Here's the rundown of the matches.\nWWE Backlash 2023 was an exciting and action-packed thrill ride featuring some classic wrestling stars like Brock Lesnar as well as newcomers like rapper Bad Bunny. WWE Backlash is a PPV wrestling event that began in 1999. It was originally set up as a replacement for the \"In Your House\" PPV shows which were held between the major WWE pay-per-views: Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. The original \"gimmick\" of the series was that it was a \"backlash\" to the flagship WrestleMania event and held the post-WrestleMania position from inception until 2010, when it was canceled for Extreme Rules, only to be renewed in 2016.\nAs one of the main WWE PPV events, Backlash consistently has some of the most exciting matches of the year between wrestlers fighting to keep their belts, upstarts looking to make names for themselves, and former stars hoping to get back in the spotlight. WWE Backlash 2023 is the 18th Backlash event and features notable wrestlers from Bianca Belair to Austin Theory to Cody Rhodes. Kayfabe, high-flying stunts, and some important storylines round out the highly regarded WWE Backlash 2023.\nRelated: Reason Why Cody Rhodes Entered The Royal Rumble At No. 30 Revealed\nWWE Backlash 2023 aired on May 6, 2023, just over a month after WrestleMania 39. The event took place at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico, making it only the second time a Backlash event has taken place outside the continental United States, the first being in 2004 when the event played in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The wrestling event was available for PPV but Peacock and the WWE Network subscribers could also stream the matches, just as they can any Backlash events.\nThe event opened with Bianca Belair defending her Raw Women's Championship belt from Iyo Sky. It was an aggressive match between the two women and even though Sky was the challenger, there were moments when the crowd was clearly actively rooting for her against Belair, turning her from a babyface into something approaching a heel. However, even the crowds' reaction and the surprise appearance of Sky's team Damage CTRL could not stop Belair. The veteran wrestler performed her signature Kiss of Death finisher to break Becky Lynch's record of 400 days with the belt.\nThe second bout of WWE Backlash 2023 saw Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins up against Omos. Before the match even began, the Nigerian giant Omos kicked Rollins in the chest to set the tone. It was one of Omos' best bouts who, notoriously, has often had slow ones, and the 7' 3\" wrestler seemed energized by the crowd. Omos got a huge choke slam on Rollins late in the match, but the smaller wrestler was able to land multiple Stomps, including one from the top rope that gave him the win.\nAustin Theory, Bobby Lashley, and Bronson Reed fought in a Triple Threat match for the United States Championship match. Like so often happens in Triple Threat matches, two of the wrestlers paired up for a careful truce to take out the stronger one. Theory fought Lashley and Reed together who continually broke up each other's pin attempts, but eventually, it was each man for himself. As the defending champion, Theory was set up to win, but Reed received audible crowd support throughout the night. Theory ended up tossing Lashley out of the ring and pinning Reed to retain his title.\nThe SmackDown Women's Championship featured current belt holder Rhea Ripley and Zelina Vega, WWE's only female wrestler of Puerto Rican descent. She strode into the arena wrapped in a Puerto Rican flag to the cheers of the crowd. The match looked to be ending quickly, with Ripley easily picking apart Vega, but a second wind by the challenger almost saw her mount a comeback. However, Ripley's signature Riptide slam ended the match and the fighter kept her title. In a great moment of national pride, Vega received a standing ovation from the Puerto Rican crowd for her performance.\nOne of the most talked-about elements of WWE Backlash 2023 was that Puerto Rican-born rapper and actor Bad Bunny was slated to commentate, and when it was announced he would actually be fighting Damian Priest, excitement grew even more. The pair fought in a \"gimmick\" San Juan Street Fight that saw Bad Bunny with a shopping cart, weapons being used, and even some moments taking place in the stands, leading to an eventual win for Bad BUnny.\nBad Bunny's interest in wrestling is well known, and he has even been announced to play luchador crimefighter \"El Muerto\" in an upcoming Sony movie. Just hearing the crowd's reaction to Bad Bunny and his own entrance music makes this fight a must-watch.\nRelated: 5 Wrestlers With Great Acting Careers (& 5 Who Failed)\nWWE Backlash 2023 featured an exciting six-man tag team match between fierce foes the Bloodline and Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, and Matt Riddle. The Bloodline (Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, and Solo Sikoa), a villainous family team with a lot of infighting, are always fun to watch, particularly with how Sikoa often seems on the outside looking in during these matches, hesitating to high-five or hug his teammates. Throughout the match, Sikoa argued with the Usos leading to some mistakes, but he redeemed himself in the end, flying in under the ropes and performing the Samoan Spike on Riddle to win the match.\nThe main title fight of WWE Backlash 2023 came between Cody Rhodes and Brock Lesnar who only recently returned to televised wrestling. Rhodes and Lesnar clearly had a bone to pick with each other when Rhodes hit Lesnar with a piece of the announcer's table, a steel chair, and the steel steps before the match even started. When the match officially did begin, Rhodes immediately hit Lesnar with two of his high-flying drop-kicks, the Disaster Kick. On Rhodes' third attempt, Lesnar countered him with the always painful-looking German Suplex.\nRhodes and Lesnar traded moves until Lesnar tackled Rhodes into a corner of the ring with an exposed turnbuckle, causing him to bleed profusely. Fortunately, the match only lasted a little longer after. Lesnar got Rhodes in a Kimura pin, but Rhodes flipped him over to win the match. Lesnar left the ring looking visibly annoyed with his injury, but he did provide an excellent ending to WWE Backlash 2023.\n"}
{"title": "Daryl Dixon Episode 5's Ending Is A Nod To Another Walking Dead Spinoff (& Impacts The Finale)", "date": "2023-10-09 11:59:48", "text": "The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon showrunner David Zabel reveals how the ending of episode 5 is a nod to another spinoff - and is key to the finale.\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5!\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon showrunner David Zabel has revealed how the ending of episode 5 is a reference to another spinoff within the universe. The final scene of episode 5 sees Daryl forced into an arena by Genet and the Pouvoir, where he is forced to fight a zombie. However, the zombie is injected with a substance that turns it faster and more aggressive, revealing the variants likely originated from the Pouvoir's experiments.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Zabel explained how the ending to The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 was a reference to another spinoff, The Walking Dead: World Beyond. He revealed how a scene in World Beyond revealing fast zombies in France impacted how they approached variants in Daryl Dixon, teasing more information in the season finale. Check out what Zabel had to say below:\nWell, it's been something we've been hinting at all along. There have been clues to it played out throughout the episodes prior to this, and it is setting up to be a major obstacle for Daryl in the finale. So it's really setting that up, but it's also setting up a world in which it's a little bit of a kiss to World Beyond, because in World Beyond there was a little bit of a suggestion that there were different kinds of walkers in France. And so we kind of dug into that a little bit in terms of how and why they are different, and how they could be a good foil and a good new opponent for Daryl. So that's really what that's about, and it plays out fully in the finale.\nThe faster, stronger zombie Daryl will face in the season finale was created by the Pouvoir, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding zombie variants. The Walking Dead: World Beyond post-credits scene features a murdered character reanimate as a variant. This indicates there are certain variants that can arise naturally, meaning there is much more history to them than the Pouvoir's experiments.\nWhile Daryl will likely escape the arena and continue on his journey to the Nest with Isabelle and Laurent, that doesn't mean the danger of variant zombies is over. As encounters with Burners have proven, variants created by the Pouvoir can be found throughout France. It's likely Daryl and his group will encounter even more dangerous variants in their final push toward the Nest in the season finale.\nThe variants could also be tied to hints that Laurent is immune to the zombie virus. Perhaps something transpires that makes Genet or Codron realize Laurent could truly be key to stopping the zombies once and for all. However, it's yet to be confirmed if the circumstances of Laurent's birth mean he is immune. For now, it seems The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon finale will be highlighting the dangers of the variants, perhaps revealing more of their history in the process.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "Ben Affleck's Cut Batman Cameo In Aquaman Revealed Almost 5 Years Later", "date": "2023-10-09 11:50:25", "text": "The original Aquaman movie was supposed to have a cameo by Ben Affleck's Batman as new concept art has revealed what the DCEU movie had in store.\nFive years after Aquaman was released in theaters, Ben Affleck's Batman cameo gets revealed in new DCEU concept art. While Superman was the hero to start the DCEU, Aquaman will be the one to close out the franchise later this year with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. One of the things that was initially lined up for the December movie was a cameo by Affleck's Batman, but it is now not getting used at all, according to reports. However, it appears this part of the Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom story was repeating an attempt by the original Aquaman movie.\nIn new concept art revealed by Ed Natividad, who worked on Aquaman as a conceptual vehicle designer and is a concept artist for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Affleck's Batman was going to show up alongside the DCEU Justice League during the battle against Ocean Master. In an earlier draft of Aquaman, Ocean Master and the three kingdoms would have had a fight inside a city, which can be seen below:\nIn the early versions of the Aquaman 2018 script, Ocean Master commands the 3 Kingdoms to join him in the invasion of the surface world. He is met with resistance from the JL.\nRELATED: Aquaman & the Lost Kingdom Cast & DC Character Guide\nAs exciting as it would have been to have seen the Justice League in Aquaman, it was the wiser decision to cut them all out. For starters, this was Arthur Curry's first solo movie, after Warner Bros. had spent years trying to get this project to happen. Having other superheroes in Aquaman would have taken away some of his spotlight, which would have damaged the larger story between Arthur and Ocean Master.\nIt's also worth remembering that Aquaman came out after Justice League in 2017, with the team-up film becoming one of the most controversial movies for the DCEU timeline. Not only was it a box office disaster, but Justice League became a bigger nightmare in terms of the controversies surrounding Joss Whedon's reshoots when he took over for Zack Snyder. As such, having the Justice League in Aquaman so soon after the 2017 installment was likely a risk that Warner Bros. didn't want to take in the end.\nIt's ironic that after the attempt in Aquaman, DC tried to have another cameo by Affleck's Batman in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, only for it to get removed altogether. However, the circumstances are different in this case, as the Aquaman sequel is coming out right after The Flash, which has left the fate of Affleck's Batman up in the air, making a subsequent appearance in the DCEU only likely to confuse audiences. Hopefully, the creative struggles that Aquaman and other DCEU movies faced will not be carried over into James Gunn's DC Universe when it starts in 2024.\nSource: Ed Natividad\n"}
{"title": "Marvel's Fantastic Four: Release Date, Casting Rumors & Updates", "date": "2023-10-09 11:47:29", "text": "The MCU is bringing a new version of the Fantastic Four as part of its Multiverse Saga, and here's what you need to know about this reboot.\nThe Fantastic Four are finally joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of the Multiverse Saga, and here’s everything there is to know about this reboot. The more the MCU expands, the more opportunities emerge to bring more Marvel Comics characters to life, as well as to give a new chance to characters whose previous adaptations weren’t exactly a success. The Disney/Fox merge now gives Marvel the chance to use popular characters from Fox’s Marvel movies to make them part of the MCU multiverse, and among them are the Fantastic Four.\nThe Fantastic Four got their first film adaptation in 1994, in a project that has become infamous as it was never released, and their proper big-screen debut didn’t happen until 2005. Directed by Tim Story, Fantastic Four told the team’s origin story and got a sequel two years later, titled Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. The team got the reboot treatment in 2015 in a movie simply titled Fantastic Four and directed by Josh Trank. Unfortunately, Fantastic Four was a massive critical and commercial failure, but the team is getting one more chance, now as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and here’s what’s known so far about the MCU Fantastic Four reboot.\nRelated: 10 Lessons The MCU Fantastic Four Can Learn From The 2015 Movie 8 Years On\nOn October 6, 2023, Fantastic Four director Matt Shakman provided some information about the movie and its place in the MCU in an interview with Collider. Shakman revealed that shooting is still expected to begin in 2024 - most likely in the spring - and discussed the movie's base of operations, Pinewood Studios, where a selection of major series have been created, both within and outside the superhero genre.\nAccording to the director, the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes have not led the project to a standstill, as work is instead being done with effects and production design, allowing the world of Fantastic Four to be built while other aspects are not possible to be taken further forward. Most exciting, the director also described the project as \"unlike anything you've seen before, and certainly unlike anything at Marvel that you've seen before.\"\nThe Fantastic Four were confirmed to arrive at the MCU in 2019, during Marvel’s panel at San Diego Comic-Con. In December 2020, Jon Watts was announced as director, though in April 2022, he stepped down to take a break from directing superhero films after helming the MCU’s Spider-Man trilogy. During the 2022 D23 event, Matt Shakman was confirmed as the new director of Fantastic Four, and at the time of writing, the project is scheduled for a May 2, 2025 release, meaning the Fantastic Four will join the MCU during the final chapter of the Multiverse Saga.\nMost of the MCU’s Phase 5 and what has been revealed of Phase 6 so far have gone through various changes due to production delays, narrative restructures, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. What hasn’t changed, however, is Fantastic Four kicking off the MCU’s Phase 6, which might seem like a late introduction for such a big and popular team, but it makes sense within the MCU’s narrative. Fantastic Four will skip the team’s origin story and will introduce them as an active team, and they are believed to be set up as a big multiverse presence for either Avengers: The Kang Dynasty or Avengers: Secret Wars, so it makes sense that their movie is the one that marks the beginning of the end of the Multiverse Saga.\nMarvel is taking its time to find its Fantastic Four actors - especially in light of the current strikes - even though it already introduced one Reed Richards variant in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, played by John Krasinski. Although Scarlet Witch killed this variant, Krasinski’s casting was a major fan service moment that is widely expected to be repeated, but Krasinski has already revealed he had no discussions with Marvel about playing Reed Richards again - though, of course, this could be something that changes down the line.\nVarious rumors have emerged about who will be cast in the MCU’s Fantastic Four, with some of them quickly debunked, such as Jack Quaid being cast as Johnny Storm/Human Torch. At the time of writing, the biggest casting rumors surrounding the MCU’s Fantastic Four reboot are Matt Smith and Adam Driver for Reed Richards, Margot Robbie and Vanessa Kirby for Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn for Johnny Storm, and Daveed Diggs for Ben Grimm.\nHowever, all of these are just rumors shared by “insiders” and leakers without solid sources and information to back them up, though some of these actors have done their best to neither confirm nor deny meeting with Marvel. With Fantastic Four planned to start filming in London in 2024, the Fantastic Four director revealed that although he could not disclose much due to the strikes, \"once that's resolved, there'll be a plan at that point, but I can't say too much. There will be an announcement at some point! I know that the internet is very excited to find out, and I'm excited to share it. I just can't do it yet.\"\nMarvel is well-known for keeping details about its movies a secret until the very last minute, and in the case of its Fantastic Four reboot, it seems to be especially careful with casting and plot details. As mentioned above, it has been confirmed by Kevin Feige himself that the MCU’s Fantastic Four won’t be an origin story, but that’s all that’s known about the plot so far. Fantastic Four’s villain hasn’t been revealed either, so predicting the film’s story is a lot trickier than it seems. However, Fantastic Four is believed to be key in setting up the Multiverse Saga’s crossover events The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, so the movie could involve a Kang variant, with some theories pointing at Rama-Tut being the villain to defeat.\nOf course, many rumors and theories point at Fantastic Four introducing the MCU’s version of Doctor Doom, more so as this villain has a key role in the Secret Wars comic book storyline. Plot details about Fantastic Four surely won’t be revealed until the movie’s release date is close, and even then, many details will remain a secret as there surely will be some twists and turns that are best kept under wraps until the movie is released.\n"}
{"title": "The Best Swords In Assassin’s Creed Mirage (Ranked)", "date": "2023-10-09 11:31:26", "text": "The best swords in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage will keep Basim prepared for any situation or trouble he might unexpectedly find himself in.\nThere are ten swords in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, all of them with slightly different abilities. Basim will not be using his weapons quite as much as Bayek or Kassandra, but he will still occasionally have need of them. It is important to find a sword that will be useful in every situation as when combat does happen it is quite often a surprise to everyone.\nThere are both swords and daggers available to Basim, and he uses a combination of them to parry and attack enemies. Combined with the outfits in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, they will determine how Basim fights when forced into open combat. Here are the best swords in the game, ranked from worst to best including the swords available for purchase in the Animus Store.\nThe rankings are based on the stealth gameplay mechanics Assasin's Creed: Mirage favors, as this game encourages Basim to stay in the shadows and only fight openly when necessary. As this is not often, the rankings reflect that he will not often find himself fighting large numbers of enemies for an extended amount of time.\nRelated: Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Best Armor Is A Huge Disappointment\nThis sword's ability, On the Edge, states that “When Basim’s health is lower than 50%, light attacks deal 30% damage.” While this is a decent ability when relevant, Basim isn’t often in open combat in this game, as this game favors stealth mechanics over open combat.\nWhen he is in open combat, he is not often at low health enough for this to make a difference and there are better abilities for dealing with low health in general.\nThe Hidden One Sword can be found in a Gear Chest in the Wilderness, and the Venomous ability poisons an enemy on every 5th hit, which is a decent ability, but often the enemies fall within 2–3 hits. The synergy is not as good as it could be, and Basim is not fighting many enemies at once very often unless something has gone quite wrong. Even then, it is usually easier to fall back and find a way to surprise the enemies again with stealth, rather than continuing to fight.\nThe first of the weapons players must pay for on the list, the Jinn Sword may not be worth the price. The Weakness ability only affects enemies with afflictions when they are hit, dealing an extra 50% damage to them. Applying an affliction without directly killing the enemy, unless it was with a Tool, does not happen often, while there are other blades that can deal an extra 50% damage more often.\nThe Demon Claw must also be paid for in the Animus store, and its ability, Burning Blade, can apply fire to attacked enemies and, if they are already burning, attacking them will set their weapons on fire for 10 seconds. This edges out the Jinn Sword in that it can apply a status to the enemy, and it is best paired with the Dagger that comes with it in the store. And setting enemies on fire at least looks cool, even if it is not relevant all the time.\nRelated: Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Where You Know Roshan’s Voice From\nThe Lightning Sword comes with the Thunderstruck ability that deals 50 Lightning Damage to four nearby enemies every third attack. The added bonus of this ability is that it is not necessarily to the enemy Basim hit, so it can be used to whittle down the number of guards nearby.\nThat being said, if Basim finds himself surrounded by more than four active enemies, it is likely past time to disengage and regain stealth and decrease your Notoriety.\nStrike Back states that, “After a Perfect dodge, the next attack deals 50% damage.” This is much more relevant more often, as enemies often have moves that cannot be parried and Basim will have to dodge at the right time to attack the enemy successfully anyway. This sword and the next sword on the list feel about the same in practice, but this ability cannot be triggered quite as often.\nThe first blade Basim will receive is also a very useful one, as the Sharpened Blade Ability gives the next attack 50% damage after a successful parry. This can be relevant with every hit, and often enemies are killed by this damage. This is a very reliable weapon, and it is one of the best sources of that extra 50% damage. It edges out the Zanj Uprising Sword due to the fact that it triggers after any successful parry, while the previous one has to be a Perfect Dodge to trigger.\nThis is purchased with the Deluxe Edition of Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, Healing Sand Ability being the best out of the pay-to-play blades, although not quite as good as its Dagger counterpart. This ability states that “Killing an enemy while time has slowed down regenerates 30% health.”\nThis makes it good for dangerous situations as it can regenerate Basim’s health, and it can be triggered more often. While Basim should not find himself in low health often, often open combat is the result of a failed assassination or pickpocketing attempt, meaning that he could well need the extra health.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Mirage: How To Find & Use Mysterious Shards (Nehal's Calling Quest)\nThis sword is found by completing the “Weapons Dealer” contract in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, and the Chain Reaction ability makes it so that, “Every consecutive attack deals 5% damage, up to a maximum of 50%.” This can stack quite nicely, and it starts rewarding the player for hits right away, instead of requiring another factor to trigger. It is also relatively easy to acquire, and there is no real-world money that has to be spent to acquire it.\nThis is unlocked by collecting enough Mysterious Shards to unlock it in the Chamber in the Calling Quest. The Blood Price ability lowers Basim’s Maximum Health while wielding the blade but increases his damage with every hit by 50%. As combat is triggered less often overall, the lower health should not be too detrimental for Basim, and it pairs exceptionally well with The Samsaama Dagger also found in the Chamber, which can heal Basim. Basim can then take out enemies much faster and heal himself if necessary along the way, making this the best Sword in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}

In the chaos of the Wheel of Time season 2 finale, amid the questions of who lived and who died, in addition to lingering questions about season 3, it might have been easy to overlook the moment when Elayne (Ceara Coveney) saves Rand (Josha Stradowski) by healing his wound. It's a small but significant development that's tucked away in a very busy finale.\nBut while discussing Wheel of Time's season 2 finale in an interview with Collider, Judkins didn't hesitate to highlight the importance of the Elayne and Rand interaction when asked. Judkins makes reference to The Little Mermaid, naming Rand as \"Prince Eric.\" The showrunner also stresses that the relationship is one that's worth paying attention to, specifying the way the scene plays out for those that may not be familiar with the books. The full quote is below:\nIt’s a very brief moment, but Rand and Elayne, I call it The Little Mermaid moment. He’s bleeding out, clearly, dying…\nJUDKINS: He’s Prince Eric.\nAnd then there’s this beautiful face. It feels like sowing the seeds of that relationship and what it’s going to come to mean. How important was it for you to get that ball rolling in terms of connecting Rand to this person who he hasn’t even met until now?\nJUDKINS: We really wanted to flag for the audience that this is a relationship to pay attention to. So having her heal him of this wound that can’t be healed is a way to cement right away for the audience, “These two have a connection to each other, and I’m paying attention to what’s going on with the two of them.” The way he sees her, the way that she comes into the scene, it all hopefully is signaling to an audience that’s not familiar with the books that there’s something to really pay attention to there — because there is.\nThe Wheel of Time is already confirmed at Prime Video, delivering a strong performance on Nielsen's streaming charts that suggests the adaptation could stick around for a few more seasons to come. Given that sort of assurance, the show is making the choice not to rush one of the storylines that book readers are very familiar with.\nIn the Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson books, Rand and Elayne have several big moments that could provide the streaming hit with a lot of ammunition. But building the pairing more gradually, through glances and camera movements, and a relatively more muted scene in a hectic finale, means the show is choosing to let their story unfold at a pace that may make the milestone moments all the more rewarding.\n The scene could well be a teaser of what's ahead in The Wheel of Time season 3 and beyond. Rand looks at Elayne, and the way he looks at her, the way the shot lingers, points to an importance that will pay off later. Thankfully, with the show already renewed, and its future looking fairly secure, the couple has now officially taken a fleeting but immense first step.\nSource: Collider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

{"title": "Daryl Dixon's Big Walking Dead Cameo Sets Up A New Story, Teases Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-09 11:01:31", "text": "Daryl Dixon showrunner David Zabel comments on episode 5’s unexpected The Walking Dead cameo, and teases how this launches a new story.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 features an unexpected cameo, and showrunner David Zabel teases how it sets up future narratives. As Norman Reedus' iconic role as Daryl Dixon continues his adventures in France, he gets an unexpected call from back home. While the message was distorted by static, it is clear that it is Melissa McBride's voice as Carol, and she is informing her longtime friend and ally that someone \"came back.\"\nHearing Carol's voice is a big treat for The Walking Dead fans, who have followed her and Daryl's story in the mothership series. McBride was actually supposed to be a co-headliner in the spinoff, and hearing her voice in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 somehow makes up for that missed opportunity. Aside from her cameo, however, her garbled message is also a big topic of conversation among fans, and according to Zabel in an interview with EW, it launches a new story in the expanding universe, saying:\nWell, it is important to what her ongoing story may be, and it is important in terms of what we were thinking is going on in Carol's world at that moment. It's also not what the audience expects or anticipates, if they're anticipating something. So it will ultimately prove to be surprising. But that's all based on the idea that we're going to play out that story.\nPreviously billed as a limited series, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2 was ordered before the show even premiered. This means that Daryl's arc across the pond will likely not be resolved in the looming finale. With Daryl situated away from Alexandria, Carol's message is expected to set up another of The Walking Dead spinoffs, and it is best poised as the launching pad for the much-anticipated The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live.\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 didn't really share any other clue as to who Carol may be referring to, leaving Daryl and viewers wondering. However, considering Rick and Michonne's impending return to the universe, it seems like the perfect opportunity to tease what comes next after the Reedus-led show wraps up its freshman year. Either of them is a great candidate for the tease, and they also fit Zabel's tease about launching a brand-new storyline.\nRick and Michonne aren't the only candidates for the mysterious person that Carol is talking about. Morgan Jones coming back to Alexandria opens up an intriguing narrative since it ties Fear the Walking Dead to what's happening back in Alexandria. Otherwise, it could also be Dwight — Daryl's arch-nemesis and former member of The Saviors. Considering his ties to The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon's hero, it makes sense that Carol thinks that his comeback is noteworthy to Daryl.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "Magnum P.I. Season 5 Won't End With A Cliffhanger Following Cancellation, Promises Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:49", "text": "Magnum P.I. season 5 won’t end on a cliffhanger, as showrunner Eric Guggenheim promises it works as a series finale, but with a few caveats.\nMagnum P.I. showrunner Eric Guggenheim promises that season 5 won't end with a cliffhanger, revealing that it works as a series finale. The popular reboot of the Tom Selleck action series, which Jay Hernandez and Perdita Weeks lead, recently returned to NBC with its last ten episodes. The previews for Magnum P.I. season 5 part 2 hinted at a major announcement for Thomas Magnum (Hernandez) and Juliet Higgins (Weeks), but the show won't end unresolved.\nIn comments to TVLine, Guggenheim addresses the end of Magnum P.I. The showrunner dismisses the possibility of making edits or bringing back familiar faces, once the SAG-AFTRA strike ends. Guggenheim makes clear that it's not the ending for the reboot that he would've wanted. But he stresses that the last episode \"absolutely works\" as a series finale without the need to make changes. Guggenheim's quote is below:\n“I actually think it’s quite satisfying. I’m really proud of the finale.“There are a couple of threads left dangling that would have been picked up in a Season 6, but I didn’t want to end on a cliffhanger. If I’m being honest, I guess I wanted to play it safe. Too many shows have gotten burned with cliffhangers.”\n“Is it how I would choose to end the show? No. But if it has to be the last episode, I think it absolutely works as a [series] finale. So no, there’s no reason to go back and recut or reshoot.”\nMagnum P.I.'s cancellation was determined because the deals for the cast expired on June 30. NBC's Universal TV, which produces the reboot alongside CBS Studios, had to decide whether to extend those deals or end the series altogether. Of the three options available to the network - which were renewing season 6; extending the deals; or ending the reboot - NBC decided to cancel the show, given that the writers strike (and actors strike that followed) made it unclear when production could resume. Of course, since then, the writers strike has ended, and the actors remain in negotiations for a fair contract.\nMagnum P.I. season 5 has delivered well for NBC, though it represented a decline from its CBS numbers. Taking into account the show's delayed, non-live viewing, the reboot averages about 5 million viewers. That represents a 30 percent decline in total viewership from its time on CBS and a 43 percent slide in the coveted 18-49 age demographic. It should also be noted, however, that Magnum P.I. season 5 part 1 aired on Sundays after reruns which could have affected its performance.\nRelated: Magnum P.I. Reboot's 10 Biggest Changes To Tom Selleck's Original Series\nThe end of Magnum P.I. could also be traced back to the coming contraction in original, scripted programming. 2022 reached a high of 599 scripted originals, which does not take into account animated shows. It also leaves aside non-US series. It's expected that number will decline to around half in the coming years, as studios and streamers develop fewer programs. In that context, at the very least, it's good that the reboot won't be leaving its audience with unresolved questions.\nSource: TVLine\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

{"title": "8 Best Motivity Weapons In Lies of P", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:28", "text": "Motivity weapons are tied to Pinocchio's strength in Lies of P, with the best ones offering some mobility or some of the highest damage in the game.\nMotivity is essentially your strength stat in Lies of P, which scales to certain weapons that can deal some of the best damage in the game as Pinocchio levels up. While many tools of this type are heavy, slow items that take a long time to swing at enemies, there are some that make up for this risk. Fable Arts and different traits can make or break certain Motivity weapons you discover throughout your journey in Krat.\nWhile you could compare Motivity weapons by the Physical Attack value of the tool's blade and handle combinations, you have to consider other factors like Weight, Abilities, and Durability. The most OP Motivity builds in Lies of P rely on weapons that have a balanced spread of every attribute. For example, a weapon with low Durability has to be repaired multiple times in combat, so the high damage may not be worth the extra effort.\nSome of the best weapons in Lies of P cannot be used until you level up Pinocchio using Ergo from fallen enemies. Some tools are also created from Rare Ergo given by bosses, which can only be crafted with the treasure hunter Alidoro.\nOne of the earliest weapons for Motivity you can find in Lies of P is the Krat Police Baton, which can be a tool that Pinocchio uses for surprisingly quick attacks. The Blade on the Baton lets you gather your Strength together for a big forward slashing attack. Upgrading this weapon lets you deal a ton of damage to early-game enemies, taking most of them down in one to two hits with this charged strike.\nRelated: 10 Best Upgrades To Get First In Lies of P\nMeanwhile, the Handle may be the best part of this weapon, giving you increased damage temporarily on your next attack to make up for this tool's lack of Fable Arts. The customization of different weapon Blades and Handles makes this Baton part extremely useful. You have the ability to buff the damage value of almost any other tool whose Blade you'd prefer to use as you reach new areas in Lies of P.\nThe Greatsword of Fate is given to Pinocchio if you choose the Path of the Sweeper: Strength Combat Memory at the beginning of the game. This weapon doesn't need to be replaced for a long time, since its Handle ability named Absolute Defense can be good at any stage of Lies of P. Using this trait allows you to automatically Perfect Block an incoming attack instead of finding the right timing manually.\nAs a result, the Greatsword of Fate is the perfect weapon for those learning how to use a Motivity build's slower attacks and guarding. While this tool also does not have Fable Arts, there's no denying the sword's utility against early enemies such as the Parade Master or the Scrapped Watchman boss in Lies of P.\nThe first boss weapon here is the Holy Sword of the Ark, crafted through the King's Flame Fuoco boss in Lies in P. This tool has two Fable Arts like most special equipment, named Patient Smash and Alter. The Patient Smash ability lets you gather your strength into one strong hit while Alter transforms the blade into a longer weapon that consumes less Stamina.\nThis weapon is simple yet highly effective in Lies of P, giving you an alternate attack from Patient Smash when transformed from the Alter Fable Art. This gives you the chance to adjust to multiple types of enemies, similar to the switch mechanics seen in titles like Bloodborne.\nThe Noblesse Oblige is a Large Blunt weapon with Fable Arts that let you have offensive and defensive advantages in equal measure. The Ergo Release ability consumes Ergo in exchange for more damage, while Endure lets you temporarily withstand enemy strikes. These traits let this weapon have some of the highest, albeit Ergo expensive, damage in Lies of P that enemies can't stagger you out of while the other Fable Art is active.\nThe Frozen Feast weapon deals with a Motivity tool's greatest weakness with the Liberate Fable Art, which increases your attack speed as you instantly release the sword in Lies of P. This effect can stack up to four times, giving you far more swings to hit enemies than you usually would. The Single Slash Fable Art lets you gather your strength for a devastating forward slash attack as well, targeting enemies that might be outside your reach.\nThose looking for an elemental Motivity weapon should look no further than the Coil Mjolnir Hammer, which comes equipped with the Absolute Defense Fable Art like the Greatsword of Fate. This gives you some defensive ability when wielding this cumbersome tool, but this weapon's true benefit comes from the Thunderstrike Fable Art. This trait in Lies of P lets you strike downward in a massive Area of Effect (AoE) attack that electrocutes many enemies at once.\nThe Thunderstrike ability of the Coil Mjolnir Hammer also imbues the weapon with Electric Blitz, giving all your basic attacks a boost of electricity for a short duration of time.\nThe Big Pipe Wrench represents the ideal Motivity weapon, dealing the highest damage from almost any tool Pinocchio could wield in Lies of P. The Blade Fable Art is Patient Smash, which you can hold down the button for during your attack to deal unrivaled destruction to your enemies. The Payback Swing is the Wrench's other Art from the Handle that gives you a strong forward slash that has more power after guarding an enemy's strike.\nWhile it may not seem like the Bone-Cutting Saw has the best damage or even the best speed, it is perfect for Motivity builds in Lies of P for covering an unexpected limitation of Strength-based weapons. The Saw has the longest reach of any Motivity tool, which typically require you to get incredibly close to an enemy before attacking. This long blade gives you the opportunity to instead strike as enemies are approaching you, rather than the other way around.\nThe Fable Arts on the Bone-Cutting Saw are excellent two, with the Endure trait letting you absorb hits from enemies temporarily. That Handle ability pairs well with the Link Chop Blade Fable Art, which gives you a strong downward swing that gains more power for the more bars of Fable you spend. The extended range of this weapon for this attack makes it the best for Motivity in Lies of P, capable of hitting many targets in a single strike.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Finesse Weapons In Baldur's Gate 3", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:28", "text": "Baldur's Gate 3 has plenty of weapons to suit any character, but for players looking for finesse weapons, here are some of the very best. \nThere are a variety of weapon options in Baldur's Gate 3, all offering different damage types to suit different play styles. One of the more versatile is the finesse weapon; these melee weapons use Dexterity as the primary stat rather than Strength, often allowing them to be dual-wielded. These weapons are perfect for rogues, rangers, and bards as well as classes who don't traditionally use a weapon such as spellcasters.\n[Warning: The following article contains minor spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nIt is important to check if a character is proficient in using finesse weapons before giving them one in BG3. Characters can use weapons and armor they are not proficient in but will not be able to use them as effectively. Proficiencies can be checked on the character sheet tab for all Baldur's Gate 3 companions, and there will be a list of all the weapons and armor that the character is proficient in. As finesse weapons use Dexterity rather than Strength, it also makes sense to check that it is the higher of the two scores.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nThe Dancing Breeze is a very rare glaive which can be bought from Exxvikyap in Rivington General. This two-handed weapon deals 120+2 slashing damage and gives any character using it extra reach, which is great for using its Whirlwind Attack. With Whirlwind Attack, once per short rest, the character can spin themselves and the glaive around, striking all nearby enemies.\nA great Act One finesse weapon is the Githyanki Shortsword, which can be found either after battling the githyanki patrol or on a githyanki corpse in the Mountain Pass. The shortsword does 1d6 piercing damage with a chance to deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage if the target has less than 50% of their hit points. Wielding two of these not only looks very cool but can also quickly finish off wounded opponents.\nStillmaker is a very rare dagger found in a cave during the quest \"Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders\" at the beginning of Act Three, with this Baldur's Gate 3 loot well hidden in a hole. While it doesn't do a massive amount of damage, 1d4+7 piercing, it comes with the spell hold person. Hold person is a fantastic crowd control spell, but when used by a rogue, it will guarantee sneak attack damage as well as make all other attack critical hits.\nSpeedy Reply is an awesome early-game scimitar that can be found on a dead caravan agent on the Risen Road, directly north of the Blighted Village. It deals a decent 1d6 slashing damage and has the feature Nimble Attack. Nimble Attack will give the wielder momentum for two turns when they hit an enemy with Speedy Reply. Momentum increases that character's speed, making it easier for them to move around the battlefield.\nThe Adamantine Scimitar is one of three weapons that can be created at the Adamantine Forge in Grymforge and is the only finesse option. This rare blade does 1d6+1 slashing damage and ignores resistances against slashing damage. But the best feature of the Adamantine Scimitar is Diamondsbane, which means that any hit with this weapon is an automatic crit.\nDown in the Underdark, close to the Selune Temple, there is a blade embedded in the rock; this is the rare longsword Phalar Aluve. A character will need to pass either a Strength or Religion check to get the sword from the stone, but if they pass, the party will have a great finesse weapon. Phalar Aluve does 1d10+5 slashing damage, but its best feature is the Singing Sword ability.\nOnce per short rest, the wielder can choose to either buff their allies with Sing or debuff enemies with Shriek. Sing gives all allies within 6 meters +1d4 on attack rolls and saving throws that use Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence. Shriek debuffs all enemies in the same radius with -1d4 to their saves and deals out 1-4 thunder damage to them as well.\nThe Duellist's Prerogative is a legendary rapier found in Act Three by completing the quest \"Save Vanra.\" The rapier does 1d8 piercing and 1d4 necrotic damage, and if used solo with nothing in the character's off-hand, will allow the wielder to crit on a 19 as well as gain an additional reaction per turn. This comes in hand with the blade's other feature, which allows the wielder to deal additional necrotic damage on a hit by using their reaction.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: 10 Hardest Secrets & Hidden Things To Find In Act 3\nThe Duellist's Prerogative also has two more features: Challenge to Duel and Dueller's Enthusiasm. Challenge to Duel is a spell the wielder can gain, which does exactly as it sounds, challenging an enemy to attack only the caster and inflicting bleeding on them. Dueller's Enthusiasm is the rapier's special action, letting the wielder use their bonus action to make an additional melee attack if they are not dual-wielding.\nThe Sussur Dagger is one of three weapons that can be forged when completing the quest \"Finish the Masterwork Weapon\" in Act One. The dagger gives +1 to attack and damage rolls as well as dealing 1d4 piercing damage. However, what makes the Sussur Dagger special is that it will Silence enemies on a hit, making it especially effective against enemy spellcasters.\nCrimson Mischief is one of two excellent finesse weapons obtained by defeating Orin near the end of Baldur’s Gate 3. Crimson Mischief is a legendary shortsword that deals 1d6+2 piercing and 1d4 necrotic damage but can inflict more damage on targets if they have fewer than 50% of their total hit points left. When used in the wielder's main hand, Crimson Mischief deals an extra seven points of piercing damage on attacks made with advantage. However, when used as an off-hand weapon, the shortsword allows the wielder to add their ability modifier to the damage, making it fantastic in the hands of a rogue.\nBloodthirst is the companion weapon to Crimson Mischief and also provides different benefits depending on whether it is the main hand or off-hand weapon. Bloodthirst also comes with Improved Critical, which reduces the number needed for a critical hit by one, and best of all, this effect can stack. This legendary dagger comes with the cantrip true strike and will inflict vulnerability onto enemies on a hit, doubling all piercing damage done to them. If Bloodthirst is used as an off-hand weapon, it casts true strike onto enemies who miss with their attacks, giving the wielder an advantage on their next attack roll against that enemy in Baldur’s Gate 3.\n"}

Before he joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of Loki season 2's cast, Quan had an important part to play in a past Marvel movie. The actor now stars as the vibrant O.B. opposite Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Owen Wilson's Mobius M. Mobius in the Disney+ series, but his previous Marvel role was very different.\nOn Twitter, an old video from the set of 2000's X-Men shared by @MarveIFacts showcases the Loki star's role as a stunt choreographer for the Marvel film.\nIn the video, Quan can be seen with Hugh Jackman's stunt double, teaching the Wolverine actor the choreography of one of his scenes as the Marvel mutant for the film. So far, Loki season 2's story has not demanded Quan to put his stunt expertise to use, but the season has only begun.\nQuan's role in Loki season 2, as part of one of the MCU's best TV shows, is the perfect pay-off to his career. While the actor has only appeared as O.B. in one episode of the series so far, he brought along with him the energy that has become expected from Quan with every role. More than that, Quan's Loki season 2 role interestingly harkens back to the actor's career in a key way.\nQuan's Loki season 2 role is the perfect mix of his two best characters. The MCU series deals with a sprawling multiverse story, setting up many important elements for Marvel Studios' wider Multiverse Saga. Quan's role as O.B. in Loki season 2 connects with the movie that led to his Best Actor Oscar win, Everything Everywhere All At Once. The movie also told a multiversal story, with Quan playing several different versions of the same character across the film's expansive and heartfelt plot.\nAdding to that, O.B. is the head of the Time Variance Authority's \"Repairs and Advancement\" department, serving as the inventor of all the technology at the TVA. That connects to one of Quan's most famous roles, as Data from The Goonies was also a prolific inventor despite only being a kid. As an inventor responsible for the technology of the organization that keeps the multiverse in line in the MCU, Quan's Loki season 2 role serves as the perfect payoff to his career.\nSource: @MarveIFacts/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "Detective Pikachu Returns: All Quiz Professor Locations (& Answers)", "date": "2023-10-09 10:15:28", "text": "The Quiz Professor can be found throughout four chapters of Detective Pikachu Returns and each time she will have 3 questions to solve.\nIn Detective Pikachu Returns, there are several local tasks to complete while working through the main storyline cases; one of these additional tasks comes from the Quiz Professor. The Quiz Professor will be found in several locations throughout the game, each time with a new question to solve.\nThe Quiz Professor will be looking for an answer pertaining to a specific Pokémon in the surrounding area. However, there won't be any multiple-choice selections to choose from. Instead, players will need to track down the Pokémon they believe is the answer and speak with it before reporting back to the Quiz Professor.\nRelated: \"A Fine Game That Knows Its Niche\": Detective Pikachu Returns Review\nDuring the first case, The Missing Jewel, the Quiz Professor will be encountered for the first time in Serenity Park. She can be found below the entrance to the terrace, near a set of stairs. She can be easily spotted on the path standing next to a Toucannon. The Quiz Professor will have three questions, but each one must be answered before she will tell you the next.\nInteracting with a Pokémon before receiving the question will not register the answer, so you will need to interact with the correct Pokémon again, even if you already have, after receiving the question.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What Pokémon catches prey using its looong tongue?\nLickitung\nThe Lickitung needed to solve this question can be found further down to the left of where the Quiz Professor is. The Lickitung will be found next to a young boy and is rather large, so it shouldn't be too hard to spot. Speak with this Pokémon to solve the first question.\n2. What Pokémon uses its cute looks to put you off your guard, so it can steal from you?\nPurrloin\nFor Purrloin, head over to the fountain found in the park, and there will be an elderly gentleman sitting on a bench. Purrloin should be hanging around him. Interact with this Pokémon to solve the second question.\n3. Best Buds always stick together - what Pokémon moves as a group?\nFalinks\nThe group of Falinks will be found behind the Quiz Professor, under the terrace. There will be several of them all together, as expected, so they should be easy enough to track down.\nDuring the second case, The Fabled Aura, the Quiz Professor will be found a second time in the Southern Ruins area, one of the many beautiful settings in Detective Pikachu Returns; head up the hill to where Ursaring is hanging out and turn right. The Quiz Professor can be found once again hanging out with her Toucannon. She will have three new questions that will be completed the same way. Look for the Pokémon she describes in her question, which should be in the surrounding area, and then report to the professor for the next question.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What winged Pokémon has a round body and adorable eyes?\nRowlett\nFor this Pokémon, head back to the entrance of the Southern Ruins to find Rowlett perched on top of a couple of rocks.\n2. What Pokémon has a blocky body, impressive jaws and will shock you if you touch it?\nCharjabug\nCharjabug can be a little difficult to spot due to its coloring, but luckily it's on the ground directly in front of where Rowlett is from the first question. However, keep in mind you will need to receive the second question before interacting with Charjabug will count, so you won't be able to get Rowlett and Charjabug in one go.\n3. What Pokémon is soft and fluffy all over?\nEldegoss\nAt the top of the hill, Eldegoss can be found near the door to the ruins. Interacting with Eldegoss will complete the last quiz question for this specific Quiz Professor.\nIn the story's third chapter, Detainee Pikachu, the Quiz Professor, will be found near an alley on 2nd Avenue. As usual, her Toucannon should be easy enough to spot, and just like the two previous times, she will have three questions pertaining to Pokémon in the area, all of which Pikachu can speak to, but despite the voice acting featured in Detective Pikachu Returns, players will not be able to listen on these conversations as Pikachu will verbalize his side.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower blooming on its head?\nLilligant\nHead over to the main street, and Lilligant can be found perfectly blending in near the entrance of the flower shop on the corner.\n2. What Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to stay clean, and lives as it pleases?\nDelcatty\nLuckily, Delcatty can be found right near the flower shop where Lilligant was found. Delcatty is a little further off to the corner, but as said before, players will need to return to the Quiz Professor after interacting with Lilligant and then go look for Delcatty.\n3. What Pokémon can sense emotion via the protrusion on its head and prefers secluded spaces?\nHatenna\nIn order to find Hatenna, head back to the police station parking lot on 2nd Avenue and Hatenna can be found hanging out in one of the parking spaces.\nDuring the Bamboo Forest chapter, players will encounter the Quiz Professor for the last time, as she will not be present for the final chapter of Detective Pikachu Returns. The Quiz Professor and her Toucannon will be found near the entrance to the Bamboo Forest. She will have her final three questions prepared to reference new Pokémon in the area.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What Pokémon bites and eats anything it comes across?\nDeino\nDeino can be found back on the main street of the Bamboo Borough, in front of the pizza place.\n2. What sharp-eyed Pokémon keeps watching from above for anyone suspicious?\nNoctowl\nNoctowl will be found in the Bamboo Forest, off to the right, sitting on top of one of the direction signposts.\n3. What agile Pokémon have leaves growing on its arms and head?\nGrovyle\nGrovyle is further down in the Bamboo Forest. Head down the path to Charcoal Kiln to find Grovyle hanging out along the path.\nAfter the encounter in Memories of Bamboo Forest, players can proceed on to the final chapter of Detective Pikachu Returns, but the Quiz Professor will not make another appearance. There is no significant reward specifically for completing all the Quiz Professor's questions, but it is a fun additional task that allows players to see more Pokémon during their playthrough.\n"}
{"title": "Assassin’s Creed Mirage: How To Assassinate The Treasurer (Without Getting Caught)", "date": "2023-10-09 10:01:27", "text": "An elusive target known as The Treasurer can be hard to assassinate in Assassin's Creed Mirage without getting caught, unless you grab a certain item.\nDifferent targets to assassinate in Assassin's Creed Mirage are difficult to approach without getting caught, especially the well-defended Treasurer. The influence this figure wields lets them sit at the top of Karkh's web of power, where they tax poor merchants to fund the controlling Order. Their true identity has remained a secret as they approach the Bazaar marketplace in search of a rare Eastern hairpin to add to their collection of seized artifacts.\nThe \"Gilded Butterflies\" quest puts the main character Basim against the Treasurer, to not only find who they are but to also gather information about where they could be found. Go ahead and use your Eagle Sight to scout ahead and determine where most guards are located in restricted areas. Those who don't want to increase their notoriety in Assassin's Creed Mirage need to be careful as they explore defended areas like the Bazaar market.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nSimilar to assassinating Fazil the Great Scholar in Assassin's Creed Mirage, your first task here should be to gather intel about the events going on in the Bazzar. Basim can eavesdrop on different conversations by sitting on benches or blending into the background. However, if you go into the main market, you can find the merchant Kong, who agrees to tell you some info on the Treasurer in exchange for a favor.\nKong wants you to find a decorative plate that had been taken from him earlier before giving out any knowledge he may have on the Treasurer. Your quest marker will point you to a room with a shelf you can move to reach a higher floor of the Bazaar. Reach a space above the room to use a red pot to make part of the wall explode, letting you place the shelf in a place under the space where the plate is being kept.\nYou might be able to find other merchants who accept Khidmah Tokens in Assassin's Creed Mirage to gain some discounts on powerful items or clues from around the Bazaar to help you against the Treasurer.\nReturning to Kong reveals that he overheard two women who said that the Treasurer is likely someone from the East. Continue forward through the Bazaar until you hear a merchant selling foreign goods up a set of stairs to the right in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Talk to the merchant to reveal that the Treasurer is after a rare hairpin from China that is apparently up for grabs at a particular auction being held in the market.\nNot too far away from the merchant you just talked to, you'll see two women with a magnifying glass symbol above them on a higher floor of the market. Climb toward the fountain in the center of the Bazaar by using the ropes attached to it. This will lead you to the room with the mysterious travelers in Assassin's Creed Mirage, where you should sit on a nearby bench to eavesdrop on their continuing conversation about the Treasurer.\nOne of the two women here is a Perfume Supplier talking to someone named Qabiha before leaving to a more private location. Use Basim's trained stealth skills to follow them and learn more about the Treasurer's deals and projects in Assassin's Creed Mirage. After eavesdropping a bit longer, speak to Qabiha to learn that the Treasurer has a particular interest for a special perfume made with blood, and that they are actually a woman named Ning.\nFiguring out the Treasurer's identity from Qabiha gives you a face to look for in the crowds of the Great Auction, the large event you learned about earlier from the merchant selling goods from the East. Travel back through the first floor of the Bazzar to find a merchant who can take you to the Auction. This figure will be marked in orange by your Eagle Sight as you explore the crowd of merchants in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nTraveling to the Auction shows a row of benches with a Host on a large podium ready to get started, sit on any of the benches here to participate. A small cutscene will take place that gives you your first look at Ning, the Treasurer who you've been searching for throughout the mission in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Eventually, the hairpin will be brought up as an item that you can bid on using whatever Coins you have.\nYou can either try to outbid the Treasurer or do nothing at this point in Assassin's Creed Mirage, though the second option is likely better since you won't lose any money. If you don't pay for the hairpin, you need to steal it from the merchant who did buy it from the Auction. Simply climb up to the second level of the Auction area and move behind the man in black robes to swiftly take the hairpin while no one is looking.\nThe last step of this mission is tricky, since you need to have a special item called the Dragon Brooch to gain an audience with the Treasurer in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Head back to the entrance of the Bazaar and sneak past the soldiers guarding a Restricted Area. Go inside until you find a small room with the Brooch on a table protected by two guards, who you can silently kill by luring them to a changing closet.\nOnce you have the Brooch, follow your quest marker to reach another section of the market guarded by soldiers of the Ivory Coin. Ordinarily, these men wouldn't let you through without the Brooch, but now they will eagerly let you inside. Follow the escorting guard until you reach a large audience chamber with the Treasurer past her large assortment of artifacts she's obtained over the years.\nThe \"Interact\" prompt in the audience chamber gives you another quick cutscene where you can finally assassinate the Treasurer without having been caught in the crowded markets of Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n"}

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage: How to Solve the Tales of Baghdad Quests", "date": "2023-10-09 09:00:28", "text": "The Tales of Baghdad Quests in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage might need a little creativity to find, but they give Basim insight into Baghdad’s civilians.\nIn every region of Baghdad in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, there will be a collectible labeled on the map called “Tales of Baghdad.” These vaguely named collectibles can be hard to find, and there is no real solution given to Basim as he traverses the city and becomes a Hidden One. Therefore, players have to seek answers independently to figure out how to solve these puzzles.\nIn Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, players will be tasked with finding and solving many different types of puzzles, but the Tales of Baghdad quests are a special type of puzzle. They allow Basim to interact with the people of Baghdad by helping them with something they need, usually finding it for them. Each one is slightly different, but they all have the same basic problem-solving process.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nUsing Enkidu’s Eye or finding a close Synchronization Point is the best way to see each quest's location. There is one in each section of the Assassin’s Creed: Mirage's map, although they will not always pop up when players activate the first Synchronization Point in a given region. Generally, activating the closest Synchronization Point will do the trick; if not, Enkidu can find it while surveying an area. The icon will look like the golden flower symbol that the game uses as a save icon.\nThe Tales of Baghdad Quests all have rewards of either skill points or Dirham, the game's currency that can be used to purchase upgrades for weapons or outfits in Assassin's Creed: Mirage, making them worth the effort to help someone out.\nOnce the location has been found, Basim can travel there and activate the quest. There will not be a given or automatic quest activation for the Tales of Baghdad. Instead, look around for someone Basim can talk to, usually with a conversation icon above their head. They will be close to the quest marker but not necessarily right on top of it. Once Basim has spoken with them, they will tell him what they are looking for or need him to do, and he can then choose to do so.\nOnce the conversation is over, use Basim’s Eagle Sense to find your objective. These quest objects usually glow orange, and the Tales of Baghdad quests often require players to look for particular things, such as a gravestone or pages of a book. When you are done, if the quest does not automatically update, return to the quest giver and speak to them to finish it. Although they all require Basim to find slightly different things, it will be the same basic process to solve each Tales of Baghdad puzzle in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}
{"title": "All Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematic Locations in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage", "date": "2023-10-09 08:30:25", "text": "The Abbasid Knight set and Upgrade Schematics in Assassin's Creed Mirage are worth it, but tracking down every piece is a wild goose chase.\n\nLooking for the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics across Baghdad in Assassin's Creed Mirage is a perplexing challenge. However, it is completely worthwhile. When out of enemy sight, the Abbasid Knight Outfit slowly regenerates Basim's health, making it ideal for an assassin of his nature. The Abbasid Knight Sword and Dagger that come with the set are also worth picking up. However, the set isn't finished even if you have all the pieces. To properly complete the collection, you must find all the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics scattered throughout the map.\nTo acquire all the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics, you must find and open Gear Chests scattered throughout the Karkh and Abbasiyah regions. However, acquiring these upgrade schematics is unique because the gear drops based on the number of chests you open rather than opening a chest in a specific location. For example, regardless of which Gear Chest you find first in the Karkh region, as long as it's the first one you have seen, it will have the Abbasid Knight Outfit. In other words, the loot always drops in order of the item first, then Upgrade Schematics after.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nTo acquire every piece and Upgrade Schematic for the Abbasid Knight set in Assassin's Creed Mirage, you will have to open all the chests in Karkh and Abbasiyah. The Abbasid Knight Outfit, dagger, and the two Upgrade Schematics for both pieces are found in six Gear Chests in Karkh.\nThe Abbasid Knight Sword and Upgrade Schematics can be found in three of the six Gear Chests in Abbasiyah. However, because the pieces unlock by order, you'll need to open all the chests in Abbasiyah anyway, which is good because in addition to completing the Abbasid Knight set, you will also get the Zanji Uprising Dagger and the two upgrade schematics for it as well.\nThe Abbasid Knight Outfit heals Basim when undetected and below 50%, but the sword and dagger pair with it. The Abbasid Sword, for example, causes light attacks to deal 30% more damage when you are below 50% health. Conversely, the Dagger will grant you 30% damage resistance when you're below 50% health.\nMany of the Gear Chests you're searching for in Karkh and Abbasiyah are puzzling. Some will challenge you with enemies protecting it, while others will require you to solve a puzzle, such as using a fire pot to blow open an entry. In addition, some Gear Chests will even require you to obtain a key before you can open them.\nBecause the map size in Assassin's Creed Mirage is huge, locating each Gear Chest in Karkh is difficult to put into words. Thankfully, the Game Guides Channel on YouTube can pinpoint where to find each of the six Gear Chests in Karkh. It's also worth noting that the Gear Chests hidden inside buildings can be highlighted using Enkindu or Basim's Eagle Vision.\nOne of the Gear Chests in Karkh is locked behind a door that won't open until you complete the \"Gilded Butterflies\" Main Quest.\nAll three of the Abbasiyah chests that contain the Abbasid Knight Sword and Upgrade Schematics will require a key to unlock a door or the chest itself. In every instance, the key is far from the actual Gear Chest location. Thankfully, GamerPillar on YouTube outlines exactly where to find the Gear Chests and the keys needed to open them.\nOnce you have all of the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics, you will need the right materials to perform the upgrades. To upgrade the Abbasid Knight Outfit to tier two, it will cost 30 Steel Ingots and 60 Leather in addition to the Upgrade Schematic. Tier three requires the second Upgrade Schematic, 60 Steel Ingots, and 120 Leather.\nYou must also gather materials for and upgrade the Abbasid Knight Sword and dagger to tier three. Once you've upgraded the Abbasid Knight set to tier three, you will have the best armor in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nSource: GameGuidesChannel/YouTube, GamerPillar/YouTube.\nRiley is currently attending Mount Royal University for a degree in Journalism.

{"title": "Every Wordle Answer: All Words Used So Far (Updated Daily)", "date": "2023-10-09 06:05:25", "text": "Wordle is a simple daily word game that has taken the internet by storm. With only 6 chances to get the right answer, players may need a little help.\nWordle is a simple word-guessing game that tasks players with solving a five-word puzzle using letter position clues. Wordle presents the player with six rows of five empty boxes. Simply enter a random five-letter word and the website highlights certain letters in green if they are correct, yellow if they are correct but in the wrong spot, or grey if they are not in the word at all. With this information, players need to try to figure out the word within the six guesses to be successful.\nThese types of guessing games have been around for a long time. One of the originals was called Mastermind, where players are tasked with guessing a row of colored pegs that utilizes the same hint systems found in Wordle. If players would like to try the game for themselves, it can be found on the Wordle website, which creates a new puzzle every day, keeps track of players' win streaks and guess distribution, and has a popular sharing ability.\nComedian Patton Oswalt scored a Wordle win-in-two, even though he only got a single misplaced letter from his starting word. He shared his win from July 15th on Twitter and called it \"Lucky!\"\nWith a new Wordle added every day, players may need a little help with the more difficult words, and having a strong starting word is important. Players may not have time to work out the puzzle solution every day, or perhaps they just want to keep their streak going but are having too much difficulty with the daily word. Whatever the reason, players can find every daily Wordle answer used so far in 2023 below.\nLooking for last year's answers? They're all here below for archiving needs.\nSimple games, like Wordle, are the perfect small distraction for the day. The game itself doesn't take up too much time and is a nice break during the standard morning routine. Being able to compare with friends on social media sites makes Wordle even more addicting by adding the element of competition. With the win streak tracking feature and social media sharing button, Wordle is the perfect little puzzle to spend 3-5 minutes on during a workday.\n"}

Today's puzzle is very straightforward and shouldn't cause too much trouble for most players. The only thing that may frustrate some players is the lack of vowels in today's correct word.\nOne of the best strategies for solving Wordle is consistency. For instance, if you use the same starting word or combination of words each day you'll learn how to move forward with any hints that are given. This is a foolproof way to lower the amount of guesses you need to solve the daily puzzle.

Continuing on, our second attempt was FLUTE. This locked in a 'T' and put us on the path to victory with today's answer.\nGuess number three was SHUTS, this really provided almost everything we needed to figure out the answer since the misplaced 'H' only had a few places it could possibly go.

Elliot Page plays Courtney, a medical student whose obsession with the afterlife leads to her conducting a series of experiments that end up having unforeseen consequences for those who agree to take part.\nThe Silence of the Lambs is an award-winning movie, it was decorated in accolades upon its release in 1991. The psychological-horror is one of only 3 movies to have achieved the 'Big Five' at The Oscars picking up the Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture in one night. The movie was adapted by director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally who transformed the original novel written by Thomas Harris in 1988. The movie follows main protagonist Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young up-and-coming FBI agent who has been drafted in to track down the manic serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). Do achieve this, Clarice seeks out the help of psychiatrist, and convicted cannibalistic serial killer, Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), what better way to get in the mind of a twisted serial killer than to team up with one? Apart from the obvious questionable past times and dietary preferences of some protagonists, perhaps the most unsettling thing about The Silence of the Lambs is the close-ups. There are some real uncomfortable moments of dialogue where the male characters are staring directly down the lens whilst talking. This was an unnerving choice by Demme, and although quite a subtle and simple effect, we are able to share a lot of Clarice's discomfort. Perception is key in this film and Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is bleak and gritty with a perfectly accompanied score. If you are looking for a scary movie to make you unsettled, you won't go wrong with The Silence of the Lambs. Also, if you enjoy it, the prequel 'Hannibal' is also free to stream for Amazon Prime members. \nDune the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.\nThe 2022 incarnation of Scream is the fifth entry in the franchise, set twenty-five years after the brutal murders caused by Billy Loomis and Stu Macher shocked the quiet town of Woodsboro. Now a new killer has donned the Ghostface mask and has begun targeting a group of teenagers to resurrect secrets from the town's deadly past. Following the prior killers' footsteps, a new Ghostface attacks a high school student named Tara Carpenter. When her sister learns of the attack, she returns and meets with Tara's old friend group to check on her. However, Ghostface strikes again when they visit the hospital, forcing them to partner with series regulars Dewey Riley, Sidney Prescott, and Gale Weathers to discover the truth behind the original Woodsboro murders and stop the new copycats.\nBack To Top\n"}
{"title": "&quot;The Rise & Fall Of Jabba The Hutt&quot;: Guillermo del Toro Discusses Canceled Star Wars Movie", "date": "2023-10-09 03:59:23", "text": "Visionary director Guillermo del Toro has confirmed that he once worked on a Jabba the Hutt Star Wars movie in the early years of Disney's Lucasfilm.\nDirector Guillermo del Toro has confirmed his involvement in a Star Wars movie focused on the rise and fall of Jabba the Hutt. Although the development and cancelation of a Jabba movie has been known history for quite some time, it's only recently that Del Toro's involvement has been revealed. Now, the visionary director has confirmed that he did indeed work on a movie starring the galaxy's most infamous crime lord, providing some compelling insight into what the film could have looked like.\nThe news of a Jabba the Hutt movie was confirmed in 2017, though it wasn't long before it was canceled. With Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars IP only being a few years old at the time, many of their movie ideas never left the development stage. However, a Jabba the Hutt movie from Guillermo del Toro would have certainly been very dynamic and intriguing. Confirming his involvement, you can see Del Toro's interview with Collider below where he shares that his Star Wars movie would have been about \"The Rise and Fall of Jabba the Hutt\":\nAccording to Del Toro, it certainly seems as though he and his collaborators had a large amount of the movie planned out: “We designed a great world and great stuff. We learned. So, you can never be ungrateful with life. Whatever life sends you, there’s something to learn from it.\" While Del Toro seems to have made his peace with the movie's cancelation, it's possible scripts were written and concept art created before the movie was axed.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nBy all accounts, \"The Rise and Fall of Jabba the Hutt\" does sound fascinating. Having lived to be nearly 600 years old before his demise in Return of the Jedi, there would be so much ground to cover regarding the crime lord's rise to power through the ranks of the Hutt clans in the Outer Rim. To that end, it follows that the movie would perhaps end with the daimyo establishing his power base on Tatooine, the peak of his rise while also the beginning of his fall as seen in the original trilogy of Star Wars films.\nIf anyone could have made a successful Star Wars movie starring what's essentially a giant slug puppet, Guillermo del Toro was certainly the right call. Likewise, there's no doubt that Del Toro would have captured the true villainy of Jabba the Hutt, the merciless and renowned crime boss who held the entire Outer Rim in an iron grip for centuries, one who fed monsters in his basement those who displeased him with a booming laugh that would strike fear into the hearts of his victims. Seeing the origins of such a powerful Star Wars character would have been extremely exciting.\nSource: Collider\n"}
{"title": "Doctor Who's Classic Companion Reveals Why Ncuti Gatwa's Era Is Important", "date": "2023-10-09 02:42:48", "text": "Former Doctor Who star Sophie Aldred explains why incoming Doctor Ncuti Gatwa's casting is important to the show, citing a sweet personal story.\nSeventh Doctor companion actor Sophie Aldred explains why Ncuti Gatwa's upcoming Doctor Who era is significant. The Sex Education star will take the keys to the TARDIS in the show's 60th anniversary celebrations before going on to lead his first seasonal special during the holidays. Gatwa's first full season will be Doctor Who season 14, and it will air in 2024.\nSpeaking to RadioTimes ahead of Doctor Who's 60th anniversary, Aldred revealed that Gatwa's casting on the show has already left a profound impact on her. The Seventh Doctor era star explained that her own son expressed interest in watching the series following Gatwa's casting announcement, showing how the actor has already drawn in a new generation of fans. Check out Aldred's full answer below:\n\"He's gonna be such a brilliant Doctor. He's just got everything, he's just amazing. And also, when it was announced that he was going to be the new Doctor, my son, who's gay and a drag queen, came running downstairs and said, 'Mum, I'm going to start watching Doctor Who now,' because he's not watched it, he's not been that fussed.\n\"And I just think it's brilliant, all these amazing casting choices that Russell T Davies is making. So, I think we're just gonna have a whole new generation and a whole new fanbase for Doctor Who, which is very, very exciting. So, yeah, I'm thrilled to see how it's gonna go.\"\nWhile Gatwa's new era of Doctor Who is appealing to established viewers due to the returns of celebrated former creatives, it is undeniable that it is also opening the door for newcomers. With his award-winning role as Eric Effiong in Sex Education and his appearance in the summer box office hit Barbie, Gatwa is a rising star who has already created anticipation for his Fifteenth Doctor. Furthermore, Gatwa's casting marks a significant moment in Doctor Who history, as he becomes the first Black actor to lead the series.\nDoctor Who season 14 has also attracted attention for its potential handling of queer characters and topics. Davies' previous work both within Doctor Who and beyond have featured topics surrounding the LGBTQIA+ community, and Gatwa himself came out publicly as queer in an interview this year. It is also believed trans Heartstopper star Yasmin Finney will appear in season 14, reprising her role of Rose Temple-Noble from the show's 60th anniversary. With members of the LGBTQIA+ community at the forefront of Doctor Who both behind and in front of the camera, the show will hopefully feature a welcoming and inclusive world of adventures going forward.\nBetween eye-catching costumes, an all-star line-up of guest appearances, and a celebrated actor leading the show, the future of Doctor Who is incredibly bright and already receiving much attention. Aldred's son's reaction is one shared by many, who for the first time could see an accessible point to jump into the series. With viewers both new and old eager to jump into the Time Vortex alongside Gatwa's new Doctor, the actor's first adventure is sure to be one of 2023's most highly anticipated TV moments.\nSource: RadioTimes\n"}

Nikki is a 47-year-old recording artist known as Nikki Exotika from Hoboken, New Jersey. When she’s not performing, Nikki sheds her diva alter ego to become a homebody who works as a hairstylist, makeup artist, and beauty consultant. Nikki is a trans woman who’s done “every kind of plastic surgery” from head to toe. Nikki met Justin in the most unexpected way. 17 years ago, Nikki used to date a Russian man who was deported from the U.S. after committing a crime.\nReality TV show star Nikki’s ex-boyfriend got deported to Chişinău, Moldova, where Nikki flew to meet him. The man had a different girlfriend there. Nikki rebounded by finding Justin, who was then named “Igor” on a website in Moldova. She renamed “Igor” Justin because of his resemblance to Justin Timberlake. Justin proposed to Nikki on her fourth visit to Moldova. Justin’s K-1 visa was approved. He moved to the U.S. to get married to Nikki.\nTwo weeks after Justin came to the U.S. for the first time, the couple “had some issues” that couldn’t be resolved. Justin was being lazy. He never helped Nikki out with the housework. He expected Nikki to cook and clean for him apart from her working to make money for them. They had a lot of arguments, and during one such quarrel, Nikki told him, “Yeah, well, I have a secret to tell you, I used to be a man.” It had been two years since Justin and Nikki had begun dating.\nNikki was about 20 years old when she had her sex change operation. Nikki finally felt like the woman she wanted to be, she was “reborn again.” Nikki was living her life in “stealth.” It meant that she didn’t tell people she was born a man. She was still very closed off when discussing her sexuality. She never had any trans or gay friends. She wanted some time to find herself. Justin was “freaked” out when he found out the truth about Nikki from her own mouth. “He was in shock,” Nikki revealed.\nJustin fled from the U.S. back to Moldova, where he was depressed for a “really long time.” Nikki and Justin stayed in contact, but they started talking again two years ago when they were both single. Nikki thought of giving their relationship a second chance. The 90 Day Fiancé cast member booked a Mexico vacation three months later so they could connect all over again. This is when Justin told Nikki that she was the love of his life and proposed to her. Nikki then applied for the K-1 visa for the second time.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Nikki Sanders/Instagram\n"}

Episode 5 of the series ended with Daryl facing off against a stronger, faster zombie in a Pouvoir arena. The antagonistic group's leader, Genet, also plans to make Laurent support the Pouvoir to bring the Union of Hope under her control.\nNow, The Walking Dead (via WotNot) has released a trailer for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 6, revealing what to anticipate in the season finale.\nThe trailer reveals Daryl, Laurent, and Isabelle will be reunited following Daryl's escape from the fast zombie he's been forced to fight. As the group makes one last push for the Nest, Genet sends Codron after him, hoping he will finally enact his revenge after Daryl killed his brother.\nNow that it's confirmed Daryl will escape from the clutches of the Pouvoir, it appears he might make it to the Nest with Isabelle and Laurent. Given how important Laurent is for the Union of Hope, though, it's unclear whether he will continue to accompany Daryl on his future journey. This is especially because Daryl is still focused on getting home, despite forming a strong bond with Isabelle and Laurent on their way to the Nest.\nWhat's waiting for Daryl at home is currently unknown, though, given the mystery surrounding his latest conversation with Carol. A talk between the two in episode 5 revealed someone has returned to the Virginia communities, though Daryl is unable to discern who it is. This will likely be addressed in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2, which will seemingly see Carol cross the Atlantic to join Daryl in France.\nBecause of his future reunion with Carol - and the namesake of the show - it seems The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 1 finale won't show Codron get his revenge against Daryl. However, that doesn't mean Genet's loyal servant won't hurt someone else in Daryl's group that he's grown attached to. Just how much more suffering Daryl, Isabelle, and Laurent will face before arriving at the Nest will be clear once the finale airs next Sunday on AMC.\nSource: The Walking Dead (via WotNot)\n"}
{"title": "90 Day Fiancé Season 10: Ashley's Professional Witch Career Explained", "date": "2023-10-09 02:30:27", "text": "Ashley Michelle from New York revealed she's a professional witch during the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 premiere. A look at how she makes a living.\n90 Day Fiancé star Ashley Michelle is a witch for a living, but there’s more to her job than just tarot reading. Ashley is from Rochester, New York. She’s 33 years old. Ashley met her partner Manuel in Ecuador on New Year’s Eve 10 years ago. Manuel, 35, is a construction worker. He had asked Ashley to dance, and Ashley couldn’t resist Manuel’s bouncy hair and beautiful skin. She and Manuel were engaged within a week of meeting. Their long-distance relationship didn’t last, however, leading to their breakup. After spending seven years apart, Ashley and Manuel reconnected. He’s now coming to the U.S. to get married to Ashley.\nAshley’s spirituality guides every aspect of her life. The reality TV show newbie said she was a witch during the premiere episode. She is a tarot reader and an astrologer as well. Ashley also specializes in shadow work. As per Ashley, people are still afraid of the word witch. She claims it’s because they have been conditioned to believe that a witch is someone who has a crooked nose and crystal ball while throwing hexes at people. That’s not anything that Ashley does. Ashley’s family was religious when she was growing up, yet she became the “crazy one” because of her rebellious nature and soon began dabbling into the occult.\nOn Instagram, Ashley calls herself a “Spiritual Guide and Brand Alchemist.” Ashley has listed the services she offers to her interested clients in the link in her bio. One of them is called “SIREN.” It stands for “Sacred Initiation for Rebel Entrepreneurial Newbies.” It is a six-month group coaching business. It caters to those who want to be healers and spiritual practitioners or have “gifts to share with the world.” Ashley’s customers are those who have felt a “soul calling” and want to help others. She helps them get their branding and marketing right so they can find their “unique Siren song” to launch and grow their personal brand.\nIt’s not uncommon for 90 Day Fiancé cast members to have their own Cameo accounts. But Ashley had hers even before she became a reality TV star. One can book a personal video with Ashley for US $15. She can answer questions, give some advice and pep talk, or even roast someone when she’s not creating a birthday wish for her client. Ashley can also do a tarot card reading or give shutouts to small or big businesses if that’s the client’s requirement.\nAshley has her own podcast called “The Goddess Complex.” She describes it as an “eclectic podcast” which can cover “many layers of spiritual development from starseeds & rituals to running an online biz & moon magick.” Ashley’s podcast covers all the topics involved with spirituality. Ashley has released quite a few episodes so far with titles such as “I’ve Been Keeping Something From You” and \"Self Sabotage In Business.\"\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Ashley Michelle/Instagram, Ashley Michelle/Instagram, Ashley Michelle/Instagram, Siren, Cameo, The Goddess Complex\n"}
{"title": "How Daryl Dixon Got To France In The Walking Dead Revealed", "date": "2023-10-09 02:30:27", "text": "Daryl Dixon's Walking Dead spinoff takes place in France, but the mystery of how he got there is stretched across the spinoff's entire debut season.\nWarning: spoilers ahead for Daryl Dixon season 1.\nCompletely removing itself from AMC's wider The Walking Dead franchise, Daryl Dixon takes place primarily in France, but how Norman Reedus' titular protagonist traveled from the United States to Europe is a long and winding mystery. While The Walking Dead is hardly new to the spinoff game, Daryl Dixon represents the franchise's biggest paradigm shift yet, relocating the zombie horror action from U.S. shores to France. Without the benefit of commercial flights, explaining this journey after The Walking Dead's zombie virus ravaged civilization was always going to be a complex matter, and while Daryl Dixon does address the question fully, it does so across the entirety of its debut season.\nAdding to the mystery, Daryl Dixon season 1 recounts the tale of how Daryl reached France in non-chronological order. Episodes 1-4 fill in small details, before Daryl Dixon episode 5, \"Deux Amours,\" traces right back to the start, incorporating flashbacks to when Daryl was still on home soil. Finally, the sequence of events that led Monsieur Dixon to a beach near Marseille is now clear.\nRelated: The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon Cast & Character Guide\nIn The Walking Dead season 11's ending, Maggie sent Daryl away to discover more about the post-apocalyptic world, and that epic trip takes him all the way to the distant realm of Maine. Requiring bike fuel, Daryl accepts a deal from a stranger - gather zombies in exchange for gasoline. That a skeptical, cynical, lone wolf like Daryl would trust this man's proposal suggests operations like this have become common in The Walking Dead's world since the main TV show ended. Unfortunately for Daryl, this trade racket is actually run by Pouvoir des Vivants - a villainous group based in France and led by Genet.\nRelated: Daryl Dixon's New Walking Dead Spinoff Villains ExplainedThe zombies Daryl and his American friends round up are to be shipped off and used in Genet's zombie variant experiments. Nevertheless, the deal Daryl makes to work in exchange for gasoline is completely genuine. Had Daryl simply gathered the zombies as requested and taken his reward, he would have soon been enjoying Halloween treats in the Commonwealth, and the entire Daryl Dixon spinoff story could have been averted.\nAlas, Daryl breaks the rules by punching a fellow worker after realizing the man was responsible for murdering a young boy who was also part of their group. Both men are punished, with Genet's soldiers taking them prisoner, moving them to her offshore lab, and shoving them in a cell to be used for zombie food. This is evidently the fate that befalls anyone who breaks the rules while working for gasoline. Daryl loses his precious crossbow during the capture.\nDaryl Dixon avoids explaining the exact mechanics of what Genet is doing on the sea-faring vessel Daryl and his fellow prisoner get taken to, but episode 5's flashback leaves no doubt that Pouvoir des Vivants is using the boat as a lab to delve deeper into the arcane science of zombie variants. Not only does Daryl encounter a fast Climber zombie during his escape, but the apparatus aboard the ship is almost identical to the equipment spotted at Genet's castle in Daryl Dixon episode 3. In both scenes, a zombie head in a jar of fluid is hooked up to some unknown machinery. Likewise, the same unidentified scientist appears in both locations.\nRelated: All 5 Powers The Walking Dead's New Zombies HaveOne aspect of these experiments apparently involves controlling how much flesh a zombie consumes. Two cages of undead are glimpsed during Daryl Dixon episode 5's flashbacks - likely the same zombies Daryl and his cohorts were rounding up back in Maine. One cage is marked \"feed,\" while the other reads \"fast.\" Genet's prisoners are used for the former group, with an unlucky captive thrown into the rotting crowd at regular intervals.\nThanks to a successful \"play dead\" ruse and some classic Daryl Dixon head-bashing, Daryl and his fellow captive successfully break free, causing enough havoc among the ship's guards to reach a lifeboat. This small vessel is the same boat Daryl can be seen floating upon in Daryl Dixon's very first scene, face-down with a barely-conscious protagonist spread on top. Given how Daryl's friend accidentally drops the boat into the water rather than lowering it gently, and how Daryl then flings himself overboard to avoid an oncoming variant, it's possible that Daryl simply drags himself onto the upturned raft and stays that way for the entire trip.\nDaryl Dixon never reveals exactly where Genet's floating laboratory is located. Given that Daryl gets captured in Maine and Genet is based in Paris, the most likely guess is somewhere in the Atlantic between the United States and France. Daryl eventually washes south, then east, landing in the region of Marseille. This indicates that he must float past Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar, then across the Balearic Sea, before landing in southern France.\nTaking over France is a full-time job, and this raises questions over why Genet expends such great effort toward recapturing Daryl Dixon. Losing a prisoner is one thing, but Genet makes apprehending this rogue American a top priority, despite his initial crime being incredibly minor. Genet's science project can help to explain her seemingly disproportionate interest in a single prisoner. Daryl has seen the lab-boat, the experiments, the scientist involved, and knows the sinister truth behind why American survivors on the East Coast are being invited to hunt zombies in exchange for fuel. Genet simply cannot afford for Daryl to be roaming around freely.\nThe other reason concerns Daryl's messy escape. During the course of his jailbreak, Daryl all but decimates Genet's operation aboard the boat, letting her zombies out of their cages, killing multiple guards, spoiling her test subjects, and accidentally causing one or two small fires. As alluded to through Daryl Dixon's various nods to Charles de Gaulle, Genet perceives herself as the de facto ruler of France, and seeks to unite the country's survivors behind her flag. During her speech in Daryl Dixon episode 5, Genet draws a clear line between friends and enemies, so she likely views Daryl going unpunished as a show of weakness that would weaken her claim as leader.\nDaryl Dixon continues Sunday on AMC.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Who Came Back?!&quot; Massive Walking Dead Scene Teases Rick Grimes' Fate After Season 11", "date": "2023-10-09 02:25:29", "text": "A shocking exchange in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 seemingly teases a huge development related to Rick Grimes' fate in the franchise.\nWarning: Spoilers for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5\nA surprise scene in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 seemingly lays the groundwork for Rick Grimes to re-enter the picture. Of course, it’s no secret that the original Walking Dead hero is on his way back to the franchise. But details of his return for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live – and if he’ll ever reunite with his friends – remain shrouded in mystery.\nDue to plans for The Ones Who Live, Rick meeting with at least one Walking Dead character (Michonne) is assured at this point. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for everyone else. However, it’s always made sense that the franchise would want to work its way toward Rick crossing paths with his children, and perhaps old allies like Daryl and Carol as well. Thus far, Daryl has been on a fruitless mission to find Rick, but whether or not it would ever amount to anything was unclear. An unexpected development in this storyline appears to have finally presented itself in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5.\nThe message was distorted by static, but Carol could be heard telling Carol that someone “came back.” Purposely, the show ensured that the name was inaudible and ended their conservation, preventing Daryl from getting an answer when he asked, “who came back?” The episode never provided any possible explanations to the tease, but it’s obvious who viewers are meant to suspect. Of the characters absent from Alexandria, none stand out more than Rick Grimes. After all, Daryl spent much of his time looking for him after the explosion on the bridge and promised Judith he’d bring her father back.\nInterestingly, Rick isn’t the only candidate for this tease. Alternatively, Carol could mean Michonne, who left to find him in season 10. It’s not impossible that Michonne paid a visit to Alexandria before the events of their shared spinoff, The One Who Live. She’s already been away a while, and could decide to check in on her kids before heading back out to complete her mission to find Rick.\nA third option would be Heath, a confirmed victim of the CRM and a character who disappeared in season 7. Heath was never around long enough for his return to matter that much to Daryl, but his connection to the CRM – and by extension, Rick Grimes – would make his arrival in Alexandria something worth bringing up to Daryl. Lastly, there’s Fear the Walking Dead's Morgan, who may very well be going back to Alexandria now that he’s looking for Rick. However, he doesn’t have that deep of a history with Daryl, which is why a reference to him would seem insignificant.\nFurther reinforcing the idea that Rick’s return may have happened off-screen is Carol’s odd behavior during her talk with Daryl. Carol’s evasiveness made it clear that something was going on back at Alexandria that she felt reluctant to mention. If she didn’t want to talk about it, that could be a sign that it involves news that would alarm or distract Daryl. Rick suddenly coming back after being gone for more than a decade would certainly qualify. The same would be true if it’s Michonne that returned, as that too would connect with Rick’s Walking Dead story in some way. Either way, chances are things aren’t as “quiet” in Alexandria as Carol suggests.\nA big part of what made Daryl Dixon episode 5’s big tease such a shocking moment is the idea that Rick Grimes is expected to be busy dealing with the CRM in The Ones Who Live. In spite of that, The Walking Dead is hinting that Rick will come home regardless. Rick wanting to reach Alexandria does make sense, considering that he has family and friends there. Getting back there may have been his goal all along, but the CRM has been standing in the way. That was made evident when he was shown failing to escape from their clutches in The Walking Dead series finale.\nWhile seeing his loved ones may be the main point of going back, it’s not the only motivation he might have. A more pressing reason may be the threat posed by the CRM. It would be out of character for Rick to bring them into his fight and put them in harm’s way, but that’s a risk Rick might take if Alexandria is already on their radar. The CRM has potential Lance Hornsby connections, so there’s at least a chance the CRM has targeted them over what happened to Lance in season 11. If so, Rick could be trying to warn them of the danger that’s about to arrive on their doorstep.\nAs exciting as it would be for Rick to reunite with so many of his friends from The Walking Dead, doing so would further muddle the Walking Dead timeline. Firstly, The Walking Dead: Dead City takes place after the events of Daryl Dixon, meaning that any monumental developments should have been addressed in Maggie and Negan’s spinoff. Naturally, Rick coming back would be too big of an event to ignore; it’s hard to imagine the former leader of the core group coming back into the fold not being referenced by either Negan or Maggie. This also applies to whatever problem Carol was hinting at in episode 5.\nClearly, Daryl Dixon’s “who came back?” exchange with Carol is instrumental to what comes next for The Walking Dead franchise, whether it specifically refers to Rick Grimes or not. Presumably, the Daryl Dixon season finale will hinge on Daryl’s ongoing struggles in France, hence why it’s probably not going to offer any explanation as to who Carol meant. With this in mind, there’s little doubt that the purpose of this scene was to build a new mystery for the franchise to solve sometime after season 1. And since it pertains directly to the people of Alexandria, it implies the return of more familiar faces.\nThis prospect supports mounting theories of a massive Walking Dead crossover. Morgan’s search for Rick and Daryl’s own intention to find him both build evidence for the idea that The Walking Dead plans to unite its characters once more. A new mystery unfolding in place that isn’t the current setting of a spinoff only strengthens that possibility. It could be that after The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, The Ones Who Live, and Dead City, they’ll all come together to fight the CRM in an epic war to end the franchise.\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon releases new episodes on Sundays on AMC.\n"}
{"title": "Daryl Dixon Now Knows The 2 Biggest Secrets In The Walking Dead", "date": "2023-10-09 02:25:29", "text": "Daryl Dixon began his French spinoff adventure as a humble traveler, but now knows the two biggest secrets in the entire Walking Dead universe.\nWarning: spoilers ahead for Daryl Dixon episode 5.\nDaryl Dixon has officially made its title character privy to the two best-kept, lore-shattering secrets in AMC's entire The Walking Dead franchise. Daryl Dixon's French vacation may have happened entirely by accident, but Norman Reedus' rugged hero has gained a great deal during his time there, making friends with religious rebels, landing himself an adopted son, and enjoying Mork & Mindy reruns. Daryl Dixon even found a new signature weapon to replace his crossbow. More valuable than all of the above, however, Daryl has gained two vital pieces of knowledge that will change his understanding of the zombie outbreak forever.\nAs revealed in The Walking Dead: World Beyond's ending, France is the most important country in the franchise. Not only is France where the zombie outbreak allegedly started, but the land famous for its \"246 varieties of cheese\" seemingly has just as many zombie variants, including the lethal Burner zombies Daryl encountered in episode 1. Because of the country's immense narrative importance, setting Daryl Dixon in France always looked like a calculated move on AMC's part. That proves to be the case in Daryl Dixon episode 5, \"Deux Amours,\" which confirms Daryl knows two big secrets that he didn't before.\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond attributed the zombie outbreak to a group of French scientists led by the enigmatic \"Primrose Team,\" members of which have since been imprisoned or executed. During Genet's speech in Daryl Dixon episode 5, the villain alludes toward this, proclaiming, \"Finally, out of greed and hubris, they [the ruling elite] unleashed this plague upon the world... They gave us this disease... Their disease can be our cure.\" Genet may not mention specific names, but her rant does explicitly mention both how the virus started in France, and that it was human-made. She also heavily implies that the scientists responsible were funded by wealthy sponsors, which seems logical enough.\nAs Genet spouts this vitriolic exposition, Daryl watches on from the gladiatorial pit below. The room's PA system ensures Daryl has no choice but to hear Genet's words, and the revelations contained within should be completely new to his naive ears. Throughout The Walking Dead's 11 seasons, Rick Grimes and his merry band of survivors remained completely ignorant to how the zombie outbreak began. Even a CDC encounter with Dr. Jenner shed no light on The Walking Dead's virus origin, with the French scientists evidently keeping their culpability hidden from international colleagues.\nDaryl Dixon episode 5 is, therefore, the first time Daryl would have heard any details regarding the zombie virus being created in a French lab, making him one of precious few Walking Dead characters to learn the truth. As Genet's prisoner, Daryl doesn't exactly have time to digest this information - especially since he's about to find himself on the wrong side of an undead gladiatorial showdown. Once the dust settles, however, the massive significance of Genet's speech about the zombie virus may finally register in Daryl Dixon's mind.\nHow The Walking Dead's zombie virus started is not the only secret Daryl has learned since departing U.S. shores. Following his capture in Maine, Daryl wound up as a prisoner on Genet's floating lab. Not only did Daryl encounter a super-fast climber during his escape attempt, but he undoubtedly would have noticed the various zombie experiments taking place aboard the vessel. While Daryl Dixon has never claimed to be as erudite as Eugene or as cunning as Carol, he can surely put these pieces together and figure out that Genet is somehow engineering zombie variants.\nDaryl's experience in France has only confirmed this truth further. As a combatant in Genet's arena at the end of episode 5, Daryl Dixon watches on as one of her zombie subjects is injected with a bright green substance, then suddenly bursts forward at great speed. Zombie variants are not, in themselves, new to Daryl. Rick's group encountered them briefly during The Walking Dead season 1, then more prominently in season 11. Nobody in the main show, however, knew where these super-zombies came from, resulting in wild speculation from Aaron and a humble \"what the f**k...?\" from Negan.\nWhile the finer details of zombie variants are yet to be revealed, Daryl has at least uncovered their connection to Genet's Pouvoir des Vivants. He has also personally witnessed a drug that, upon being administered to a member of the undead community, turns a zombie into a raging weapon, rather than just a lumbering nuisance. Combined with the details Genet reveals about the outbreak, Daryl is now significantly wiser than he was at the end of The Walking Dead season 11.\nDaryl's newfound insight into The Walking Dead's zombie lore has massive implications for the wider franchise. Assuming Daryl eventually makes contact with the Commonwealth and his old pals, he can pass the information on. That would mean all major characters from The Walking Dead would finally know how the outbreak began, more or less, as well as why some zombies have leveled-up. These tidbits would then spread across the United States, illuminating the apocalypse for those who survived long enough to find out.\nDaryl being the bearer of zombie news was actually set up by The Walking Dead's series finale. Maggie sent Daryl away to \"find out about\" the wider post-outbreak situation, but, as confirmed by Daryl himself in Daryl Dixon episode 1, all he found was trouble. Had Daryl not been captured by Pouvoir des Vivants in Maine, he would have returned to the Commonwealth having failed in his mission spectacularly. Thanks to his French detour, Daryl will now come home carrying two massive secrets to share with Maggie and his old friends.\nDaryl Dixon continues Sunday on AMC.\n"}

Her son, Juance, was introduced in episode 1.\n90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda has kept a lot of secrets from her fans, including information about her two sons, which she’s finally revealing in season 10. Jasmine, from Panama City, became a famous face in the world of reality TV since her 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days debut. Jasmine, 36, and her partner, Gino Palazzolo, 53, struggled to find a balance in their relationship while dealing with issues such as jealousy, anger, and insecurity. Following their engagement and almost two years of waiting, Jasmine got a K-1 visa to move to Michigan and get married.\nJasmine has two sons with her ex-husband. She spoke about them during her introduction in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Jasmine had said her oldest son lived with her ex-husband and the youngest with her. Jasmine’s younger son had a very hard time during the pandemic with the city being under lockdown. Jasmine and her mother, Cecelia, decided to take him to stay with her mom in the countryside. However, this was a temporary arrangement.\nJasmine revealed the names of her sons in her 90 Day Fiancé season 10 debut episode. Juance accompanied his grandmother and aunt Liz to Jasmine’s apartment as his mom packed her bags to move to America. “The eldest is Juance,” Jasmine said. She confessed that the connection she has with Juance is “out of this world.” She loves taking him for ice cream and fast food, which Juance isn't allowed when he's with his dad. Jasmine waited for a year after she first met Gino to introduce him to her kids. “Because I wanted to make sure it was something long-lasting. Any mother would understand that,” Jasmine explained.\nJasmine’s sons got along very well with Gino despite them speaking different languages. Watching them interact was a “beautiful moment” for Jasmine that she would never forget. When fans used to ask Jasmine why she never posted her sons’ pictures on social media, Jasmine said it was because she agreed with their father to not share information about them online. Jasmine said her ex-husband is a doctor and also a lawyer. However, Jasmine’s ex-husband is now fine with the boys going with Jasmine to the U.S.\nJasmine had not told Juance that she was leaving Panama. She had told him that she was getting a visa, but not that it was approved, and moving to the U.S. Even if her kids have a comfortable life in Panama, it’s Jasmine and Gino’s plan to bring them to the U.S. as soon as possible. Jasmine told Juance about her moving with great difficulty during the 90 Day Fiancé premiere. She told him he would be staying with his dad, his aunt, and grandma until Jasmine could figure out where they would live and which school he would attend. “Juance really wants to move to America,” Jasmine laughed.\nShe thinks it was Gino who put the idea in Juance’s mind. No child would want to be separated from their mother, even if it was temporary. As of now, Jasmine has not revealed if she’s managed to bring the kids to the U.S. Jasmine is there now, and is possibly already married to Gino since she came to the U.S. more than three months ago. Jasmine may bring Juance and JC to live with her and Gino and won’t hesitate to share the happy news with her followers once it happens.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}

UK native Sophie is going to get married to Los Angeles man Rob Warne.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 introduces a new cast member named Sophie Sierra, whose past is as interesting as her relationship with Rob Warne. Sierra, a 23-year-old living in Londo,n had been in an online relationship with Rob, 32, from Los Angeles, for six months. The couple decided to take the next step when Sophie moved to the U.S. for two months. She stayed with Rob in his house, which was a stark contrast to where she’d lived all her life. Sophie comes from a wealthy family, even though she may not know what her rich grandpa did for a living all his life.\nThe fact that the reality TV show couple has financial inequalities between them isn’t the only red flag about Sophie and Rob. Sophie had been on a dating app while she was in America, and Rob had also been speaking to another girl online during a rough patch they had. Sophie is also hiding the fact that she’s bisexual from Rob. But the real reason why Sophie and Rob started dating is very special to Sophie. It is because they bonded over everything they’d been through as mixed-race children who faced a lot of pain growing up.\nSophie opened up about her tough experiences in life during her 90 Day Fiancé introduction. Sophie said she was mixed race. Sophie’s dad is Black, while her mom is White. Sophie's mom, Claire, made an appearance in episode 1. Sophie said she's been very close to her mom since she was little because she had no siblings. Sophie moved to England when she was 16 years old, and her mom moved with her. Sophie's mom is not Rob's biggest fan, but she wants her mom to get along with him because they will eventually become a family once Sophie gets married.\nSophie was raised in Spain, where there weren’t any Black people, so she was the only mixed or Black kid in the whole school. Growing up, Sophie was bullied. She did not have any friends at school. Sophie believes that despite going through difficult things, she’s really thankful for them. Sophie says these experiences led her to become the person she is today. Her experiences also led to her meeting the love of her life, Rob.\nBefore she met Rob, Sophie followed several Instagram pages featuring mixed-race men. She saw Rob on one of these pages and followed him because she thought he was cute. Sophie and Rob connected via text messages and FaceTime. Even if they were from opposite sides of the world, and even if she was raised in a “nice area” and he was raised in a “rough area,” Sophie and Rob had very similar childhood experiences. Like Sophie, Rob also never fit in anywhere and was bullied.

Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles novel trilogy remixed the legend of King Arthur with some historical fact and presented a largely grounded take on the myth. That's not to say the bolly abandoned the fantasy elements, as Merlin still played a major role. The Winter King show cast Nathaniel Martello-White as Merlin, where he acts as a mentor to Arthur (Iain De Caestecker) while often disagreeing with his decisions.\nFor the first half of season 1, magic hasn't played much of a role, though Merlin's \"Death of Britain\" visions certainly suggested bad things to come. The sixth episode digs a little deeper into Merlin's abilities, as he decides to set out on an adventure to retrieve an important object. He also confirms to Arthur that his new sword is Excalibur and that Merlin himself brought it over from Ireland years before; the fact it found its way into Arthur's hands makes it seem like the Gods really wanted him to have it.\nRelated: Who The Saxons Are In The Winter King Season 1: Real History & Arthurian Enemies Explained\nMerlin has been lacking in subplots for much of Winter King season 1, aside from an ill-advised attempt to kidnap baby Mordred. The heir to the throne of Dumnonia is, according to Merlin's visions, destined to become a bloodthirsty tyrant who will lead to the end of Britain. Merlin thus tried to take Mordred and planned to drop him off at a village, where he would be raised with no idea of his royal heritage. Arthur foiled this plan, but episode 6 gives Merlin a new task. He has a vision of entering a snowy cave, where he discovers the Horn of Bran.\nThis is said to be one of the fabled Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, which are a series of magical items found in Welsh manuscripts that date back to the 15th Century. The Horn of Brân Galed from the North is said to be filled with whatever drink a person desires; so if they want an endless supply of wine, the horn will provide it. Merlin sets out on a quest to the wilderness in the North to recover the horn and believes that if he recovers it, he can find the other treasures too.\nThe manuscripts always state that there are thirteen treasures of Britain, though some texts change what those items are. Some even list Arthur's sword Excalibur among those magical objects. Here are the rest of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain:\nWhite-Hilt, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael the Generous - It's said that if a well-born man draws this sword, it would ignite in flame. Rhydderch was one of the Three Generous Men of Britain and was always willing to hand the sword over to those who asked. However, nobody ever asked when they learned what it did.\nThe Hamper of Gwyddno Long-Shank - A hamper that is said to multiply the food placed into it a hundredfold.\nThe Chariot of Morgan Mwynfawr (AKA the Chariot of Morgan the Wealthy) - A special chariot that will take someone wherever they wish to go really quickly.\nThe Halter of Clydno Eiddy - Also known as The Handy Halter, this will summon whatever horse a person wishes for in the halter.\nThe Knife of Llawfrodedd the Horseman - A knife that is said to serve up to 24 men at a table.\nThe Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant - A cauldron that distinguishes the brave from the cowardly. So if a brave man puts meat in the caldron, it will boil fast. However, if a so-called coward puts meat in, it wouldn't boil at all.\nThe Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd - Once again, an object to separate the strong from the weak. If a brave warrior sharpened their sword on this whetstone it would kill anyone it drew blood from; if a coward did the sharpening, their sword wouldn't even draw blood.\nThe Coat of Padarn Beisrudd - Yet another item that discriminates against cowards. This coat will fit those who are brave, but it won't fit weaklings.\nThe Crock and Dish of Rhygenydd Ysgolhaig - Similar to the Horn of Bran, this will serve whatever food a person desires.\nChessboard of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio - A large golden chessboard where if the pieces (which are made of silver and crystal) are set up right, they'll play themselves.\nThe Mantle of Arthur in Cornwall - This renders anybody under it invisible, but it allows them to see out.\nThe Stone and Ring of Eluned the Fortunate - A ring that Merlin already seems to possess in Winter King. Like the aforementioned Mantle of Arthur, this renders the wearer invisible.\nMerlin believes that if he retrieves the Horn of Bran - which Nimue (Ellie James) claims is the most difficult item to find - then the others will soon follow. If they complete this sidequest in The Winter King, Merlin claims the objects will give them back the power to reclaim Britain. That might be wishful thinking on his part, but it'll be interesting to see what happens if he can actually recover them all.\n"}

Sophie is a 23-year-old who lives in London, England. Sophie is in love with Rob Warne from Los Angeles. Sophie came across 32-year-old Rob on Instagram. Mixed-race Sophie was following Instagram pages for mixed-race men. He was the only man she followed because she found him cute. Rob usually ignored the women who reached out to him on social media, but he was surprised when he saw the reality TV show star. The couple started talking on DM, where the first thing Rob told Sophie was that if he had a girl like her, he’d stop looking.\nEven if they were from opposite sides of the world, Sophie and Rob felt the connection due to their similar pasts where they faced bullying and racism. After talking for six months, Sophie flew to LA, where she ended up staying with Rob for two months. Sophie put the idea of the K-1 visa in Rob’s head. They got engaged, and now Rob is worried about Sophie not relating to him because of how different their backgrounds are, especially financially. Sophie expects Rob to move out of his studio apartment, which doesn’t even have a bathroom. Rob knows it’s not the ideal place for him to bring Sophie, who he calls a princess.\nSophie does fashion modeling and content creation for work. She refers to them as \"social media things.\" Sophie has listed down some of the benefits of her job. She doesn’t have to stay in one place to do her work. Sophie could be traveling around the world and still making content for her social media profiles. Currently, Sophie has 132k plus followers on Instagram alone. She shares pictures from her travels across the world. In some of her old pictures, Sophie sports dark, brunette hair, making her look quite different from her blonde 90 Day Fiancé season 10 look.\nOne of the perks of her job is that Sophie gets “free clothes.” Sophie can be seen modeling for various fashion brands on her IG page. In fact, most of Sophie’s content is pictures of her in different stylish outfits and showing off her fit physique. An older video on Sophie’s Instagram profile reveals she used to have the username @sophiecheshire and recorded dance videos for her followers to see. Sophie may not have mentioned it on 90 Day Fiancé, but she also makes music.

{"title": "10 Slice Of Life Anime Featuring Criminals", "date": "2023-10-09 02:02:02", "text": "From Spy x Family to The Way of the Househusband, these anime series perfectly mix slice-of-life elements with memorable criminal characters.\nSlice of life anime is usually concerned with grounded and relatable matters, hence the name, but that's exactly what makes these series that feature criminals all the more fun. Whilst it's almost always more high-stakes series that dominate the anime scene, slice-of-life series have been growing ever more prominent in recent years. Series like Spy X Family and My Dress-Up Darling both became surprise hits in 2022, largely because of the slice-of-life elements that made them eminently watchable.\nThe popularity of Spy X Family and its central characters, who harbor some dark and very illegal secrets, might be particularly interesting for anime fans into heist or crime stories too. However, it's far from the only great anime to hilariously combine criminals and everyday life. From shows where the criminals are a source of real drama, like Beastars, to ones where they're the butt of all the jokesm like The Way of the Househusband, there are tons of slice-of-life anime series where criminals play a big part.\nRELATED: 10 Best Anime About Having A Pet\nThough The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting isn't the first slice-of-life anime to imagine a criminal being forced into a situation where they need to care for a small child, they proved that there was still plenty of humor to be found from the premise last year. Its criminal main character is Tooru Kirishima, a yakuza member feared for his violent nature when enforcing the will of his boss.\nHowever, in this uplifting slice-of-life anime, he's forced to take a more tactful approach when he's suddenly tasked with taking care of the boss's precious daughter. Showing their everyday lives as the two slowly come to understand each other, it's the clash in personalities between the two that's the source of the best comedy and the best heartfelt moments that The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting has to offer.\nWhilst it's primarily a supernatural action show, there are enough slice-of-life elements in the intriguing Durarara!! to keep fans of the everyday-focused genre interested. Like a regular slice-of-life show, the strength of Durarara!! lies in its characters, which include a mysterious dark figure on a bike, the devious information broker Izaya, and the rough-edged bodyguard Shizuo.\nDurarara!! is a great anime for beginners that weaves multiple plotlines together, including moments that show the everyday lives of its high-schooler main characters as they try to piece together the supernatural events that seem to be occurring in their dangerous part of town. Even they themselves might be more involved in criminal activity than they let on, making the show an intriguing mystery that's worth unwrapping.\nWhilst The Way of the Househusband's central character, Tatsu, seems to have left a life of crime behind, that doesn't mean the series isn't full of current or former Yakuza members getting in the way of his newfound peaceful life as a stay-at-home husband. Once a notorious gangster, Tatsu approaches housework and being a good husband with the same zeal and seriousness as any criminal activity.\nThe Way Of The Househusband is a relatively short and sweet anime series and the animation itself is fairly bare-bones, but for anyone that enjoys the humor of an absurdly rough former Yakuza member dealing with everyday situations like shopping for groceries, the show's compact nature only makes it more of a joy. Funny and unique, the series gets an unbelievable amount of feel-good fun out of its former criminal protagonist.\nMuch like how the game combines ordinary social simulation with supernatural elements, Persona 4 the Animation mixes fun slice-of-life with an absorbing mystery centered on a series of brutal serial killings taking place in the rural town of Inaba. With the help of a strange phenomenon involving a TV channel, the high-schooler protagonists attempt to stop the killings.\nThough the serial killer is largely a background figure, the presence of the hilarious delinquent Kanji Tatsumi, terror of the local police and gangs alike, more than makes up for it. Adapted from the amazing JRPG of the same name, Persona 4 the Animation might not be a match for the game in terms of slice-of-life content or fun action, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining in its own right.\nAnother series in the surprisingly flourishing niche of shows where criminals end up taking care of young children, Hinamatsuri is slightly different in that the child in question is far from an ordinary one either. Materializing in a strange metal pod in front of Yakuza member Yoshifumi Nitta, she comes with some strange and dangerous powers that mean looking after her is a lot more fraught than usual.\nWhether she proves a valuable asset to Nitta in his criminal affairs or whether she ends up blowing him up instead, the familial relationship that forms between the two makes up the heart of the show. Despite being an anime with a unique reverse isekai premise, Hinamatsuri thrives on the same everyday wholesomeness that all the best slice-of-life shows have, and just as importantly, it has many laugh-out-loud moments.\nProof that a slice-of-life series can be one of the most popular anime of the year when combined with just enough crime and intrigue to keep action fans happy too, Spy X Family is a comedy like no other. Its central family might seem ordinary, but it was actually put together by international spy Loid Forger and, unbeknownst to him, he might not even be the most dangerous criminal in the group.\nWith his fictional wife, Yor, secretly an underground assassin, and his child, Anya, able to read minds, everyone in the family has their secrets but that doesn't mean they can't share heartwarming moments to rival the best slice-of-life shows. Along with Spy X Family's hilarious side characters, it's a recipe for hilarity and fun like no other and it's no surprise a second season is already on the way this year.\nRELATED: 15 Longest-Running Anime Of All Time\nFor a fresh slice-of-life comedy centered on criminals, Buddy Daddies began airing in January and has already gained fans looking for something to scratch that itch. The series begins with the professional assassins Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa about to pull off an elaborate scheme to kill a mob boss on Christmas Eve, but before it can become a very different kind of show, in wanders a lost four-year-old girl.\nWith their plan foiled, the pair end up taking the energetic Miri home and soon find fatherhood comes naturally to them despite their dangerous careers. Buddy Daddies is fast-paced and the jokes and action might be a little too non-stop for viewers hoping to experience a more laid-back slice-of-life anime. Despite that, the hijinks the pair get into whilst trying to keep the ever-unpredictable Miri safe in a dangerous world make for a great time.\nThough it leans more toward an old-fashioned gag comedy style than a typical slice-of-life format, the hilarious way it shows superheroes and criminal masterminds in the most mundane situations means Tentai Senshi Sunred fits rights into the genre. The show is centered on the daily lives of Sunred, an ally of justice, and General Vamp, head of an evil organization bent on taking over the world.\nWhilst that might make it sound more like high drama, it turns out their everyday lives are as ordinary as everyone else's, with Sunred a lazy gambling addict and Vamp a polite conscientious homemaker who takes good care of his minions. The best slice-of-life anime might have ridiculous premises but Tentai Senshi Sunred has them all beat with a short, punchy format that brings out all the absurd comedy of the contrasting hero and villain pair.\nRELATED: 10 Best Isekai Anime Of All Time According To IMDb\nIf some of the criminals that typically feature in slice-of-life anime aren't dangerous enough, Jormungand steps things up by centering on characters that are actually international criminals, illegally selling weapons whilst trying to avoid the wrath of the CIA. Despite the high stakes involved, Jormungand dwells on the ordinary elements of the life of Jonah, a bodyguard tasked with protecting the gang's leader.\nThat doesn't mean there isn't plenty of violence and action to enjoy in Jormungand too. At its heart, the show is an action series and it's more than satisfying when it comes to well-animated set pieces to set the heart racing. Whilst it might not be a charming low-stakes anime affair that slice-of-life fans often expect, Jormungand is one of the few shows that attempts to seriously portray the everyday lives of criminals, and that gives it a unique appeal.\nSlice-of-life anime series revolving around high-school clubs might be incredibly common, but Beastars is different in that it takes place in a society comprised of anthropomorphic animals where carnivores and herbivores co-exist despite a heavy suspicion of one another. Despite rising tensions, Legoshi finds himself developing a bond with a white rabbit he meets while on lookout for the drama club.\nWhilst Legoshi struggles with his carnivorous nature, the world turns out to be even more violent and twisted than it seems as the Lion Yakuza gang comes to play a major role. Despite that, it's a show that's at its best when showing the mundane lives of its characters as they grow and learn from each other. Featuring one of the best slice-of-life anime protagonists ever in the form of Legoshi, that's no surprise either.\nMORE: 10 Slice-Of-Life Anime That Focus On Clubs\nA freelance list writer for Screen Rant, Jordan Woods has already written well over 300 pieces for the site since he began in 2021.

Gino no longer has a job to spend money on Jasmine.\n90 Day Fiancé star Gino Palazzolo doesn’t have a job in season 10, and he had not told Jasmine Pineda about it. Gino and Jasmine were first seen on reality TV show 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5, in which they documented their first in-person meeting. While Gino, 52, was in Panama with Jasmine, 36, she found out he was sending her nude photos to an ex. As per Jasmine, the pictures circulated online and reached her workplace,e leading to her being fired. The American literature teacher then became dependent on Gino for money. On 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Jasmine is coming to Michigan to get married to Gino.\nJasmine has already shown how bad she is at making financial decisions. Before leaving Panama, Gino gave Jasmine money to buy a wedding dress. She, instead, spent it on getting a Brazilian Butt Lift. Jasmine lost weight and felt getting implants was necessary but has not told Gino about it. Jasmine wishes Gino were more appreciative of her getting her nails, hair, and laser hair removal done because she thinks it’s her putting in effort to look pretty. Jasmine thinks Gino is cheap. It will be interesting to see how she reacts after finding out he doesn’t even have a job to spend and can't spend lavishly on her.\nGino was laid off from his job when he was introduced on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Gino used to work at Ford as an engineering program manager. He worked there for a year. His last job was at Faurecia in the product development position. Gino’s LinkedIn profile still shows he works there, which could mean it hasn’t been updated yet. Gino has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. He began working in September 1993 as a product design and release engineer.\nHowever, in 90 Day Fiancé season 10, episode 1, the cameras caught Gino walking out of his office on his last day there. Gino said he had told his boss that he needed to take a leave of absence from his job for a while. Gino had no plans of coming back for a year. Gino wanted to make Jasmine a “priority” and help her get on her feet in Michigan. This included helping Jasmine get her social security number, driver’s license, etc. Gino was worried that Jasmine would return to Panama if she couldn’t adapt to her new American life.\nGino was still helping Jasmine out with her rent and bills. Gino was helping Jasmine “quite a bit financially” after she lost her teaching job. According to Gino, the hard part was that Jasmine had become spoiled, and coming to Michigan would give her a “taste of reality.” Gino was looking to buy a treadmill for Jasmine, but he didn’t go ahead with the purchase because of his “tight budget.” Moreover, Gino had not told Jasmine about him quitting his job.\n“Because Jasmine likes to live the luxury good life, and I don’t have any income or money, oh my god, she’s gonna kill me,” Gino confessed. He felt it was best for him to wait until she could come to the U.S. Gino was going to tell Jasmine about him not having a job when Jasmine came to Michigan. Living together in America will not be a cakewalk for this 90 Day Fiancé season 10 pair.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Gino Palazzolo/LinkedIn, Gino Palazzolo/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "The Winter King Season 1 Episode 6 Recap: 7 Biggest Story Reveals", "date": "2023-10-09 02:01:26", "text": "The Winter King episode 6 introduces a major character from the King Arthur legend, while Derfel finally sees his biggest wish come true.\nWarning: Major spoilers for The Winter King season 1 episode 6 below!\nThe Winter King episode 6 features some big changes for Arthur, including the introduction of a key character from the legend. This MGM+ adaptation of the Bernard Cornwell novels offers a gritty reinvention of the King Arthur myth, with a healthy dash of Game of Thrones thrown in. The first five episodes detailed the return of Arthur (Iain De Caestecker) to Britain years after he was banished by his father King Uther (Eddie Marsan), and finding it divided and on the verge of being overtaken by Saxon invaders.\nArthur has no particular desire to become king following Uther's death, he is the only one with a sense of clarity about what must be done to save the country. While Winter King lacks the epic bombast of later Game of Thrones seasons, it's doing a good job of bringing the legend down to Earth. That's not to say the fantasy elements have been completely cast aside, as episode 6 proves. Some big changes are on the horizon for Arthur, and his plan to unite the kingdoms might be finished before it even begins.\nRelated: The Winter King Cast & Character Guide: Who's Who In The MGM+ King Arthur Show\nWinter King episode 5 ended with Arthur fighting in a duel with best friend Owain (Daniel Ings), who had led a raid that ended in the deaths of innocent miners. While Owain tried to weasel out of responsibility, Arthur dubbed him a \"coward\" for his acts and the two had a vicious battle. This ended with Arthur running Owain through with his new sword Excalibur, and the sixth episode picks up in the immediate aftermath of this. Arthur cradles Owain's body, while everyone else in the kingdom stands around in shock.\nRegardless, Merlin (Nathaniel Martello-White) arrives and comforts him, before raising Arthur's arm and declaring him the new ruler of Dumnonia. Before Uther's death, he had named three defenders for his baby heir Mordred: Owain, Bishop Bedwin (Steven Elder) and Gundleus (Simon Merrells). With the latter being a murderous traitor, Owain being killed by Arthur and Mordred obviously being too young to rule, this is why the leadership role falls to Arthur.\nStill in shock over Owain's death, Arthur is later seen in his quarter polishing Excalibur. Merlin comes to speak with him and reveals Arthur didn't find his \"mother's\" sword by accident. In fact, Merlin confirms the sword is indeed the mythical Excalibur, and that he himself got it from a druid in Ireland years earlier. Merlin gave the sword to Arthur's mother, who decided not to give it to her son in case Uther suspected Athur of potential treason. The fact Arthur later found the sword by himself is taken as a good sign by Merlin, as he believes it gave him the strength to win the duel.\nThe first episode of Winter King opened with Arthur saving a young Derfel from a spike pit, where he was placed by Gundleus' people. Naturally, Derfel grew up with serious hero envy for Arthur and dreamed of becoming one of his warriors. The first half of season 1 made it clear Derfel isn't suited for civilian life, so when Arthur is making the trip to Caer Dolforwyn, he stops by Avalon.\nThis is where he makes Derfel's wish come true by asking him to become one of his warriors. After his time with Owain, Derfel has gotten a taste of how the life of a warrior isn't as noble as he once believed, but he still accepts the offer without hesitation. He soon gets a makeover by Arthur's men and joins them on the trip to Gorfydd's (Aneirin Hughes) kingdom.\nGundleus almost rivals Game of Thrones' Ramsay Bolton in terms of vileness, but despite being so hated on the show itself, he's surprisingly lucky. His massacre on Avalon saw him murder a baby, commit sexual assault and kill Queen Norwena (Grace Ackary), but the fact he's the nephew of Gorfydd saw Arthur spare him as a bargaining chip. Gorfydd's past experience with Uther has given him little faith in Dumnonia, but as a sign of respect, Arthur releases his nephew.\nOf course, the priestess Nimue (Ellie James) has more reason than anyone to hate Gundleus and doesn't take the news well. When she and Arthur talk later, Nimue tells him she will still have her revenge on Gundleus, no matter how long she has to wait. For now, at least, the \"vagabond\" king is safe from harm.\nIn addition to releasing Gundleus, Arthur also suggests that he marry Gorfydd's daughter Ceinwyn (Emily John) as a way to unite their kingdoms. While this offer sounded good on paper and Arthur sees how it will only strengthen the bonds between Dumnonia and the other kingdoms, he soon has doubts about going through with it. He and Ceinwyn - who is also nervous about the prospect of marrying a stranger - go through with their betrothal ceremony, but time will tell if he commits to the actual wedding in a future episode. Given that he's now smitten with somebody else, the odds are strong he will back out.\nMerlin's big subplot in Winter King episode 6 involves him having a vision of stumbling upon an icy cave and recovering the Horn of Bran from it. This horn is part of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, which are mythical items said to be infused with magic properties. They can be anything from a coat to a special weapon, with the Horn Of Bran said to grant whoever drinks from it whatever beverage they desire.\nRelated: The Winter King's Nimue Explained: Arthurian Legend & Lady Of The Lake Mythology\nSo if they wished to consume an endless supply of red wine, the horn would provide it. Merlin believes that if he recovers the horn, he will be able to find the rest of the treasures too. Nimue believes Merlin is setting about this mission to \"appease\" the Gods, but he thinks recovering the items will help them reclaim Britain. Thus, Merlin set out on a quest to the wilderness in the North to hunt for the Horn of Bran, which is said to be the most difficult item to find.\nThe latest episode finally introduces Guinevere (Jordan Alexandra), who is revealed to be Ceinwyn's best friend. The night before he meets Ceinwyn, Arthur and his men rest in a local forest. He goes for a walk and sees Guinevere and her horse from a distance. After a shout out to the Lady of the Lake - a role traditionally taken by Nimue in King Arthur stories - Guinevere speaks to him under the assumption he's just one of Arthur's men. There's clearly an instant attraction, and while she's not impressed when he learns who he really is, she offers a sympathetic ear when he confesses his guilt over Owain's death.\nThe Winter King's version of Guinevere lost her lands in an Irish raid when she was young, and having been raised in Gorfydd's kingdom, is as close to Ceinwyn as a sister. She's a shrewd thinker too, as she reveals in her thoughts about the politics of Arthur marrying Ceinwyn. Having seemingly never read the legends of King Arthur himself, Gorfydd insists that Guinevere accompanies Ceinwyn in her married life. Assuming Arthur does go through with the marriage, the fact he and Guinevere will still be around one another will presumably lead to an affair.\n"}
{"title": "Nightwing's Anti-Batman Contingency Plan Confirms Bruce Has Finally Gone Too Far", "date": "2023-10-09 01:00:27", "text": "As Batman starts going off the deep end, Nightwing activates a protocol that reminds him of the sacred oath he swore when he first became a hero.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for Batman #138!If fans didn't think the Dark Knight was losing it, Nightwing's unexpected anti-Batman contingency might make them think otherwise. \"Gotham War\" is intensifying and a vow from the past makes a heartbreaking return.\nIn Batman #138 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jimenez, Bruce has gone beyond the pale during his war with Catwoman. He's kidnapped Jason Todd and conditioned him to experience fear whenever his adrenaline gets too high, rendering him unable to fight. To aid the Bat-Family's search for Red Hood, Nightwing finds Batman's remote system and attempts to access it before he's interrupted by Damian Wayne.\nThankfully, Tim Drake gives Nightwing the time he needs to access Batman's remote system and figure out what he's up to. Unfortunately, it requires an audible passphrase that Bruce entrusted to Dick Grayson: The same vow Nightwing swore the day he pledged to become a crime-fighter. Before Nightwing can finish the phrase, Batman does it for him. He chews his former sidekick out, saying that Dick has forgotten the promise he made long ago. Nightwing, however, says that it's Batman that's gone too far, only to be proven right when Dick discovers the awful conditioning Batman has done to Red Hood.\nThings are rapidly going to hell for Nightwing and the rest of the Bat-Family. Catwoman embarked on a new venture to save Gotham by training low-level criminals to become skilled cat burglars like her, an effort that's seen a sizable reduction in crime. However, Batman vehemently opposed the plan, sending him on a crusade to dismantle Selina's operation. As the war in Gotham intensified, Batman became more brutal taking down Catwoman's operatives and Bruce's closest allies as he's been egged on by his dark backup personality, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\nHearing the vow Nightwing swore so long ago once again is a painful sign of just how messed up things are right now in the Bat-Family. Batman is seriously unwell and doing things that he ordinarily never world. Batman gave Nightwing access to Bruce's remote system because he knew he could trust Dick to stop him if Batman ever went too far. Nightwing takes his vow as seriously as he did the first day he said it and he's willing to do whatever it takes to stop Bruce. Even if that means fracturing his relationship with his old mentor for good.\nWhen Nightwing was brought in as Batman's sidekick, he promised that he would fight against crime and corruption. It's only fitting that the code that allows Dick access to Batman's system is the same vow he said as a child. Right now, something is corrupting the Dark Knight, and Dick has to do whatever he can to stop him. Nightwing and his family are at a major crossroads as Batman starts losing himself to his backup persona. The vow isn't just an apropos passphrase, it's a somber reminder that if Nightwing has to, he has no choice but to take down Batman for his crimes. Batman #138 is on sale now.\n"}
{"title": "10 Unanswered Questions About The World Of John Wick After Its Prequel", "date": "2023-10-09 00:50:27", "text": "The Continental prequel series promised to explain the origins of the famous assassin hotel. It only made the John Wick Universe more mysterious.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for The Continental!\nFans hoping to learn more about the John Wick Universe might be upset about the amount of unanswered questions surrounding its world-building after The Continental: From the World of John Wick. The prequel series followed a young Winston Scott as he battled nefarious kingpin Cormac (Mel Gibson) for control of the New York Continental Hotel, but even after proving victorious, Winston was just at the beginning of his immersion in the world-building that has made the John Wick films so distinct and beloved. While it was fun to see how he met Charon and why he wore an ascot, fans wanted more from his origin story.\nIf The Continental season 2 happens, it's possible that many of these questions will be answered. After all, there are decades left to Winston's reign as The Manager of the most powerful of all the assassin hotels, and he has only begun to understand the machinations of the High Table and the cohort of assassins he finds himself controlling. There are endless opportunities for more stories in the John Wick Universe after The Continental's ending, so things like the ascension of Laurence Fishburne's Bowery King, and the implications of possessing the coin press might still be answered.\nDuring the events of The Continental Mazie is the Bowery Queen, changing the Bowery King's origins in the John Wick films where he's played by Laurence Fishburne opposite Ian McShane's Winston. McShane is 20 years Fishburne's senior, but in the films it seems Fishburne was aged up so they could be contemporaries. McShane is also 20 years older than Lance Reddick who plays Charon as an adult, so it's possible that if Fishburne's Bowery King is active during The Continental he's a teenager, or Mazie's son, actively trained as her second-in-commad, to inherit the Soup Kitchen and its network of spies if the High Table orders her extermination.\nThe Adjudicator implies that she had something to do with Frankie stealing the coin press, perhaps out of her own mysterious motivations or to get rid of Cormac's means of control. As an Adjudicator, her role is to determine whether matters are being handled in accordance to the High Table's rules and if not, arbitrate and decide punishment. Winston killing her is an act of defiance against an organization he has only begun to understand as someone outside its paradigm, but with the coin in his possession, and the ability to leverage both Cormac's death and a rogue Adjudicator's, he may not face the same consequences.\nAt the end of The Continental, it's clear that the coin press hidden in the Scott family car was transferred to the bank Winston purchased for the Bowery. If the Bowery was able to keep ahold of it for the next 40 years, they would have the means to control the flow of commerce — that is, social relationships — in the criminal underworld. While it's clear that Fishburne's Bowery King is able to operate independently of the High Table, it's not so clear how he accomplishes this, but perhaps because he has the ability to flood the market with gold coins that would render the High Table's control useless.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick travels to Morroco and visits one of the High Table's mints where the distinct gold coins are made and stored before going into circulation among his cohort of assassins. It's possible that Cormac, obtaining so much influence at the New York Continental with the coin press, necessitated such an infrastructure eventually, though it seems like an organization that predates the Roman Empire would have already been in place. Clearly, the High Table needed to take countermeasures against anyone who would seek to duplicate Cormac's plan.\nLike John Wick, Winston also bears the mark of the Ruska Roma as seen in John Wick: Chapter 4, the assassin clan that took in a young John Wick after his parents died. He didn't have it in The Continental, which only told the story of his very beginnings with the High Table and the world of John Wick. After learning the ropes, it's possible that he met The Director (Anjelica Huston) and chose to join the Ruska Roma himself, perhaps even sponsoring John's membership when he found him. It only makes sense that Winston would have pledged himself to a clan in order to avail himself of its resources.\nThere are certain characters in The Continental that don't appear in the John Wick movies, such as KD, Lou, Yen, and much of the core cast. Some of these characters, like gentlemanly sharpshooter Jenkins, had probably passed away by the time John Wick was carrying out his vendetta, but many of the other members of the cast would have been Winston's age, but they're mysteriously absent except for Charon and Uncle Charlie. It's possible that they were killed, ran afoul of the High Table or, if they were fortunate, managed to get out of the lifestyle and not become entangled in its politics.\nThe assassins in The Continental look and behave like supervillains. From The Twins to the assassin with a skeleton face mask, wrist cuffs, and a machete, they're not exactly the sleek, suit-wearing assassins that appear in the John Wick films. There's a scene where Winston gifts the Bowery suits in order for its operatives to infiltrate the hotel, but they stand apart from the crossbow-wielding characters running maniacally down the halls like comic book characters. Perhaps a more unified aesthetic came with time, and Winston had a hand in cultivating the ethos behind \"the suit maketh the man.\"\nViolence occurs on Continental grounds continuously in the John Wick prequel, with only a red light and a voice declaring, \"Incident on Continental Grounds\" to indicate a problem. The fact that Winston steps off the stoop in order to legally shoot The Adjudicator means nothing given the mayhem that occurred inside. The Continental chain has always been a safe haven in the John Wick films, to the point where John's abuse of it ignites an international incident, but the rules are very poorly defined in The Continental show.\nFrankie told Winston that he stole the coin press on behalf of Nihilus/The Nile, but this organization is never mentioned again. It's possible that this is an assassin clan much like the Ruska Roma, or connected in some way, but it's something that's never fleshed out. There are numerous assassin clans in the John Wick movies, and some have intriguing titles while ethnic groups simply bring together others. It's also possible that Frankie was lying, but it seems like something that would become important in The Continental 2.\nLemmy comes across one single operator in The Continental but the John Wick films show dozens of them processing assassination contracts. The most important assassin hotel in the world only has one operator, which implies that the assassination field grew exponentially in the intervening decades, necessitating a huge hiring initiative. But the series doesn't show a sense of scale, or how the High Table is an internationally recognized organization, resulting in The Continental: From the World of John Wick seem very small and self-contained in comparison to the John Wick films.\n"}
{"title": "Every Adventure Time Character Who Appears In Fionna & Cake", "date": "2023-10-09 00:40:27", "text": "The Adventure Time spinoff Fionna & Cake features several fan-favorite Adventure Time characters — and a few less-than-optimal antagonists.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake.\nThe Max spinoff Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake features several of the original Adventure Time characters — and a few antagonists too. Fionna, a human who's sick of dead-end jobs in her magic-less world, ends up in the Land of Ooo with her pal Cake the Cat. The spinoff's titular characters, who are alternate versions of Adventure Time's protagonists Finn the Human and Jake the Dog, then join Simon Petrikov (a.k.a. Ice King) on a multiverse-traversing journey.\nWhile Fionna and Cake's place in Adventure Time’s timeline is a bit complicated, it has its roots in the original series. In Adventure Time season 3, Finn and Jake are subjected to Ice King's poorly disguised fan fiction, which centers on Fionna and Cake. The Max miniseries stems from this story-within-a-story, but, thanks to an entity called Prismo, canonizes Fionna and Cake and establishes their universe as one that was secretly hidden within Ice King's mind (hence the fan fiction). The journey Simon, Fionna, and Cake embark on sees the characters confronting their pasts in order to accept their futures, and, along the way, the trio encounters more than a few familiar faces.\nOne of the main characters of Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake, Simon Petrikov is still tormented by his past as the Ice King. Feeling isolated and like a relic of the past, Simon tries to resurrect his late fiancée, Betty. Instead, he opens a portal in the back of his head, allowing Cake to emerge in the Land of Ooo. A few episodes later, Simon is responsible for bringing Fionna to Ooo as well. In an attempt to reconcile their pasts and futures, the trio embark on a cosmic, multiverse-hopping quest. Given how much Simon's story figures into the larger Adventure Time canon, it's great to see him serving such an important role in the spinoff.\nThe creators of Fionna and Cake were keen on making Fionna distinct from Finn. In order to give more weight to her multiverse adventures, the team cut down Finn's screen time. In the second episode of the Adventure Time spinoff, Simon goes on a brief quest with adult Finn, who's bulked up and grown a long beard. Later, in another universe, viewers get a glimpse of Farmworld Finn, a character who stems from the original series. Unfortunately, the Distant Lands miniseries confirmed that Jake is dead in Fionna and Cake, hence adult Finn's homage-paying chest tattoo.\nIn Fionna and Cake episode 8, the talking cat finds another fan-favorite character: BMO. A living prototype video game console, BMO lives alone in a desolate land stretch of land but proves to be a trusty sidekick when called upon. While BMO tries to help the trio gain more insight into Ice King's madness, their spinoff role is short-lived. Even so, it's a treat to see BMO adventuring through the Land of Ooo once more.\nIn the sixth episode of the miniseries, Simon works with the Winter King, an alternate version of Simon's Ice King persona who was able to escape the Ice Crown's curse. Together, the duo try to replicate Winter King's crown, but they're soon kidnapped by Candy Queen. In a fun role reversal, the unhinged, villainous Candy Queen is actually an alternate version of Princess Bubblegum who was corrupted by the crown's curse. By the episode's end, Fionna destroys the crown, which saves this alt-PB from madness.\nRELATED: Adventure Time's Distant Lands: Obsidian Fixed A Huge Problem\nIn Fionna and Cake's vampire timeline, Simon dies, which means he isn't around to protect and raise a young Marceline. Instead, the half-demon is adopted by the menacing Vampire King, which causes Marcy to grow into a ruthless, power-hungry vampire known as The Star. Bent on destroying humanity's remaining survivors, The Star delights in killing, making her a much darker version of Adventure Time's Marceline the Vampire Queen.\nA human-turned-wizard, Betty was Simon's fiancée before he became Adventure Time's villainous yet bumbling Ice King. In Adventure Time's series finale, Betty sacrifices herself to protect Simon and fuses with a malevolent entity called GOLB (more on that later). In Fionna and Cake, a lonely Simon tries to resurrect his lost love and shares his past with Fionna. Ultimately, Simon comes to learn more about the magnitude of Betty's sacrifice, which helps him more readily accept his present.\nKnown as The Wishmaster, Prismo is \"a manifestation of an old man's dream.\" The cosmic entity resides in the Time Room, which itself exists at the center of Adventure Time's multiverse. In the episode \"Wake Up,\" it's revealed that he's a sleeping old man's dream projection and that his almighty existence is tied to the mortal's slumber. Disillusioned with his job, especially after Jake's death, Prismo secretly creates Fionna and Cake's universe and hides it inside Ice King's mind — which draws the attention of his enemy, Scarab the God Auditor.\nRELATED: Adventure Time: 15 Best Episodes Of The Series Ranked\nThe embodiment of chaos and disorder, GOLB is the Adventure Time franchise's big bad. The cosmic, malevolent entity eventually comes to the Land of Ooo in Adventure Time's final season and is only defeated by Betty, who fuses with it. In Fionna and Cake, GOLBetty plays a small role. For starters, The Lich, a death-dealing cosmic entity and Adventure Time antagonist, now prays to GOLBetty. However, the character's more significant role comes into play when Simon apologizes for allowing Betty to continually sacrifice her happiness and agency for him.\nDescribed by Adventure Time's canon as \"an ancient cosmic being as the manifestation of death,\" The Lich is a continual thorn in Finn and Jake's sides. In Fionna and Cake episode 8, \"Jerry,\" the character comes into play after the trio seeks out BMO's pal, the eponymous Jerry. Ultimately, it's revealed that Jerry is actually the Lich.\nRELATED: Adventure Time: 13 Times The Quirky Cartoon Actually Was Scary\nIf Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake returns for a second season, it might feature more of Beth and Shermy, a somewhat mysterious duo who were first introduced in the Adventure Time series finale. The spiritual stand-ins for Finn and Jake, Beth and Shermy live in an even more dystopian Land of Ooo, roughly 1,000 years after the events of Adventure Time, though Fionna and Cake episode 7 gives viewers a brief glimpse into their plans to take down antagonist called Gibbon. Later, in episode 9, GOLB transports Simon's mind into that of Shermy, allowing Simon to gain some important insight by visiting a library of the future.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

{"title": "Ellen Burstyn Was &quot;Very Skeptical&quot; Of The Exorcist: Believer Before Agreeing To Join Sequel", "date": "2023-10-09 00:37:22", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer director David Gordon Green reveals that Ellen Burstyn was skeptical of the sequel, and it took some time to get her onboard.\nThe Exorcist: Believer director David Gordon Green reveals that Ellen Burstyn was initially reluctant to join the project. The new movie serves as a direct sequel to the original 1973 film, The Exorcist. Believer succeeded in doing what no other installments in the franchise could: Getting Burstyn to reprise her role as Chris MacNeil for the first time since 1973. Burstyn earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as MacNeil in The Exorcist, a mother whose daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), shows signs of demonic possession. However, she has been reluctant to dive back into the franchise.\nIn an interview with A.Frame, Green confirmed that it was no easy feat getting Burstyn onboard for The Exorcist: Believer. The first time he approached her, she shot down the idea of being a part of the cast. Over time, though, Green was able to win her over. Check out his statement below:\nI could have done it without her, but it's a big relief, as someone trying to honor the original film, to have someone I'm not exactly looking for permission but who can hold my hand as I step into sacred territory. If there's any hand I want to hold here, it's Ellen Burstyn's. At first, she was very skeptical. Her immediate answer was, \"Hell no.\" I think people have approached her many times about sequels, so I said, 'If you won't be in my movie, at least be my friend.'\nWe ended up talking about my intentions and the story I'm trying to tell, how I want to go about it, and how I can make this meaningful to me, personally. I start every project very self-indulgently. I want this to be a movie for me. I can acknowledge that there is a significant fan base, but I can't give it the tools I have unless I know that the movie needs me, and I need it. Ellen and I spoke and shared literature and philosophies and had a few social conversations. When I then sent her the script, I think she was probably, in my eyes, pleasantly surprised that I'd incorporated some of the conversations that we had, that I'd personalized it for her and taken great lengths to pay respect to the Chris MacNeil character 50 years later. We had a tremendous collaboration, and I'm very proud to have worked with her.\nNow that The Exorcist: Believer has premiered and reviews have started flowing in, there is the question of if Burstyn made the right call to re-enter the franchise with this movie. Unfortunately, The Exorcist: Believer hasn't managed to differentiate itself from other installments in the franchise in terms of reception. As of this writing, its Rotten Tomatoes score stands at just 23%, making it the third lowest-rated movie in the series. While it hasn't done terribly at the box office, its opening weekend was slightly less than predictions estimated.\nAt the same time, Green's statement indicates that prospects of success didn't lead to Burstyn's decision to return. Instead, her main concern was that The Exorcist: Believer respected the original movie. Not only have other films in the franchise been ill-received, but some haven't respected the source material at all. For example, Exorcist II: The Heretic was directed by someone who despised the original movie and the novel it was based on, trying to take the franchise in a new direction with terrible results. Considering this, it's not surprising that she appreciated how much Green valued her opinion.\nWhile critics had negative things to say about The Exorcist: Believer, one thing they couldn't accuse it of is desecrating the franchise's legacy. Many singled out The Exorcist: Believer's respect for the franchise and desire to return to its roots as one of the few positive aspects. Though some felt that the movie wasted Burstyn, others felt her presence helped drive home its purpose of paying tribute to the original. Ultimately, The Exorcist: Believer isn't perfect, but the quality may not have mattered as much to the original star as knowing her opinions and role in the franchise were valued.\nSource: A.frame\n"}

In the past few decades, horror parodies have increased in popularity. Shaun of the Dead is a popular twist on the Dawn of the Dead franchise from the early aughts. More recently, Freaky – a horror spin on Freaky Friday – and Happy Death Day – a scary version of Groundhog’s Day – have graced the screens. This holiday season will add another fun horror movie to the mix.\nOn October 5, It’s a Wonderful Knife’s trailer dropped, creating hype for the upcoming movie horror twist on the holiday film It’s a Wonderful Life. The preview includes multiple exciting elements like a person’s wish that they hadn’t been born, lots of blood, and a fast-paced plot. Additionally, there’s a scary slasher villain called the Angel. When unmasked, the preview shows a familiar face – that of actor Justin Long. It’s a Wonderful Knife proves that Justin Long deserves to be recognized as the horror king he is.\nMultiple famous actors started out in horror flicks, and Justin Long is no exception. Two years after his first on-screen appearance, Long starred as Darry in Jeepers Creepers, reprising his role in the second film too. These aren’t the only horror films he’s appeared in though, as the list of Justing Long horror movies is quite large. In the cult classic animated horror movie Hair High, Long voiced a teenager named Dwayne. He also appeared as Clay Dalton in Drag Me to Hell, Wallace Bryton in Tusk, and Hap Jackson in House of Darkness. His most recent horror movie is the 2022 horror mystery film Barbarian, though he has three more in post-production.\nRelated: 15 Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nIn addition to his film work, Justin Long has appeared in two horror TV series. Long played a one-off role in Creepshow, season 2, episode 5, “Night of the Living Late Show.” In this episode, he plays Simon Sherman, a man trying to escape from his marriage by creating a VR system that causes a person to experience anything that happens in the virtual world. Additionally, Long is a series regular in Disney Plus’s reboot of Goosebumps, where he plays a teacher with a connection to supernatural murders that occurred decades earlier.\nIn Justin Long's recent years, he's taken to acting as villains in horror media. In Disney Plus’s reboot of Goosebumps, Long plays Nathan Bratt, the teacher who becomes the antagonist after his body gets possessed by an evil spirit. Throughout Barbarian, his character AJ Gilbride acts in his own self-interest, even pushing Tess off the water tower after she comes back to save him. Taking these roles into consideration, it’s fitting that Justin Long plays the killer in It’s a Wonderful Knife. He is well practiced at making his mannerisms and face menacing, turning himself into a convincing bad guy for a horror movie.\n"}
{"title": "Red Hood's Custom Bullets Just Gave Him a Cooler Version of the Dark Knight's Utility Belt", "date": "2023-10-09 00:30:25", "text": "Red Hood has always struggled to find his place in the DC Universe, but one cool new gadget might just prove where Jason Todd truly belongs.\nWarning! Contains Spoilers For DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1!\nIt's no secret that DC has been struggling to find the right path for Red Hood, but the answer may have just come from this year's Halloween special — which reveals that Jason has an even cooler version of Batman's iconic utility belt. Jason's unique new weapons show the exact niche that Red Hood belongs in DC lore: fighting the supernatural.\nDC annual October tradition of releasing something extra spooky continues this year in a large anthology of horror stories: DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1. One stand-out story, \"The Dark Bite\" by Christopher Sean, Laneya, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott, features Nightwing dealing with vampires in Bludhaven. He calls in backup in the form of Red Hood, who shows up on the scene and proves to be surprisingly effective at fighting the supernatural.\nRed Hood reveals that he created antidotes for each supernatural threat he expected to face, including vampires, werewolves, and demons. Each antidote comes in a special dart designed for his guns. This level of preparedness for fighting the supernatural shows exactly where Jason Todd belongs in the DC Universe.\nRelated: Red Hood Isn't Actually Human - Official DC Theory Explained\nAs the second Robin, Jason Todd had big shoes to fill by following in the steps of Dick Grayson. In fact, when Jason was first introduced, he was a near carbon copy of Dick. Over time and after a Crisis event, Jason became his own character — especially after Jason was killed off by the Joker. When he returned, nearly two decades later, it was as the brutal vigilante Red Hood. Jason was now posed as an enemy to the Bat-Family, but this status quo didn't last long either. He eventually rejoined Batman's allies, albeit with some disagreements over how to handle criminals. This has led to DC's struggle in finding a place for Jacon in the central DCU, but this Halloween special shows that Jason's perfect place has always been with the supernatural.\nExcept for Damian Wayne, Jason coming back from the dead is something almost no other Bat-Family member has done. When Damian was killed and returned to life, he had short after-effects of Kryptonian-like powers, so it's fair to assume that Jason might have some after-effects as well. It's possible that Jason's revival has made him more in tune with the supernatural. Batman does everything he can to fight criminals and protect the living, but there are a lot of people who have already been murdered, and whose crimes go unsolved. Jason could step in and use his connection to the supernatural to help solve them\nJason shows in this issue that he has specialized equipment to take on demons, vampires, and werewolves. While Batman has shown impressive equipment to take down vampires, he rarely has to employ them. Giving Jason run of the supernatural corner of DC would finally give him a place to belong. Several different alternate universe stories have embraced Jason's connection to magic and the supernatural, such as the video game Gotham Knights, which leaned heavily into Jason having mystical abilities. In DCeased: Dead Planet Jason was the leader of Shadowpact, a vigilante group that specifically deals with magic and the supernatural. All of this proves that Red Hood has a place in the DC Universe — DC just has to let him take it.\nDC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1 is out now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "10 Burning Questions Barbie 2 Must Answer", "date": "2023-10-09 00:20:26", "text": "From what Barbie’s life will be like in the real world to what happens to Ken and Barbieland, here are 10 burning questions Barbie 2 can answer.\nIf Barbie 2 happens, it will have to answer some burning questions regarding the events of Barbie. Greta Gerwig's Barbie achieved incredible success, having taken more than 1.4 billion dollars at the global box office, so it makes sense for Warner Bros to follow it up with a sequel. At present, there has not been a confirmation of Barbie 2. However, considering the success of the movie, a sequel happening seems more likely than not.\nHowever, a sequel needs to do more than just drive sales for the studios, it needs to continue the story established in Barbie and revisit some key moments. The movie ends with Robbie's Barbie now a part of the real world, arriving at her first-ever gynecology appointment, which confirms that she became human. There is also a shroud of mystery about what happened to everyone else in Barbie Land and the effect that this connection between the real world and Barbie Land had on both. Here are some of the questions that need to be answered in a potential Barbie 2 story.\nThe Barbie movie ending revealed that Barbie returned to the real world and was cared for by Gloria's family. After they drop her off at a doctor's appointment, she steps up to the reception desk and with a great deal of excitement announces her reason for being there is that she has her first gynecology appointment. This is a clear indication that Barbie is no longer a doll, as earlier in the film she notes that everyone in Barbie Land doesn't have reproductive organs. But it isn't just leaving Barbie Land that transformed her, as she clarifies that she and Ken were still without reproductive organs when they first entered the real world.\nBarbie is used to a simple life where most things tend to come easy. The real world tends to be full of contradictions and complications, so how has she gotten used to life outside of Barbie Land is an important question. Her first introduction to the real world was a confusing and challenging time for her but hopefully, with the help and guidance of Gloria and her daughter Sasha, Barbie is assimilating well. Barbie 2 could explore her getting used to a new way of living and fitting into the wider world.\nThe balance in Barbie Land is clearly pretty fragile. In almost no time at all, Ken returned to Barbie Land with basic knowledge about what patriarchy was and decided to turn Barbie Land from a peaceful utopia into a teenage boy's dream full of horses, cars, and parties. The Barbies managed to restore the natural order and regain control, but with new complex notions about power struggles and a greater sense of autonomy, how is Barbie Land coping is a mystery. Are the Ken's happy to return to their lives as background characters, or has the landscape shifted and both sides looking at how to further improve their society together?\nWill Ferrel is hilarious in Barbie as the CEO of Mattel, but Barbie raised a serious concern by asking where the women were in the boardroom. Gloria was already working for Mattel, and now that Barbie has joined the real world, there are two perfectly capable candidates to help provide a female perspective and connect with the customers of Mattel should they be looking for a more diverse boardroom. Barbie 2 could explore the shift in power at Mattel and how the company seeks to further represent and reflect its customer base in its leadership team.\nBarbie Land is a beautiful landscape of pink, with houses spaced evenly apart and all positioned on uniform streets next to each other. But one big concern was raised during the Ken uprising, where do the Ken's actually live? When the Kens decided to take control of Barbie Land and occupy the Barbie dream houses for themselves, the Barbies asked where they were supposed to live, and no one had any answer. Obviously, the Ken's should not have stolen the Barbie's homes, but where is it that they live and sleep wasn't answered. A sequel could go a long way to explaining where the Kens all go when Barbies aren't around.\nRelated: The Barbie Movie Cast & Character Guide\nKen's entire arc in Barbie was trying to understand who he was without Barbie. As a character, Ken was created as an accessory to Barbie, and so he formed much of his identity around her, but when Barbie decides to leave Barbie Land behind, Ken decides to take some time to work on himself and get a better understanding of who he really is. Outside his job, beach, what does Ken do, what does he like, and where does he sleep? All of these questions and more could be explored in a sequel where Ken has had some time for introspective thought.\nAllan is Ken's best friend in Barbie, and during the Ken uprising, Allan seems a little bit lost possessing no strong desire to take over Barbie Land and disturb the natural order. When the Barbies plan to reclaim their homes and remove Kens from power, Allan joins them and helps to restore Barbie Land to its original glory. As a singular anomaly in Barbie, Ken is unique and separate from the other Kens and Barbies, raising the question of what happens to him after the events of Barbie. Played by the beloved Michael Cera, seeing more of Allan and learning what happens to him next is a must for any future sequel.\nBarbie is a central figure in Barbie Land as Stereotypical Barbie. Her home is in a central position, and she has a great deal of influence over her peers. So what happens to Barbie Land after Stereotypical Barbie moves out? There would be an empty home in the center of the street, and Barbie's home was frequently the site of parties and gatherings with the rest of her friends. Finding out what actually happens to Barbie Land would be an important part of the story to develop in Barbie 2.\nIt's revealed early on in Barbie that Margot Robbie's character is connected to a woman in the real world who played with her as a doll. In addition, Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie is also shown being played with as a doll in the real world. Considering these connections to people in the real world and Robbie revealing that it is possible to go and seek out their owners, do any of the other Barbies decide to go off in search of their owners? This could be a fascinating development for a sequel to explore. And Robbie could provide help to her friends to transition and adapt to the real world considering her pioneering journey.\nFinally, now that Barbie is outside of Barbie Land, what does she do with all her free time is a major question. She clearly hangs out with Gloria and her family, but it would make sense for her to pursue her own independence with the chance to work and live on her own. To do that, she needs to find a way to earn money and adjust to everyday life eating real food and getting groceries. Barie could have landed a job at Mattel working with her friend Gloria, but she could also pursue other careers to get more experience of what it's like to be a real person. Barbie 2 could see her pursue a way to fit into regular life, potentially studying or working.\n"}
{"title": "Disney Once Had A Horror Movie Banned For Being Too Dark", "date": "2023-10-09 00:10:27", "text": "One Disney horror movie, which is now considered one of the most important animated films of all time, was once banned for being too dark.\nWalt Disney Studios has released some successful horror films, but in 1929, one horror movie was banned for being too dark for audiences. Disney's animated short The Skeleton Dance is one of the most essential animated shorts in cinematic history; it brought animation out of the silent era and was one of the first cartoons released in the golden age of animation between 1928 and 1969. However, the circumstances of its release were quite unique, especially compared to other Disney features and short films.\nThe Skeleton Dance was the first of Walt Disney's famous Silly Symphonies series of animated shorts. It was produced and directed by Walt Disney, animated by Ub Iwerks, and its score was composed by Carl W. Stalling. As implied by the title, the short 5-minute film depicts four skeletons rising from the grave and dancing, playing music, and causing havoc in the dead of night. Despite the cartoon's success, it was clear that its dark story and eerie animation didn't agree with everybody during its initial release, although it is one of the most important Disney animated movies.\nThe Skeleton Dance was the first of three horror-themed shorts that was released by Disney in 1929. Disney created this short, along with Hell's Bells and The Haunted House to show that they could tackle the horror genre efficiently through animation. The Skeleton Dance was one of the first films to use medieval dance macabre imagery; the four skeletons in the short, dance together, frighten animals and cause chaos before returning to the grave. Some felt the short was too frightening in nature, and it led to the cartoon being banned from viewing in Denmark due to its dark story and design.\nRelated: Disney's Upcoming Movie Releases - From 2023 To 2025\nIn 1930, The New York Times reported that Denmark had banned The Skeleton Dance entirely for being \"too macabre\" for audiences. There was concern that the black-and-white animation combined with the intense music was too graphic and frightening for its target audience at the time. Since the cartoon's release, the ban in Denmark has been lifted and Disney has continued to expand their work in the horror genre following the short's initial release.\nSince its release in 1929, The Skeleton Dance is considered an animated masterpiece, as it was one of the first cartoons to perfectly synchronize the animation and the sound together at the same time. Up until then, cartoons were created first and the sound was added later. It remains an important aspect of animated history and has influenced several horror cartoons in later years. While Disney received praise for the animation and the production of the cartoon, there was also criticism for its dark theme.\nRelated: All 27 Pixar Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\nIn July 1929, Variety magazine posted a review warning parents not to bring their children to watch The Skeleton Dance. They deemed that some scenes, such as where the four skeletons use their bones as instruments and scare owls and cats, were too dark for young audiences. Critics also pointed out that the musical accompaniment and the graveyard setting of the cartoon proved too gruesome for children to watch. Nevertheless, despite the controversy at the time, The Skeleton Dance proved monumental for the production of Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies and is still regarded as an animated classic horror movie today.\nEidhne Gallagher is a Movie and TV Features Writer, living in Ireland.

{"title": "Darth Vader Names the 1 Person He Hates Most in the Galaxy (& It's Not Obi-Wan)", "date": "2023-10-09 00:01:26", "text": "Darth Vader hates Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars lore, a hatred that's matched only by that of himself, yet there still exists one person he hates more. \nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars: Darth Vader #39 There are few people in the Star Wars galaxy Darth Vader hates more than Obi-Wan Kenobi, even if that hatred does stem from blinding self-loathing and misdirected sorrow. However, there is one other person who Darth Vader hates even more than his former master - and no, it isn’t himself.\nEven before he fell to the dark side, Anakin Skywalker always held resentment for Obi-Wan. Episode II highlights this probably the best out of any film or show set in that time period, with Anakin telling Padmé how Obi-Wan doesn’t trust him, how he’s holding him back, and even how Obi-Wan is ‘jealous’ of his power. This resentment culminated in the epic climax of the entire prequel trilogy, with Anakin and Obi-Wan’s fateful battle on Mustafar in Episode III. Then, Vader’s hatred for Obi-Wan was solidified before their final encounter in Episode IV during the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, during Vader’s latest mission in Star Wars canon, he’s forced to dig deep within himself to unlock a hatred the likes of which he’d rarely felt before for the sake of his own survival, and the person he focused on wasn’t Obi-Wan Kenobi or even himself, it was Emperor Palpatine.\nIn Star Wars: Darth Vader #39 by Greg Pak and Raffaele Ienco, Darth Vader overcomes his tenuous grasp on the Force to destroy a portion of the Scourge that was inhabiting a deadly Clone Wars-era droid that never saw mass production. To do that, Darth Vader had to focus on his blinding hatred, and really pinpoint the thing he truly hated most in the galaxy. His mind glided over a number of qualified individuals, including Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and himself. However, by the end of the issue, it’s strongly implied that the true source of Darth Vader’s hatred was Palpatine, and he used that hatred to crush this Scourge-host with the clenching of his fist. This point is then driven home further, as Darth Vader is now on his way to Coruscant to challenge Palpatine face-to-face.\nIt is true that Darth Vader has admitted on more than one occasion that he hates himself more than anyone else, with one example seen in the Star Wars Tales #9 story “Resurrection” during his fight with Darth Maul. However, based on his entire Star Wars character arc, it makes way more sense that Vader actually hates Palpatine the most. By hating the Emperor, Darth Vader has given Palpatine dominion over him, as hatred is the source of dark side power. Plus, every bad thing that’s ever happened in Vader’s life is because of Palpatine, and while Anakin Skywalker was originally ignorant to that fact (and even blamed Obi-Wan instead), Darth Vader certainly was not. This is why Vader was able to find redemption after killing Palpatine in Episode VI, as doing so was a physical action representing the metaphorical destruction of Vader’s evil self, and his acceptance of the light side through the love he had for his son.\nThis isn’t to say Darth Vader doesn’t have intense hatred for Obi-Wan as well as immense self-loathing, as he unarguably does. However, when it comes to who Darth Vader hates more than anyone in the Star Wars galaxy, himself and Obi-Wan Kenobi don’t hold a candle to the true point of Darth Vader’s hatred, Emperor Palpatine.\nStar Wars: Darth Vader #39 by Marvel Comics is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.
