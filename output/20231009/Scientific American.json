{"title": "This Indigenous Community Records the Climate Change That Is Causing Their Town to Erode Away", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:00", "text": "In a tiny village north of the Arctic Circle in Canada, the Inuvialuit of Tuktoyaktuk have taken climate science into their own hands. \nJocie Bentley: So what’s behind you right now?\nWilliam Dillon, Jr.: What’s behind me? It’s all our old grounds for our garage. It will be falling into the ocean probably next year. It lost five feet this year of ground, fell in. Yeah, lost five feet.\nBentley: I’m in Tuktoyaktuk, a.k.a., Tuk. It’s a tiny village 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in the Northwest Territories in Canada.\nI’m talking to William Dillon, Jr., aka Billy. He’s a respected elder in the Inuvialuit community that lives here—and also the sweetest guy. Within minutes of meeting us, he made us delicious smoked tea, and now he’s giving us a tour.\nBut it’s a tour of what used to be.\nDillon: And, uh, our old school and old folks’ home is next to go. And our graveyard, we’ve moved our graveyard already, but we haven’t moved the people in the graveyard yet.\nBentley: His community is being taken back by the ocean in real time. But he’s not just watching it happen. He’s documenting it scientifically.\nDillon: It’s just basically recording, recording, recording, and monitoring and just make sure that everybody’s aware of how fast it is melting.\nBentley: I’m Joc Bentley, and this is part two of our three-part Science, Quickly Fascination from a fast-warming Arctic. In today’s episode, I’m riding with Inuvialuit climate monitors. These inspiring locals are taking charge and are measuring climate change in real time. We’re on a boat to Tuk Island, a small but extremely important barrier that’s protecting the village’s harbor. But it’s disappearing.\nDillon: Yeah, basically, if we lose this island, we lose the harbor. The harbor will be too exposed to the Arctic Ocean elements. Yeah, this is our safety barrier island. Nice name, safety barrier.\nJames Keevik: It’ll be gone in 20 years, though, no matter what.\nDillon: Yeah.\nBentley: That was James Keevik talking to Billy, by the way. They’re part of this new citizen      science team. And I asked them ...\nBentley (tape): So what’s happening to the island?\nDillon: It’s eroding with all this new climate change we’re [seeing] happening here. In fall time, we see more erosion than ever before. Like, for now, we’re having a hard time landing our boat here, ’cause the erosion has filled in all this area with sediment. You know, we just, we have to keep aware. Our hunting and traveling, have to keep aware all the time. And nothing is the same anymore.\nShallow all over here, too, James.\nBentley: James and Billy work their magic, and we finally get off the boat and onto the island. Eriel Lugt, the team’s coordinator, is directing the data collection.\nEriel Lugt: We have stakes already in the spots, and we’re going to measure the distance from the stakes.\nBentley: These stakes are a reference point so the team can accurately measure erosion on each side.\nDillon: We centimeters or feet?\nKeevik: Inches.\nDillon: Inches. Ooh, I’m reading nine feet, nine and a quarter.\nBentley: Eriel is only in high school, but she’s already been asked to speak all over the world about what’s happening up here.\nLugt: Uh, we have, like, four climate monitors. Yeah, any local Inuvialuit could be a climate monitor. Right now we’re monitoring the erosion on this island. And the erosion will, like, wipe away our whole town if it keeps happening. This island is, like, a barrier from the ocean to the harbor. It’s really beautiful, and it’s very cultural. Uh, it’s kind of sad. I hope in the future we can find a solution.\nBentley: Hopefully these data can help to create a plan to save the island, save the harbor and save Tuk. Dustin Whalen is a physical scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada. He was here, setting up the program with Billy, Eriel and James, but I just missed him by a couple of weeks. So I gave him a call to chat about the North.\nWhalen: In the community of Tuk, you could argue this is the area in Canada where we see the most impact of climate change. Because of this, the citizens that live in this area want to take a stand. They want to understand what they’re seeing in their own backyard. So community-based monitoring, this idea for, you know, looking at some of the information, the climate information, on their own, taking the observations for themselves, looking at the science so they can be in charge, and they can be the stewards of their own data—this is what really spurred on this community-based monitoring program.\nBentley (tape): The erosion they’re measuring isn’t just a product of increased permafrost thaw, right? How does the reduction in ice coverage come into play?\nWhalen: Now you’re seeing a lot more storms because there’s more open water. As the wind kicks up, it increases the swell in the wave potential in the water, and then that grows, o bviously, if you have more distance between that than the coast—so when the storms reach the coast there, they’re a lot bigger than they were before.\nBentley (tape): What does this mean for the Inuvialuit living in Tuk?\nWhalen: I have learned through my career that the Indigenous peoples are very resilient, and they’re resilient to change. They have seen change over centuries of existing on this planet, and they have learned to adapt. So I have all the confidence in the world that the people living in the North will adapt to this change in some form or another. But I have less, less confidence that if the world is faced with the same changes that the Northerners are seeing, they may not be as resilient.\nBentley: Back in Tuk, Billy is hopeful for the future. I asked Billy what advice he had for the next generation.\nDillon: Keep hugging those trees, kids. Be helpful. Don’t litter, because this is the main problem we have all over the world, with litter. And be respectful to your elders, to your land and water, and be respectful to the air you breathe.

{"title": "Zoom Time May Be Linked to Discontent with One's Own Appearance", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nHow do people make peace with the image reflected back at them in a video conference?\nThe following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new era of digital connection: In the absence of in-person gatherings, many people instead found themselves face-to-face with their co-workers and loved ones on a screen.\nVideoconferencing has provided many benefits and conveniences. However, it isn’t surprising that constantly seeing ourselves on screens might come with some downsides as well.\nPrior to the pandemic, studies showed that surgeons were seeing increasing numbers of patients requesting alterations of their image to match filtered or doctored photos from social media apps. Now, several years into the pandemic, surgeons are seeing a new boom of cosmetic surgical requests related to videoconferencing. In one study of cosmetic procedures during the pandemic, 86% of cosmetic surgeons reported videoconferencing as the most common reason for cosmetic concerns among their patients.\nDespite the fact that many aspects of life have returned to some version of pre-pandemic normal, it’s clear that videoconferencing and social media will be with us for the foreseeable future. So what does that mean when it comes to appearance satisfaction and making peace with the image that’s reflected back at us?\nFor the past 10 years, I have worked as a specialist in obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders and anxiety. Since the pandemic, I, too, have seen increasing numbers of therapy clients reporting that they struggle with appearance concerns related to videochatting and social media.\nEvery person has perceptions and thoughts about their appearance. These can be neutral, negative or positive. We all look at ourselves in the mirror and may have even experienced distress while looking at our reflection.\nThere are a number of factors that may lead to appearance dissatisfaction. A preoccupation with thoughts, feelings or images of one’s own appearance is linked to the action of “mirror gazing,” or staring at one’s reflection. Researchers suggest that this type of selective self-focused attention and mirror gazing can lead to negative fixations on specific attributes or minor flaws, which in turn intensify the preoccupation with these attributes.\nOther factors that can contribute to appearance dissatisfaction include low self-esteem, societal beliefs around appearance, peer and parental influences, temperament and genetic predispositions to mental health conditions.\nAppearance dissatisfaction and negative evaluations of self are associated with depression, lower self-esteem, habitual negative thinking and increased social anxiety. What’s more, research suggests that these preoccupations can contribute to the development of eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors, such as frequently restricting food intake or exercising without refueling.\nWith the ubiquity of Zoom meetings, FaceTime calls, selfies and the constancy of documenting our lives on social media, access to our own image can often feel inescapable. And for some people, this can magnify feelings of appearance dissatisfaction that may have been more fleeting before the Zoom era.\nSince the pandemic, screen time has increased for both adults and children. What’s worse, recent research suggests that the video and photo reflections we see of ourselves are distorted.\nVideoconferencing, taking selfies and posting on social media are visually based activities where appearance is often the primary focus. All of them have in common the fact that a person’s image is either live or shared in an immediate manner. Perhaps not surprisingly, these image-based platforms have been significantly associated with appearance dissatisfaction, anxiety, depression and eating disorders.\nOne study found that those who engaged in more videochatting appearance comparisons, meaning those who looked at others’ appearance during a video call and sized up their own appearance in comparison, experienced lower appearance satisfaction. This study also found that people who used more photo-editing features on videochat platforms were more likely to compare themselves with others and spend more time looking at themselves on video calls.\nOne thing that is unique to videoconferencing is that it allows people to easily compare themselves with others and watch themselves sharing and speaking in real time. A 2023 study found that discomfort with one’s appearance during videoconferencing led to an increased fixation on appearance, which in turn led to impaired work performance.\nResearchers also suggest that appearance dissatisfaction is associated with virtual-meeting fatigue. The research reports that this could be due to negative self-focused attention, cognitive overload and anxiety around being stared at or being negatively evaluated based on appearance.\nThis last point is notable because of the difficulty videochatters have determining where other users are looking. Using the concept of the “spotlight effect” − our tendency as humans to overestimate how much others are judging our appearance − this difficulty may lead to more anxiety and individuals believing that others are evaluating their appearance during a video call.\nIf you find yourself criticizing your appearance every time you hop onto a videoconference call, it may be time to evaluate your relationship with your appearance and seek out help from a qualified therapist.\nHere are some questions to consider to help determine whether your thought patterns or behaviors are problematic:\nHow much of my day is spent thinking about my appearance?\nWhat sort of behaviors am I doing around my appearance?\nDo I feel distressed if I do not perform these behaviors?\nDoes this behavior align with my values and how I want to be spending my time?\nAnother strategy is to be intentional about focusing on what other people are saying in a videoconference instead of peering at your own face.\nWhen it comes to helping others who might be struggling with appearance dissatisfaction, it is important to focus on the person’s innate qualities beyond appearance. People should be conscious of their comments, no matter how well intentioned. Negative comments about appearance have been linked to worsened self-esteem and mental health. When viewing yourself or your peers on video and social media, try focusing on the person as a whole and not as parts of a body.\nReducing screen time can make a difference as well. Research shows that reducing social media use by 50% can improve appearance satisfaction in both teens and adults.\nWhen used in moderation, videoconferencing and social media are tools to connect us with others, which ultimately is a key piece in satisfaction and well-being.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"title": "The Flu Vaccine Works--In a Way Most People Don't Appreciate", "date": "2023-10-09 10:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThe CDC is emphasizing how the flu vaccine can turn the virus from “Wild to Mild”\nIt’s like clockwork: first comes a brisk fall breeze, then comes the public health push to get a flu shot. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s messaging this year might look a little different from previous vaccination seasons. The agency has launched a messaging campaign dubbed “Wild to Mild” that uses adorable critters to illustrate how a vaccine can tame a bout with the flu by reducing its strength from that of an elephant or a lion to that of a mouse or a kitten.\nThe framing might come as a surprise to those used to a blunter way of talking about vaccines: get vaccinated or get sick. But Wild to Mild is designed to be a more honest, nuanced portrayal of the benefits of the influenza vaccine, which scientists have long recognized is better at reducing serious infections than at preventing infection altogether.\n“We tend to take kind of a black-and-white approach to vaccines of ‘if you get vaccinated, it will keep you from getting that particular disease,’” says Sarah Bauerle Bass, a social and behavioral scientist at Temple University, who focuses on health and risk communication. “The pro is that it’s a very simple message; the con is that it doesn’t necessarily communicate the reality of vaccines, which is that sometimes you do get that disease even though you’re vaccinated.”\nThe amount of protection a vaccine offers depends on the disease it targets. For some shots, such as those for measles and polio, the black-and-white approach is essentially true, says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. If you received the standard vaccine regimen as a child, your odds of ever catching those particular diseases are tiny: around 1 percent for each.\nBut flu doesn’t work the same way. Measles and polio are static viruses, whereas influenza mutates regularly, allowing it to evade our immune system even if it’s been trained to identify the pathogen via prior infection or vaccination. In addition, influenza is a family of viruses, and typically the flu vaccine administered in the U.S. targets only four strains. These strains are selected based on the ones that are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere more than six months before flu season begins in the North. Selecting which strains to target is a guessing game—one that scientists can’t always win.\nThese factors give the influenza vaccine a spotty record in preventing disease—at least to an untrained eye. “During well-matched seasons, we see [risk reduction] numbers pretty consistently within the range of 40 to 60 percent” among the vaccinated, says Erin Burns, associate director of communications for the influenza division at the CDC. “I think the public perception, maybe, is that that is less than impressive.”\nThe perceived “low” protection can cause people to hesitate about receiving the vaccine. “There’s a very widely held perception that the flu vaccine doesn’t work,” she says. “People think that if they get vaccinated, and then they get sick, the vaccine has failed.”\nBut that’s not an accurate view of what public health experts expect the flu vaccine to accomplish, Schaffner says, adding that he’s been encouraging the messaging pivot for years now. Mild influenza occurs mostly in the respiratory tract, where vaccine-induced defenses aren’t as effective because they can’t reach the surface of the mucus membranes in, for example, your nose, he says. That’s where the virus might first enter your body and cause flu’s mild symptoms, such as a runny nose—so vaccination doesn’t do much against these infections.\nInstead the vaccine produces defenses that are active deeper in the body—in the heart, liver and kidney, for example—and can stop the virus from sneaking into organs, where it can cause a severe to possibly life-threatening infection. For the flu, vaccination isn’t about reducing infections overall but instead about reducing the hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths the disease causes in the U.S. each year.\nThe Wild to Mild campaign, Burns says, is designed to counter the idea that the flu vaccine doesn’t work and present a more accurate understanding of the shot’s purpose. “We were realizing that we needed to reset those expectations,” she says. She isn’t concerned that advertising the fact that the flu vaccine doesn’t offer total protection could reduce uptake because the perception of its failure is already so widespread.\nThe Wild to Mild approach also addresses another common misperception: that the flu isn’t a serious illness. CDC scientists are “emphasizing the severity of the disease without scaring people, and they’re empowering [people],” says Saad Omer, an epidemiologist and dean of the O’Donnell School of Public Health at the University of Texas Southwestern. “They’re saying, ‘It can be wild, but you can make it mild because you have the power to do that.’”\nHoward Markel, a physician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan, says he sees a dramatic shift in the way the public has come to think about vaccines in general. “If you grew up in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, vaccines were like a gift,” Markel says. Shots were also mostly for children then, he notes, unlike the modern flu vaccine, with its annual campaigns targeting all adults.\n\nNow public perception of vaccines in general is much more neutral—and, in some cases, deeply skeptical—and views are politically polarized. “Our tolerance is less, too, for any error [or] anything less than perfection in our science and medicine,” he says.\nMeanwhile the CDC has struggled to sell some Americans on COVID vaccines—particularly in the form of annual shots that are available each fall, like the flu vaccine is. Temple University’s Bass says that the COVID vaccine has suffered from the same perception of ineffectiveness as the flu vaccine for similar reasons.\nBurns says the Wild to Mild campaign came about independently from the agency’s COVID experience, although flu vaccine uptake rates have dipped slightly since the pandemic’s first winter. “People are still more open to flu vaccines than they are to COVID vaccines,” she says.\nStill, public health officials acknowledge that some people will never get the flu vaccine, and they are focusing on vaccine education that will help increase uptake among undecided people. “You go into these campaigns knowing that you’re never going to get 100 percent of people,” Bass says. “What you’re really aiming for is that large group in the middle who might, with either the right messaging or the right messengers, be more likely to do that.”\nIn that way, Wild to Mild is an uncanny embodiment of the flu vaccine itself, which can’t prevent all infections but can nonetheless reduce the disease’s impacts. “We can do a lot of good with this vaccine,” Schaffner says. “We can turn wild to mild while we’re waiting for the perfect science to give us the perfect flu vaccine. It’s not here yet. Let’s do the best we can with what we have today.”\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist and news reporter for Scientific American who is based in New York City.\nTara Haelle\nJim Daley\nFerris Jabr\nTanya Lewis\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Climate Disasters Displaced 43 Million Children in Just Six Years", "date": "2023-10-06 18:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThe Philippines, India and China have seen the greatest total number of children displaced by disasters—some 23 million—in recent years\nCLIMATEWIRE | Extreme weather events and climate disasters displaced more than 43 million children around the globe between 2016 and 2021, according to a new report from UNICEF. And the United Nations says tens of millions more children will suffer a similar fate as climate change worsens extreme weather worldwide.\nNearly 41 million displacements were driven by storms and floods alone, the report finds. Droughts and wildfires played a smaller, but still significant, role as well.\nThe Philippines, India and China saw the greatest total number of child displacements, with more than 23 million between them during the study period. That’s partly because India and China have the highest total populations in the world.\nBut other countries experienced greater losses relative to the size of their child populations, particularly small island developing nations and countries located in the Horn of Africa, the continent’s easternmost peninsula.\nThe number of displaced children on the island of Dominica from 2016 to 2021, for instance, was equivalent to 76 percent of the nation’s child population. These displacements were driven almost entirely by storms.\nReleased Thursday evening, the new report is among the first to estimate recent weather-related child displacements on a global basis. Children are often “statistically invisible” in existing databases, the report states, where displacement figures are rarely broken down by age.\nThe report doesn’t statistically distinguish between displacements caused by preemptive evacuations and those that were forced in the aftermath of extreme weather events. But it’s an important distinction for future studies to investigate. Properly managed evacuations can save lives and reduce the harm that families suffer when they’re suddenly displaced.\nYet many of the nations highlighted in the new report have limited resources for managed evacuations.\nSouth Sudan and Somalia saw 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of their child populations displaced by floods and drought during the study period. Yet these nations implement relatively few evacuations compared to wealthier countries, the report states, adding that “children living in these countries may be even more vulnerable to displacement risk.”\nThe report also employs a special model to predict future rates of child displacement. It suggests that tens of millions more children likely will be forced from their homes by climate disasters in the coming years.\nRiver floods will be a top driver, the model suggests, likely accounting for as many as 96 million displaced children over the next 30 years. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, and climate change is causing heavy precipitation events to intensify around the world, increasing the risks of catastrophic floods.\nCyclone winds could cause another 10.3 million child displacements over the next three decades, and storm surge could displace an additional 7.2 million.\nThe report highlights the need for greater investment in climate adaptation measures around the world, particularly in low-income nations, which house the world’s most vulnerable populations.\n“As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climate-driven movement,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s executive director, in a statement. “We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly. We need to strengthen efforts to prepare communities, protect children at risk of displacement, and support those already uprooted.”\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "'Morning After' Antibiotic Could Reduce STIs", "date": "2023-10-06 15:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nDraft CDC guidelines recommend doxycycline for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections in some populations\nA commonly used antibiotic could become a standard way to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea.\nOn October 2 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a draft guidance recommending that physicians prescribe doxycycline as a preventative therapy for certain people at high risk of acquiring STIs. If these guidelines go into effect, in addition to providing general sexual health counseling and STI screening, physicians could advise these individuals to take doxycycline as a postexposure prophylactic (PEP) after having unprotected sex. This strategy, known as doxy-PEP, “represents a new approach to addressing STI prevention,” the CDC wrote in a notice about the draft guidance.\nThe agency hopes that doxy-PEP, which can lower infection risk by half or more, could put a significant dent in the rising STI levels in the U.S. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of syphilis cases rose by 32 percent, while chlamydia and gonorrhea each rose by around 4 percent. “If we’re really honest about it, efforts to control STIs have failed, and we need to try something different,” says Edward Hook, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nScientific American talked with several experts about how well doxy-PEP works, why the CDC is not recommending it for everyone and what the risk of sexually transmitted bacteria becoming resistant to the drug is.\nWho should take doxy-PEP?\nBased on current evidence, the CDC is recommending that doctors only consider it for cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), as well as for transgender women, when these individuals have had at least one STI within the past year. The prescription would be for a pill that would be taken once within 72 hours of unprotected sex.\nThe agency said that there is not enough evidence to recommend doxy-PEP to cisgender women and transgender men. That’s because few trials in this population have been completed to date. The only major study, conducted in 449 women in Kenya, found no significant reductions in STIs among those who took doxy-PEP, although hair analysis later showed that many of the women weren’t taking the antibiotic.\nJenell Stewart, an infectious disease physician at Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis, who led the trial in Kenya, says she agrees with the CDC’s recommendations, given current evidence. She adds that it’s possible doxy-PEP could work differently in men and women because different body parts are exposed to bacteria that go on to colonize the body in different ways. “We shouldn’t assume it’ll work the same in everyone,” Stewart says. Her team is now setting up more studies in the U.S. and Kenya to see whether doxy-PEP works in more populations.\nWhat is the evidence for doxy-PEP?\nPostexposure prophylaxis has long been used in HIV prevention: people at risk are advised to take antiviral drugs within 72 hours after unprotected sex. Researchers took a similar approach with doxycycline for STIs in several recent clinical studies—two conducted in France and one conducted in the U.S. The studies found that a single dose of doxycycline could more than halve the rate of bacterial infection in MSM and transgender women. The treatment was more effective against chlamydia and syphilis than gonorrhea.\nThe CDC has based its new recommendations on the design of the U.S. study, which focused on MSM and transgender women in Seattle and San Francisco who were at very high risk of acquiring STIs because they had frequent unprotected sex. “They’re the group that stands to benefit the most,” says study leader Annie Luetkemeyer of the University of California, San Francisco.\nIn a paper published in April in the New England Journal of Medicine, Luetkemeyer’s group tested doxy-PEP or a placebo in around 500 MSM and transgender women who had a median of nine sexual partners within a three-month period. The participants reported that 90 percent of their sexual encounters were unprotected, and each person had gotten at least one STI within the past year. Taking one dose of doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex, Luetkemeyer found, reduced the risk of a bacterial infection by two thirds.\nAre scientists concerned about doxy-PEP worsening antibiotic resistance?\nSome experts worry that increased doxycycline use could drive antibiotic resistance in sexually transmitted pathogens. This is especially true of gonorrhea, which is particularly good at evading various antibiotics: around 25 percent of gonorrhea infections in the U.S. and the overwhelming majority of those in Kenya are already resistant to the class of antibiotics that includes doxycycline.\nThat could partly explain why one of the doxy-PEP studies in France, where around 60 percent of gonorrhea infections are resistant to antibiotics, found that the treatment had no significant impact on gonorrhea infection rates. “The issue of resistance in gonorrhea is not a matter of whether but when,” Hook says, although he adds he is an “enthusiast” about doxy-PEP in general.\nSo far there is little evidence that chlamydia and syphilis become resistant to antibiotics. Ongoing monitoring is needed, however. Scientists are also concerned that resistant bacteria could transfer genes that that confer antibiotic resistance to other bacterial species, which would be especially concerning because doxycycline is a go-to treatment for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and leptospirosis.\nCould taking doxycycline have unintended effects on a person’s microbiome? \nResearchers are concerned that frequent doxycycline use could affect the normal, healthy bacteria that colonize the gut, vagina and other parts of the human body. This microbiome is involved in many aspects of health—everything from gut function to mental health—and disrupting the balance of bacterial species can affect these systems or lead to other infections. Luetkemeyer and Stewart both say they are testing rectal swabs and other samples from people in their study to see whether the antibiotic changed the assortment of bacteria that colonize various parts of the body.\nWhat will happen when the CDC finalizes its recommendations?\nIn October 2022 San Francisco’s health department released its own guidelines supporting doxy-PEP in cisgender men and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI and have had unprotected sex with at least one cisgender man or transgender woman in the past year. Several other health departments, including California’s, have issued similar guidelines. Luetkemeyer says it will be helpful to have national guidelines, which will ensure that doctors everywhere know that doxy-PEP works and feel comfortable prescribing it. When health systems were developing guidelines for HIV prevention in the past, “we did a poor job of reaching the people who needed it most,” Luetkemeyer says. “Having guidelines helps start the dialog.”\nResearchers are planning to continue testing doxy-PEP in different populations. If the approach proves successful, the CDC may expand its recommendations in the future to include cisgender women and men who have sex with cisgender women.\nThe CDC will receive comments on the draft guidelines until November 16, 2023, and has not said when it will release a final rule.\nSara Reardon is a freelance journalist based in Bozeman, Mont.

{"title": "Journey to the Thawing Edge of Climate Change", "date": "2023-10-06 13:00:00", "text": "What is a permafrost thaw slump? Just imagine a massive hole with an area the size of more than nine football fields—and growing—where ice-cold ground once stood.\nJoc Bentley: Are you okay?\nSteve Kokelj: Yeah. No, I’m just looking around where everyone is. I have to do that once in a while. We had a bear almost walk into us the other day because we were, like, staring at a thaw slump. And we turn around, and we’re like, “Oh, that, that’d be a grizzly bear there.”\nBentley: That’s Steve Kokelj. And the reason he has to be on the lookout for grizzlies has everything to do with where we’re standing right now.\nKokelj: We’re, uh, we’re in the Northwest Territories.\nBentley: That’s the Northwest Territories in the high Canadian Arctic.\nHey, I’m Joc Bentley, and I’m out here just north of the Arctic Circle to take you on a journey to the thawing edge of climate change.\nOver the next three episodes of Science, Quickly, we’ll be mucking around in a part of the world that is warming faster than just about any other.\nJust a few years ago the tundra here was frozen solid, and now there’s a massive hole with an area the size of more than nine football fields—and growing. The ground is disappearing under our feet. I’m trying not to get too close because there’s a 20-meter drop-off.\nAnd I’m gonna say meters because I’m Canadian. Just getting that out of the way.\nThis used to be a landscape shaped by ice. Now it’s being completely transformed.\n[CLIP: Show music]\nBentley: But let’s get back to Steve. He’s here to study that now not-so-perma permafrost.\nKokelj: We’re on the Peel Plateau.\nBentley: Steve works for the Northwest Territories Geological Survey. He has a constant entourage of students, and he’s wearing an amazing Canadian lumberjack uniform.\nKokelj: Behind me is a type of permafrost landslide called a retrogressive thaw slump. That's a type of permafrost landslide that forms in areas where the permafrost contains a lot of ice.\nBentley: That thaw slump he’s talking about? That’s the hole. To picture it, you have to imagine what it would look like if a massive mound of earth just sorta turned into molasses one day and started flowing downhill.\nAnd the land that became molasses is really old.\nKokelj: So the ice that’s melting behind us is a leftover of the, of the glaciation that covered most of Canada, and it’s somewhere around [16,000] to 13,000 years old.\nBentley (tape): Does this mean we’re still in an ice age?\nKokelj: We are. We are still in an ice age. And the process of deglaciation, which is when the ice goes away, in the North, it hasn’t ended yet. So we’re still going through a period of deep glaciation here.\nBentley: This always blows my mind. We’re still in an ice age. And that means Earth has a lot of room to get even hotter. Canada is seeing some of the fastest warming on the planet. And Steve says that has huge implications, especially for our frozen ground.\nKokelj: Most people don’t, may not appreciate this, but half of Canada is affected by permafrost, right? So it’s the northern half. But now that everything’s changing, it’s becoming a really, really important discipline to understand and improve the resilience of the Canadian North but also to understand global change issues related to the carbon being released from permafrost.\nBentley: Half of Canada. That’s almost too large an area to really comprehend. And even when you’re standing next to a thaw slump, it can still be tough to appreciate how big the changes are here.\nSo we got in a chopper for a bird’s-eye view. Keellie Stachniak, our pilot, took us for a tour of nearby slumps. So hold on and listen close because it’s about to get real noisy.\n[CLIP: Helicopter taking off ambience]\nStachniak: Should I take them to a slump?\nKokelj: Yeah, same one as yesterday.\nRight beneath us, this debris tongue, it has infilled the whole valley, and it has accumulated about 35 meters.\nBentley: And just to put that into perspective, that’s as high as a 10-story building.\nKokelj: Yeah, a lot of these streams were clearwater streams before, right? The thaw slumps are releasing all these sediments, and they’re just changed, and they will be from now ...\nKeellie: Forever?\nKokelj: For the foreseeable future, yeah.\nThe materials that are coming out of the permafrost, it’s not so much their makeup, it’s the volume that are being put into the river systems here that are detrimental to the ecosystems.\nBentley: And Steve says this is just the beginning.\nKokelj: As the climate is warming and as summers are getting wetter, these types of disturbances are getting bigger. And in the past, under colder conditions, a thaw slump would grow over a period of a number of years and then stabilize. But as the climate’s warming, they continue to grow and impact larger areas of land.\nBentley: This isn’t just about land. There are Indigenous communities here that have been living off of this land for thousands of years. What’s going to happen to them?\nKokelj: So the people that live here are the Gwich’in people, and they’re very concerned about their landscape. They’re concerned about the water in their lakes and streams. They’re the people that have traditionally lived off of fish and caribou, of course. These types of disturbances, these types of landslides, deliver lots of sediment and other materials that have been locked into the permafrost into the streams, and that can affect the habitat in the streams and, and the health of the stream ecosystems.\nBentley: And the streams don’t only get filled with sediment. Steve and his team have seen entire lakes disappear. Both the Gwich’in and the Inuvialuit populations are facing some massive challenges.\nIn order to better predict what exactly is going to happen to permafrost on a warming planet, Steve’s team is running all kinds of experiments.\nOn the team, permafrost scientist Alice Wilson is trying to figure out if snow cover slows permafrost thaw. In the darkness of the freezing arctic winter, she manipulates the amount of snow on different areas of tundra. Then, when summer arrives, they check how much of the top layer of permafrost has melted.\nWilson: Alright, so what we’re doing right now is active layer, or thaw depth, measurements. So we use this graduated probe, where we have markings every 10 centimeters. So if we push it into the ground where we hit the bottom, you can kind of hear it sometimes. That’s the base of, at this time of year, the active layer and shows you where the frozen front is, or permafrost.\nBentley: And then Alice does these kinds of measurements again but in a different area with the same setup.\nWilson: And so we can measure this to see how deep it is to permafrost in different areas. And then the other thing I can pull out is this. So this is a thermosphere chain, and so it has a logger on top recording all the information. And then each of these has a temperature sensor. So we know the temperatures over time at different depths.\nBentley: Alice drops the line down a PVC tube running deep beneath our feet.\nWilson: So this would be half a meter, one meter, meter and a half, two. And this one goes all the way down to three meters below the ground and into the permafrost.\nBentley: The researchers are hoping all of these data will help to better predict what exactly is going to happen to the North in the decades to come. Steve is a big believer in the importance of the research performed by his entire team.\nKokelj: We just haven’t built our infrastructure, considering all these things, right? So it’s kind of one of the important reasons to just study things, because if you don’t make these observations, you can’t kind of adapt your infrastructure to deal with this kind of stuff. Yeah, a lot of the challenges can’t be overcome unless you do basic science, right?\nBentley: Science, Quickly is produced by Jeffery DelViscio, Tulika Bose and Kelso Harper.

{"title": "Know Yourself Better by Writing What Pops into Your Head", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThe exercise of writing down unfiltered thoughts enhances self-knowledge\nFor decades, physician and author Silke Heimes has been leading groups in therapeutic exercises to put thoughts and feelings down on paper. Heimes, a professor of journalism at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences,  points to abundant evidence that writing for five to 20 minutes a day can improve health, diminish stress, increase self-confidence and even kindle the imagination. A writing routine, she argues, is a form of mental hygiene that almost anyone can benefit from.\nSo how do you start? What happens if—as every writer fears—the page remains blank? And how do you get rid of an overcritical inner censor? Heimes, director of the Institute for Creative and Therapeutic Writing in Darmstadt, explains how to overcome inhibitions and open up your inner world.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nIf you want to write in order to understand yourself better, what's the best way to start?\nThere are writing exercises, for example in so-called fill-in journals, where you directly answer a question. But if I just want to get started without any aids, the best way is to use the method of automatic writing. That means I set myself a short time window, maybe five minutes, in which I write continuously without thinking, without putting down the pen or rereading what I’ve written. The goal is to get thoughts down on paper as unfiltered as possible so that an inner censor can't switch on—or at least doesn't get too loud. It helps not to set the goal too high—not to expect too much—but to understand this writing as a time-out, so to speak, or as a kind of warm-up exercise.\nWouldn’t it be helpful to ask yourself specific questions?\nIf you want to, you can follow programs that, for example, organize specific questions into topics. But that can also be inhibiting at times because such questions primarily get your head working to produce rational answers. Questions often steer thoughts along preconceived paths. Sometimes it is almost easier without them to let the gut lead the way.\nWhat if you just can't think of anything?\nThe half-sentence method can help. With this approach, you complete a given half-sentence such as \"When I woke up this morning” or “What happened to me today.” If you write in the morning, the [first example] is a good choice. Because everyone wakes up in the morning, everyone can think of something to say about it. The same applies to [the second example] if you write in the evening because you inevitably experienced something during the day by then. To start, you can also write down words that begin with the letters of your name and then create a text using those words.\nCan anything go wrong using these methods?\nNot really. Just as with thinking, you can of course get tangled up in your own thoughts or get stuck in brooding loops when writing. But that’s not the fault of the writing itself; it’s just something that becomes obvious on paper. Writing often deals with emotional issues, so you also might temporarily feel bad because something is stirred up or triggered. In that case, you should take a break and do something else or talk to someone about it. If the feeling persists, it is best to seek professional help.\nDoes it make a difference whether you write by hand or on a keyboard?\nWriting by hand is a very complex movement that activates more areas in the brain, which leads to being more creative. It also usually means slowing down, which invites you to pause and take a breath. In addition, there is something sensual and unique about writing by hand. because, for one thing, our handwriting is very individual. And for another thing, it tells us something about our state of mind. In fact, handwriting usually becomes rounder and livelier when we are in a good mood and smaller or tighter when we are not feeling so well. Typing on the keyboard, on the other hand has a soothing quality because it is very rhythmic. Further, it has the advantage of allowing you to share your writing more quickly. I think it’s always good to have both skills and to use them.\nYou have guided many groups in this type of writing. How does that typically work?\nWe first do little writing exercises to warm up. Many people come with the expectation that they’ll sit down, and the writing will flow right away—that they’ll perform brilliantly almost off the cuff. But no athlete, no musician would expect that of themselves. Professional writers know better.\nAnd there are other common misconceptions. The biggest one is “I can't write.” A lot of people come to my seminars with this attitude. But we can all write. Rather the problem is the often exaggerated demands we place on ourselves. I like to quote French writer André Breton, who invented automatic writing. He said, mutatis mutandis, that if you want to write, find a nice place, sit down in peace and quiet and forget about seeking out brilliant thoughts.\nIs there anything else that people particularly struggle with when it comes to writing?\nWe’ve already talked about your own performance expectations. But what can also lead to inhibitions is the fear of emotions or of your personal history—fear of confronting possibly painful topics. And further problems usually arise when people want to put their thoughts into a literary form in order to publish them.\nWhat if someone only produces platitudes? What if they sound banal or superficial?\nWho decides that? That is a judgment that should be unacceptable in creative and therapeutic writing. Everyone expresses what is important, right and possible for them at that moment, and I think that is precisely what deserves appreciation.\nWhat do people in your groups write about most often?\nThey write about the topic of self-worth—that is, the fear of not being good enough—about not being heard or seen and about the topic of freedom versus security, especially at work.\nAnd what insights do they go home with?\nThat varies greatly. But they often take home a lot of pieces of paper, and that’s how they recognize that they can definitely write. They have produced something and are justifiably proud of it. This increases their self-esteem, and they develop more confidence. Writing also sharpens perception and promotes mindfulness. People notice more quickly when something is not good for them and find better ways to deal with those problems. And when thoughts go round in circles, putting them down on paper clears the mind. After that you have more capacity for other things in your life.\nCan these benefits be probed empirically?\nThere are [hundreds] of studies on the effect of expressive or therapeutic writing. Many of them come from the psychologist James Pennebaker, who did research on this primarily with students.\nDo you write a lot yourself?\nYes, every day. I work on a novel or nonfiction book every day, and I also jot down my thoughts for three minutes in the morning. These few minutes of mental hygiene are as important and natural to me as brushing my teeth every day.\nThis article originally appeared in Spektrum der Wissenschaft and was reproduced with permission.\nChristiane Gelitz is a psychologist and an editor at Spektrum der Wissenschaft.\nJocie Bentley\nEmily Hemendinger and The Conversation US\nMeghan Bartels\nChelsea Harvey and E&E News\nSara Reardon\nJocie Bentley\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Millions of Mosquitoes Will Rain Down on Hawaii to Save an Iconic Bird", "date": "2023-10-06 11:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nHawaii’s brightly colored honeycreepers are at imminent risk of extinction, and bacteria could be the key to saving them\nMillions of mosquitoes dropped from helicopters could be the greatest hope for Hawaii’s iconic honeycreepers. At least four species of the brightly colored birds could go extinct within the year if no action is taken to save them. “We’re seriously in a race against time at the moment,” says Hanna Mounce, program manager of the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project.\nThese small birds evolved on the islands over the course of millions of years and are uniquely adapted to their niche habitat, where they are crucial pollinators for many of Hawaii’s flora. For the people of Hawaii, the honeycreepers are also woven into the cultural fabric, featuring prominently in many legends and providing feathers for traditional garments. More than 50 species of honeycreepers once flitted across the archipelago, but because of introduced predators, habitat destruction and disease, that number has dwindled to only 17. Invasive Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes—possibly introduced via water barrels on European ships in the early 19th century—pose a particular threat because they spread the deadly avian malaria parasite.\nThe honeycreepers that still survive today live high in the mountains, where it is too cool for mosquitoes. Rising temperatures are widening the mosquitoes’ habitat, however, and every year they move higher up the mountain slopes—and kill birds as they go. Four species of honeycreeper—the ʻAkekeʻe (Loxops caeruleirostris) and the ʻAkikiki (Oreomsytis bairdi) on the Hawaiian island of Kauai and the Kiwikiu (Pseudonestor xanthophrys) and ʻĀkohekohe (Palmeria dolei) on Maui—are in particularly dire straits. “We have one more warm year, and we're not going to have any birds left,” Mounce says.\nBirds, Not Mosquitoes, a consortium of more than a dozen state, federal, industry and conservation partners, including the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project, is pinning the birds’ immediate future on the so-called incompatible insect technique (IIT). To date, this mosquito-control method has only been used for mosquito-borne diseases that affect humans, Mounce says. On two islands in China, for example, the technique cut dengue-carrying mosquito populations by 90 percent.\nIIT works like this: C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, as well as many other arthropods, naturally contain Wolbachia bacteria in their gut. In order to produce offspring together, mating mosquitoes must be infected with the same strain of the bacteria. Birds, Not Mosquitoes’ plan involves releasing male mosquitoes bred by Verily Life Sciences—the life sciences research arm of Alphabet, which also owns Google. These mosquitos will host a different Wolbachia strain than those on Maui. The idea is that the existing female mosquitoes will mate with the male newcomers, but because of their incompatible Wolbachia bacteria, they will not produce viable offspring. If all goes according to plan, the overall mosquito population will plummet.\nBirds, Not Mosquitoes initially ran trial studies by releasing 5,000 to 30,000 IIT mosquitoes at a time to study their dispersal and longevity in the wild. The team found that although the introduced mosquitoes lived longer than local ones, they did not move far from the release site. This means that future mosquito releases will need to be spaced closer together. For the next phase beginning in November, the consortium will drop 250,000 treated mosquitoes twice a week over about 3,000 acres in east Maui for a year. They will be contained in mango-sized biodegradable capsules that can each hold about 1,000 mosquitoes.\nSuccess, however, hinges not only on reducing mosquito population numbers but also on ensuring that the new Wolbachia strain does not establish itself in the local mosquito population. If the local mosquitoes become infected primarily with the new Wolbachia, then they will be able to produce offspring with the introduced mosquitoes; that would defeat the goal of the technique and project. To prevent that outcome, the team will set egg traps to check for the new Wolbachia strain. If it is found, the project will stop releases “until there is none of that [strain of] Wolbachia detected in the landscape before we’re able to start again,” Mounce says.\nOnly female mosquitoes bite, and the project is not releasing any females. If the intervention works, the number of female mosquitoes in the release area will plummet, and the next step will be a landscape-wide release of these doctored mosquitoes. “If there are no female mosquitoes in those areas, then they can’t bite the birds, and there can’t be any malaria transmission,” Mounce says. Mosquitoes are not endemic to the islands and woven into native ecosystems in the same way that, for example, honeycreepers are. Consequently, scientists do not expect their removal to harm the environment.\nThis approach is not a full solution to the birds' plight. Rather “it’s a Band-Aid to buy time,” says M. Renee Bellinger, a research geneticist at the U.S. Geological Survey, which is one of the consortium’s partners. “We recognize that it’s not a permanent solution. But it is the solution that is available at the moment and has a regulatory pathway that is defined so that we can get the tool on the landscape.” Other concurrent interventions in the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Strategy for Preventing the Extinction of Hawaiian Forest Birds include establishing captive care programs, relocating honeycreepers who belong to the most at-risk species, developing gene drive technology to curb mosquitoes’ ability to transmit the malaria parasite and increasing birds’ malaria resistance.\nThe IIT plan has a lot of potential, especially in settings such as Hawaii’s forests, where insecticide use would be problematic, says Rosemary Lees, a principal research associate at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England, who is not involved with the project in Hawaii. “As with all new techniques, it will be critical to monitor the effects of the releases, to collect the operational data critical to evaluate impact and maximize cost-effectiveness and coverage,” she says.\nIf the IIT intervention fails, it may be necessary to move the honeycreepers out of mosquito-infested areas. Sam ‘Ohu Gon III, a senior scientist and a cultural adviser at the Nature Conservancy, says other islands with higher elevation could provide a refuge to some birds. “Those birds are doomed unless they can be pulled out of that habitat,” he says.\nBut Gon remains optimistic that the IIT will work, at least as a stopgap. “I’m very hopeful,” he says, “that it can stave off the fact that some of these birds might be extinct in one or two years if we do nothing.”\nSarah Wild is a freelance science journalist, who splits her time between Johannesburg in South Africa and Canterbury in the United Kingdom.

{"title": "The Sky Is Full of Stars--and Exoplanets, Too", "date": "2023-10-06 10:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nOf the thousands of stars visible to the eye, only a few hundred are known to have planets. But that number may be far higher in reality\nI remember quite clearly when we only knew of nine planets in the entire universe.\nThat was the case on the first day of 1992, but scarcely a week later, everything changed. On January 9 of that year astronomers announced the discovery of the very first exoplanets—worlds orbiting stars other than our own. These new planets are so weird that it was difficult to grasp how profoundly they changed our cosmic context: they orbit a pulsar, a rapidly spinning, ultradense, city-sized stellar remnant left behind after a massive star exploded as a supernova. Although that’s extremely interesting, it’s not entirely satisfying. A pulsar is the least sunlike kind of star out there, and we, as irredeemably self-centered human beings, prefer to find places more like home—planets around stars more like our own.\nThen, in 1995, astronomers announced they’d found one: 51 Pegasi b, a Jupiter-class planet circling a star that very much resembled our sun in size, mass and age.\nAnd at just a hair more than 50 light-years away, 51 Pegasi is a naked-eye star.\nIt’s not easy to spot—at a magnitude of 5.5, you need a dark site and a moonless night to see it—but that does raise an interesting question: How many naked-eye stars host planets? It’s surprisingly challenging to definitively answer this question, as we’ll see, so let’s slightly rephrase: How many naked-eye stars host planets that we know about?\nFinding the answer appears to be a snap because you can look it up in databases such as NASA’s Exoplanet Archive, which offers a treasure trove of information on alien worlds. Searching NASA’s database for planets orbiting naked-eye stars (that is, ones with a magnitude of less than 6.0) yields a pretty specific answer: 183.\nBecause nothing in science is ever that cut-and-dried, however, it’s not quite that simple. For example, three of these planets remain officially unconfirmed, bringing the number down to 180. And at least 20 of them are each about 13 times heavier than Jupiter, the largest and most massive planet in our solar system. That means they skirt the border of being objects called brown dwarfs, which are beefier than proper planets but don’t have quite enough oomph to ignite nuclear fusion in their cores to become true stars. With that in mind, the actual number of naked-eye stars hosting known exoplanets is probably around 150 to 160.\nMany of these are easy to see and are among the brightest stars in the sky.\nThe most brilliant in this sample is Aldebaran, a star 66 light-years from Earth that marks the eye of the bull Taurus. It’s a red giant, a star that was once much like the sun but is starting to bloat and die, having run out of hydrogen fuel in its core. Its planet, Aldebaran b, is a gas giant orbiting the star at about the same distance that Mars orbits the sun. Given that the star is more than 400 times more luminous than the sun, Aldebaran b is getting cooked.\nPollux, one of the twin stars at the head of Gemini (the other being the almost equally bright Castor), is another quite bright exoplanetary host. At 34 light-years from us, it’s closer to Earth than Aldebaran is, and it’s also a red giant. Pollux’s planet, Pollux b, is another gas giant that’s also getting blasted by intense stellar light.\nThe closest naked-eye star known to have planets is Tau Ceti, a mere 11.9 light-years from our world. It hosts at least four planets, which range in mass from about two to four times that of Earth. These planets are so-called super-Earths—they are more massive and larger than Earth but are perhaps still-rocky planets that are similar to ours. One of them, Tau Ceti f, even orbits at the right distance from the star to potentially be habitable—under a sufficiently broad definition of “habitable,” that is.\nThe most interesting thing about this list, however, is the stars that aren’t on it. Aldebaran, the brightest, is only about the 13th brightest star in the night sky. Why haven’t we found planets around the dozen brighter ones?\nThere are many reasons, actually. One is that they may simply not have planets. Many of these stars are difficult to observe for planets. Some of them are intrinsically variable, for example, meaning they fluctuate in brightness, which can confound exoplanet surveys. Capella, the fifth brightest star (not including the sun) is at least a quadruple star system, with four stars orbiting one another. Two of them are old, evolved stars, like Aldebaran and Pollux, and orbit so closely together that it’s unlikely there’s a planet around either one of them. Perhaps a planet orbits both farther out, but this has not yet been determined.\nSirius, the brightest star in the night sky, has no confirmed planets. That may be because it’s a binary star, and the two stars move around each other on a mildly elliptical orbit, which could destabilize planetary orbits. One of the stars expired long ago, blowing off its outer layers and becoming a dense and tiny white dwarf. Such an event may not totally disrupt a planetary system but is not exactly great for them, either. Although a search for planets in the Sirius system has ruled out any that would be much more massive than Jupiter, less massive ones may yet await discovery.\nOne oddity on this list of naked-eye exoplanet no-shows involves the famous star Alpha Centauri. It’s actually a triple star system, with two sunlike stars that orbit each other and a third star, called Proxima Centauri, that is much farther out. The aptronymically named Proxima is the closest star to our sun. Despite its proximity, it’s a dim bulb that is so faint that it demands a decent telescope to be seen at all. Neither of the two brighter stars has been confirmed to have planets after intensive searches. Yet Proxima hosts at least two planets, and a third one is strongly suspected. So, in a sense, one of the brightest star systems in the sky, and the closest one to us, hosts planets, but the specific star they orbit is not visible to unaided vision. Although I’m not sure that counts for our list, it’s still a cool situation.\nGiven that there are about 9,000 stars visible to the naked eye, the fraction of them known to host planets is surprisingly small. A lot of this may be because of how we find planets, however. So far most have been found via the transit method, when we happen to see the planet’s orbit edge on so that, once per revolution, it passes directly in front of the star and creates a mini eclipse. The amount of light we see from the star dips a small amount, revealing the planet’s presence.\nBut as this chancy viewing geometry suggests, most planets will never transit as seen from Earth, which renders them effectively invisible to this workhorse detection technique. So from a statistical standpoint, our searches to date have missed a large fraction of existing planets. Present estimates are such that the actual number of planets out there could be at least 10 times higher. The meaningful takeaway of all this is that most stars in the galaxy probably host planets. We just haven’t seen them yet—at least not with the transit method or any of the various other methods that have added smaller numbers of worlds to our galactic tally.\nThink on that the next time you’re outside at night under a clear sky. It may well be that nearly every star you see has planets. The odds are that trillions of them exist in the Milky Way alone. From being able to count all the known planets on two hands to cataloging thousands to positing the existence of trillions, we’ve made incredible progress in our census of worlds in the past 30 years.\nIf there is a single astronomical fact that makes my heart pound a little harder and fills it with wonder and joy, that may very well be it.\nPhil Plait is a professional astronomer and science communicator in Colorado.

{"title": "Ancient Footprints Affirm People Lived in the Americas More Than 20,000 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 18:15:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA new study suggests humans arrived in the Americas before the height of the last ice age more than 20,000 years ago\nFossilized human footprints found in New Mexico’s White Sands National Park were almost certainly made more than 20,000 years ago, during the height of the last ice age, according to new research. The study, published on Thursday in Science, overthrows decades of thinking about when humans arrived in North America.\nThe researchers determined the ages of pollen grains and tiny quartz crystals in sediments beside the footprints, which are buried a few feet below the surface. The work confirms a 2021 study’s findings, which were based on radiocarbon dates from aquatic plant seeds in the sediments. The new results “are statistically indistinguishable from the seed ages,” says Jeff Pigati, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey and co-lead author of the new study. “We’ve now got three different dating techniques—radiocarbon dating of the seeds, radiocarbon dating of the pollens and luminescence dating of the quartz—that all show people were there.”\nThe 2021 announcement of the astonishingly ancient age of the footprints, which were found alongside a dried-up lake in the park, created controversy among archaeologists. Until then, many scientists had thought that the Clovis people became the first known Americans when they arrived from the north about 13,000 years ago, as the ice sheets across North America were retreating. (The Clovis are named after a town in New Mexico where their stone spear points were unearthed in the 1930s, but their artifacts have since been found throughout Central and North America.)\nThe White Sands footprints, however, suggest humans had already lived in New Mexico for thousands of years by the time the Clovis culture began.\nSkeptics questioned the dating method used in the 2021 study, which measured the levels of radioactive carbon 14 in seeds of the freshwater plant Ruppia cirrhosa—also known as spiral ditchgrass—in layers of sediment above and below the footprints. The critics argued water might have flowed through ancient rocks before it was absorbed by the seeds and thereby transmitted carbon that could make them seem older than they really were.\nBut the alternative dating methods refute that idea, says co-lead study author Kathleen Springer, a USGS geologist. “It’s a paradigm-shattering result,” she says. “People were in New Mexico during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the massive ice sheets farther north were [impassable]—that just flies in the face of all ideas about migrations and migratory routes,” she adds, referring to the last ice age’s peak, which occurred between 26,000 and 20,000 years ago.\nIn the new study, the researchers determined the radiocarbon age of microscopic pollen grains in the sediment layers, which hadn’t grown in the lake water. They also found the pollen came from plants that no longer grow in the area. “There’s pollen from pine and spruce and fir, which grow at much higher elevations today,” Springer says. “So the flora indicates that ecosystem extended down to the valley floor 20,000 years ago.”\nThe researchers also dated the sediments with a technique called optically stimulated luminescence, which can determine when minerals were last exposed to daylight. Samples for the technique must be processed in the dark, which the scientists achieved by hammering tubes into the buried sediments and studying them under red light that wouldn’t affect the dating, Pigati says. They then measured the almost imperceptible glow of quartz grains in the samples under specific frequencies of light, and the resulting dates matched those from the radiocarbon method, he says.\nThe new dates confirm the picture of a now vanished landscape at White Sands more than 20,000 years ago, when camels, elephants and giant sloths roamed beside a lake and were probably prey for human hunters. And the human footprints suggest people arrived there up to 30,000 years ago, before the ice sheets made migration from the north impossible.\nSome of the White Sands footprints appear on the surface as “ghost tracks,\" which are only visible when the ground is damp. Scientists think they are caused by water evaporating above fossilized footprints that are buried deeper underground. The team dug a trench in the soil to reveal the buried footprints and take samples for testing. “There are thousands of megafaunal and human footprints at White Sands,” Springer explains. “On some days you can’t see anything, but when the moisture content is just right, they fully pop to your eye.”\nGeologist Cynthia Liutkus-Pierce of Appalachian State University, who has studied ancient human footprints in Tanzania and wasn’t involved in the new White Sands research, says the study further supports the presence of humans in North America during the last ice age. “This is exciting and will certainly have scientists rethinking how humans interacted with the North American environment during the [Last Glacial Maximum],” she says.\nAnthropologist Kimberly Foecke of the Smithsonian Institution, who also wasn’t involved in the study, is now “reasonably convinced” of the antiquity of the footprints.* “These results add to the still scant but growing evidence of human presence in the Americas around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum,” she says.\n*Editor’s Note (10/5/23): This sentence was edited after posting.

{"title": "10,000 Pre-Columbian Structures Could Be Hidden beneath Amazon Rain Forest", "date": "2023-10-05 18:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nIf this new estimate holds up, scientists have yet to identify the vast majority of earthworks strewn across the Amazon\nIn the millennia before European colonizers invaded the Amazon rain forest, throngs of Indigenous people moved mountains of dirt to create some 10,000 yet-to-be-identified earthworks across the region.\nThat’s according to new research published on Thursday in Science that identifies two dozen sites where massive amounts of dirt formed circular and rectangular geoglyphs, settlements and religious sites. Based on what the researchers knew about such structures, they estimated the huge number of these mysterious constructions that are likely hidden somewhere beneath still unsearched forest. The model supports theories that hold the Amazon, which covers a huge swath of South America, was densely populated before colonization, and it may strengthen political efforts to uphold the modern sovereignty of the forest’s Indigenous inhabitants.\nTo look for these sites, the researchers found data gathered for other studies of biomass in the northern, central and southern regions of the Amazon rain forest. Those studies relied on a so-called light detection and ranging (lidar) system that bounces an airborne laser off Earth’s surface as it passes overhead, measuring trees’ canopies but also revealing the ground below them. “We thought, ‘Maybe the ground can tell us some stories about the archaeology as well,’” says Vinícius Peripato, a doctoral candidate in remote sensing at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research and co-lead author of the new study. “At the beginning, it was a complete shot in the dark; we had no idea if we would find anything.”\nBut in that initial data, which represent less than one tenth of 1 percent of the Amazon’s total area, he and his colleagues found 24 novel earthworks to add to the nearly 1,000 previously known examples. The new sites are between 500 and 1,500 years old, and they include a fortified village, other settlement sites and religious structures, Peripato says. The fortified village had a central plaza and would have been part of a local urban network in the southern Amazon, while the geoglyphs included a cluster of ringlike designs. (Geoglyphs are a type of land art in which dirt is shaped into designs that can be viewed from overhead.)\nNext, the researchers used computer modeling to analyze known earthwork sites and predict their spread across the Amazon. That work considered a range of geographical factors such as distance to water, elevation and soil type (sandy soils, for instance, make short-lived earthworks). That work yielded the estimate that there are at least 10,000 earthworks—perhaps even twice that many—hidden across the Amazon. To date, scientists have only found about 1,000 such sites.\nThe sheer magnitude of that estimate supports previous calculations of a pre-Columbian population of eight million to 10 million in the Amazon, says Eduardo Neves, an archaeologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, who was not involved in the new research. He’s confident in those population assessments even if the true number of hidden earthworks isn’t quite 10,000. “To be honest, it’s hard to evaluate that number,” he says of the study’s earthwork prediction. “But I think it’s not off the mark; I think it’s a good number.”\nAnd the experience of archaeologists who study the ancient Maya—and have used lidar to uncover entire networks of cities hidden in the jungle in Central America—suggests that as lidar observations of the area develop, their colleagues now beginning such work in Amazonia will indeed find a trove of new sites. “We thought the Maya area was very well studied, but when we started to do lidar work [there], we had lots of surprises,” says Takeshi Inomata, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the Science study. “I think there will be more of those surprises in Amazonia.”\nYet all three researchers, however, say that the importance of the study isn’t so much about the precise number of sites. Rather it’s about the scale of human involvement in the Amazon rain forest. Neves argues that the Amazon is not a “natural” region that is purely produced by plants and nonhuman animals and is instead a “biocultural” one that is defined by the interaction of humans with nature. “There’s a still-common popular perception that the Amazon is a vast, wild expanse, but that’s not really true,” Inomata says. “This study really shows well that there was a lot of involvement of humans in this environment.”\nFor instance, the scientists also studied which trees were commonly found near earthworks and noted species that include the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and the breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum). That analysis suggests people were cultivating these trees—and their tasty offerings—at sites they frequented. It’s both another clue archaeologists can use to target their search for earthworks and a clear form of people leaving their mark on the forest they lived in.\nThat mark may have real political consequences for their descendants, who are fighting to hold on to the Amazon in the face of agricultural interests and others that could infringe on the forest. Researchers say that the new study supports Indigenous people’s claims of having permeated the Amazon and making it their own, which can strengthen their chances of gaining official stewardship of the forest. “It’s impossible to disentangle the Amazon that we know today from the lives and the history of the Indigenous people who have been living there for millennia,” Neves says. “There’s no future for the forest without a future for the people who have been living there for the last millennia.”\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist and news reporter for Scientific American who is based in New York City.\nUyunkar Domingo Peas Nampichkai, Juan Manuel Crespo and Jesús Chávez | Opinion\nEmma Bryce\nJennifer Nalewicki and LiveScience\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "95 Percent of Penicillin Allergy Diagnoses Are Wrong. A New Test Could Help", "date": "2023-10-05 17:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA simplified penicillin allergy test could help reduce false positives, but doctors face challenges in using it\nIf you’ve been told your whole life that you have a penicillin allergy, you’d be forgiven for not giving it a second thought. About one in 10 people in the U.S. report having this condition, making it the most common drug allergy in the country—and seemingly ordinary. In reality, 95 percent of those diagnosed with a penicillin allergy aren’t actually allergic. The impact of the sheer number of misdiagnoses is worthy of attention. When treating patients who have an allergy to the antibiotic on their medical record, doctors must turn to other antibiotics that are less effective and more expensive and can lead to serious health complications.\nA small contingent of health care professionals is working to remove the millions of false penicillin allergy diagnoses from individuals’ medical records. Experts say that educating their medical colleagues and the public about the rampant number of falsely diagnosed penicillin allergies and using an easier new test could curb the issue. But removing so many diagnoses from the health record and changing the larger public concern around penicillin allergy may be challenging. Shaking an incorrect penicillin allergy diagnosis has proved difficult among people who have held onto one “longer than a pet, even longer than a student loan,” says Christopher Bland, an associate professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Georgia. “It almost becomes a part of them.”\nPenicillin is not just the name of a single antibiotic—it is also a blanket term for the family of drugs containing chemical relatives of penicillin such as amoxicillin or methicillin. Penicillin antibiotics, which kill bacteria by preventing them from building a cell wall, are used to treat various illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis, skin infections and dental abscesses. They are also the first-choice treatment for common childhood infections.\nWhen doctors ramped up penicillin treatments in the early 1940s, reports of adverse reactions, such as hives, soon emerged. In 1949 doctors reported the first case of penicillin-caused death from anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that lowers blood pressure and impairs breathing. “That was a shock that both the public and health care workers of all types never really forgot,” says Richard Olans, an infectious disease expert at MelroseWakefield Hospital in Massachusetts. Hives and anaphylaxis are true allergic reactions that result from the immune system producing antibodies that target penicillin like it would if it were fighting a pathogen such as a cold or flu virus. These reactions are rare.\nMost people are misdiagnosed with a penicillin allergy in childhood when they take the drug to treat illnesses such as ear infections. Many kids develop a rash, which can appear like an allergic reaction to penicillin but is actually related to viral infections that often occur alongside bacterial ones. “Now we have so many studies that show that these kids are not ever truly allergic when they get these small rashes,” says Ana-Maria Copaescu, an allergy and immunology specialist at McGill University Health Center in Quebec.\nAdditionally, common side effects of penicillin, such as headaches, diarrhea and nausea, are often mistaken as an allergic response, Bland explains. “Most of the time, the patient has the reaction in their mind,” he says. “Then they just report it as an allergy.” People may also falsely get a penicillin allergy diagnosis because a parent or other relative was allergic.\n“There are a lot of myths about drug allergy that stem back to the discovery of penicillin,” says Elizabeth Phillips, an immunology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\nPenicillin allergy testing has helped untangle real allergies from misdiagnoses. The current gold standard test—only conducted in specialized allergy clinics—involves pricking the skin and injecting a small amount of penicillin. If the person doesn’t react to the skin prick, they are given a small oral dose of an antibiotic in the penicillin family, usually amoxicillin. Should they tolerate the oral dose, the penicillin allergy can be removed from their medical record.\nTesting has helped doctors realize how few people are truly allergic. Studies have shown that even among individuals who’ve experienced anaphylaxis, 80 percent lose penicillin antibodies after a decade. This is a huge deal for the long-term health and future antibiotic treatment of potentially millions of people who could take the drug safely. “I think one of the worst things to have on your profile as a patient is a penicillin allergy,” Bland says.\nThe alternative medications doctors prescribe to people with a penicillin allergy have more side effects and are less effective. They are usually less targeted, so using them is like casting a net to catch a pathogen rather than shooting an arrow at it. That means they can kill off good bacteria and lead to the overgrowth of potentially dangerous ones such as Clostridium difficile or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Less-targeted antibiotics also give more bacteria the chance to evolve ways to survive, spurring new antibiotic-resistant strains that can have a wider impact on the human population.\nIn addition to the health burdens, there’s also a financial one. A 2018 study found that hospitalized people in several countries, including the U.S., with a documented penicillin allergy paid up to $4,250 more for their visit. Kimberly Blumenthal, an allergist and immunologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, co-authored a 2021 study showing that the cost of having a penicillin allergy overwhelmingly outweighed the cost of running a penicillin allergy test because the alternative antibiotics are more expensive.\nBut even after correcting the penicillin allergy label with the test, it can persist on many people’s health record. Getting rid of an erroneous penicillin allergy diagnosis is a multifaceted issue: “It’s electronic. It’s culture. It’s fear,” says Rita Olans, a nurse practitioner and an associate professor at the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions. Incompletely clearing a penicillin allergy from a person’s electronic health record can cause it to follow them from doctor to doctor. Bland and Copaescu both give people a physical card to show other doctors they tested negative for a penicillin allergy in case it wasn’t completely cleared from the electronic health record. Many people are still afraid to use the drug even after they’ve been cleared, however. One study found that 41 percent of people who had been told they had a penicillin allergy but later tested negative still avoided penicillin.\nMany doctors agree that educating enough people on how to identify potentially incorrect penicillin allergy diagnoses and perform tests is a significant issue. Olans is teaching her nursing students to take more complete allergy histories that could help root out potentially erroneous ones. But even then, allergy tests must be carried out in specialized allergy clinics that are inaccessible to much of the population. “I think the challenges right now are really related to the bottleneck of the process occurring in our specialty clinics,” Phillips says.\nTo try and address the testing bottleneck, Blumenthal developed an algorithm that evaluates patient histories and guides health care workers on the best antibiotics to use so that they can triage the patients that should be sent for allergy testing. The algorithm is now integrated with the electronic health record across all hospital sites in her health system.\nIn people who are unlikely to have a severe penicillin allergy, doctors may streamline the testing process by skipping the skin test and using just the oral dose. People in this low-risk group, which includes approximately 98 percent of penicillin allergies, experienced only mild reactions or unrelated symptoms when given the drug. Oral tests were previously considered riskier because they could cause a severe reaction, but a recent large randomized controlled trial led by Copaescu showed for the first time that oral doses are as effective and safe as skin tests for people who have never had a severe allergic reaction. “More and more, colleagues and allergists that work in a hospital setting are using this direct oral [test] based on studies like ours,” says Copaescu, who published the results of the trial in July.\nCopaescu says that the oral test alone is cheaper and less painful for patients and doesn’t require specialized training. “It expanded who was doing direct [oral tests] in low-risk patients,” says Blumenthal, who wasn’t involved in the trial. With the simplified test, more people could theoretically be freed of their incorrectly diagnosed drug allergy. Blumenthal’s next step is to work with primary care doctors and their patients to use this type of testing in primary care clinics and verify penicillin allergies proactively rather than at the time people need the drugs most.\nBland sees performing proactive testing as a part of routine care, like vaccination, as the ultimate goal. This way, people can have penicillin on standby if they need it. Many people will encounter a bacterial infection in their lives, Bland says. “You’re going to need an antibiotic,” he adds. “It’s very, very likely. And it could be the one that saves your life.”\nAndrew Chapman is a Truckee, Calif.–based freelance science writer who covers life sciences and the environment.\nAmanda Montañez\nKaren Hopkin\nThe Editors\nJaimie Seaton\nDiscover world-changing science.

Florida Is Conspicuously Not among Them", "date": "2023-10-05 16:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nMore states are requiring homeowners to disclose a property’s flood risk and history when they sell it. But 18 states, including hurricane-prone Florida, have no flood disclosure requirements\nCLIMATEWIRE | Prospective homebuyers in more states are being told of the flood risk and history of the properties they want to purchase thanks to an uptick in flood disclosure requirements.\nA new analysis by the National Resources Defense Council shows that the number of states with strong flood disclosure policies has jumped to seven from four since 2021. North Carolina soon could become the eighth.\nThe NRDC and others have urged states to require the disclosure during property sales to help buyers decide whether to purchase flood insurance, protect the property or skip the deal. Research has shown disclosure can devalue flood-prone properties and discourage development in risky areas.\n“More states are recognizing that flood disclosure is a crucial tool,” said Joel Scata, an NRDC water and climate attorney who wrote the recent analysis. “States see it as a good way to help protect people.”\nFlood disclosure is increasingly important as climate change causes more frequent and intense flooding, advocates say. They compare flood disclosure to the federal requirement that property owners tell prospective buyers and tenants about any lead-based paint in a home.\nThe three states with new disclosure policies are New York, New Jersey and South Carolina. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed the law Sept. 22, calling it a “monumental step” toward protecting New Yorkers from the effects of climate change.\nNew York and New Jersey had received F grades from the NRDC in its previous analysis, released in 2021, because neither state required any disclosure of flood history and risk. New York had a disclosure requirement, but sellers could skip it by giving buyers a $500 credit on a purchase price. The new law removes the option.\nBoth states now have laws requiring disclosure for prospective buyers and renters.\nSouth Carolina previously received a C from the NRDC, indicating its flood disclosure policy was “adequate.”\nThe new policy was implemented in June by the South Carolina Real Estate Commission, a state agency that expanded the information required on its mandatory disclosure statement.\nThe North Carolina Real Estate Commission is considering a similar move after being petitioned by groups including the Southern Environmental Law Center and the North Carolina Justice Center. The commission is reviewing hundreds of public comments on a revised disclosure form.\nFour states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas — retained the top ratings they received in the 2021 NRDC report. Texas expanded its disclosure law in 2022 to apply to rental properties.\nThe top flood disclosure policies require prospective buyers and tenants to receive a form describing whether a home has sustained flood damage, is in a flood zone, is required to be covered by flood insurance or has received any federal money for flood repair.\nDespite the increase in flood disclosure, 18 states remain without any disclosure requirement, including Florida, the nation’s third-largest state and most vulnerable to hurricanes, and Alabama and Georgia, according to the NRDC report.\n\"Florida homebuyers are greatly disadvantaged when it comes to learning of a home's past flood history or potential for future flooding,\" the NRDC report says. The report says a disclosure form created by Florida Realtors is voluntary.\nScata of the NRDC said Florida is showing signs of progress. Four disclosure bills were introduced in the Florida Legislature during its session earlier this year, including one measure that had bipartisan sponsorship. All the bills failed, but Scata said, “You’ll start to see more states push disclosure laws.”\nMany of the states with no disclosure requirement are in New England or the Mountain time zone.\nThe NRDC score card is one of the few analyses of flood disclosure laws in each state.\nIn 2022, the Federal Emergency Management Agency published a reportthat rates each state on a 10-point scale based on the number of required flood disclosures.\nFEMA has been advocating for states to improve flood disclosure and is considering imposing its own requirement, though it is unclear how the agency would do so. Insurance is regulated by state agencies and not the federal government.\nFannie Mae urged FEMA to require flood disclosure, saying that flood awareness \"remains low\" and the government is \"by far the most trusted source\" for flood information.\nFEMA’s report was similar to the NRDC analysis in 2021 and gave Louisiana a perfect score of 10, followed by Texas with a score of 8.\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "The Latest AI Chatbots Can Handle Text, Images and Sound. Here's How", "date": "2023-10-05 16:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNew “multimodal” AI programs can do much more than respond to text—they also analyze images and chat aloud\nSlightly more than 10 months ago OpenAI’s ChatGPT was first released to the public. Its arrival ushered in an era of nonstop headlines about artificial intelligence and accelerated the development of competing large language models (LLMs) from Google, Meta and other tech giants. Since that time, these chatbots have demonstrated an impressive capacity for generating text and code, albeit not always accurately. And now multimodal AIs that are capable of parsing not only text but also images, audio, and more are on the rise.\nOpenAI released a multimodal version of ChatGPT, powered by its LLM GPT-4, to paying subscribers for the first time last week, months after the company first announced these capabilities. Google began incorporating similar image and audio features to those offered by the new GPT-4 into some versions of its LLM-powered chatbot, Bard, back in May. Meta, too, announced big strides in multimodality this past spring. Though it is in its infancy, the burgeoning technology can perform a variety of tasks.\nScientific American tested out two different chatbots that rely on multimodal LLMs: a version of ChatGPT powered by the updated GPT-4 (dubbed GPT-4 with vision, or GPT-4V) and Bard, which is currently powered by Google’s PaLM 2 model. Both can both hold hands-free vocal conversations using only audio, and they can describe scenes within images and decipher lines of text in a picture.\nThese abilities have myriad applications. In our test, using only a photograph of a receipt and a two-line prompt, ChatGPT accurately split a complicated bar tab and calculated the amount owed for each of four different people—including tip and tax. Altogether, the task took less than 30 seconds. Bard did nearly as well, but it interpreted one “9” as a “0,” thus flubbing the final total. In another trial, when given a photograph of a stocked bookshelf, both chatbots offered detailed descriptions of the hypothetical owner’s supposed character and interests that were almost like AI-generated horoscopes. Both identified the Statue of Liberty from a single photograph, deduced that the image was snapped from an office in lower Manhattan and offered spot-on directions from the photographer’s original location to the landmark (though ChatGPT’s guidance was more detailed than Bard’s). And ChatGPT also outperformed Bard in accurately identifying insects from photographs.\nFor disabled communities, the applications of such tech are particularly exciting. In March OpenAI started testing its multimodal version of GPT-4 through the company Be My Eyes, which provides a free description service through an app of the same name for blind and low-sighted people. The early trials went well enough that Be My Eyes is now in the process rolling out the AI-powered version of its app to all its users. “We are getting such exceptional feedback,” says Jesper Hvirring Henriksen, chief technology officer of Be My Eyes. At first there were lots of obvious issues, such as poorly transcribed text or inaccurate descriptions containing AI hallucinations. Henriksen says that OpenAI has improved on those initial shortcomings, however—errors are still present but less common. As a result, “people are talking about regaining their independence,” he says.\nIn this new wave of chatbots, the tools go beyond words. Yet they’re still based around artificial intelligence models that were built on language. How is that possible? Although individual companies are reluctant to share the exact underpinnings of their models, these corporations aren’t the only groups working on multimodal artificial intelligence. Other AI researchers have a pretty good sense of what’s happening behind the scenes.\nThere are two primary ways to get from a text-only LLM to an AI that also responds to visual and audio prompts, says Douwe Kiela, an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he teaches courses on machine learning, and CEO of the company Contextual AI. In the more basic method, Kiela explains, AI models are essentially stacked on top of one another. A user inputs an image into a chatbot, but the picture is filtered through a separate AI that was built explicitly to spit out detailed image captions. (Google has had algorithms like this for years.) Then that text description is fed back to the chatbot, which responds to the translated prompt.\nIn contrast, “the other way is to have a much tighter coupling,” Kiela says. Computer engineers can insert segments of one AI algorithm into another by combining the computer code infrastructure that underlies each model. According to Kiela, it’s “sort of like grafting one part of a tree onto another trunk.” From there, the grafted model is retrained on a multimedia data set—including pictures, images with captions and text descriptions alone—until the AI has absorbed enough patterns to accurately link visual representations and words together. It’s more resource-intensive than the first strategy, but it can yield an even more capable AI. Kiela theorizes that Google used the first method with Bard, while OpenAI may have relied on the second to create GPT-4. This idea potentially accounts for the differences in functionality between the two models.\nRegardless of how developers fuse their different AI models together, under the hood, the same general process is occurring. LLMs function on the basic principle of predicting the next word or syllable in a phrase. To do that, they rely on a “transformer” architecture (the “T” in GPT). This type of neural network takes something such as a written sentence and turns it into a series of mathematical relationships that are expressed as vectors, says Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. To a transformer neural net, a sentence isn’t just a string of words—it’s a web of connections that map out context. This gives rise to much more humanlike bots that can grapple with multiple meanings, follow grammatical rules and imitate style. To combine or stack AI models, the algorithms have to transform different inputs (be they visual, audio or text) into the same type of vector data on the path to an output. In a way, it’s taking two sets of code and “teaching them to talk to each other,” Salakhutdinov says. In turn, human users can talk to these bots in new ways.\nMany researchers view the present moment as the start of what’s possible. Once you begin aligning, integrating and improving different types of AI together, rapid advances are bound to keep coming. Kiela envisions a near future where machine learning models can easily respond to, analyze and generate videos or even smells. Salakhutdinov suspects that “in the next five to 10 years, you’re just going to have your personal AI assistant.” Such a program would be able to navigate everything from full customer service phone calls to complex research tasks after receiving just a short prompt.\nMultimodal AI is not the same as artificial general intelligence, a holy grail goalpost of machine learning wherein computer models surpass human intellect and capacity. Multimodal AI is an “important step” toward it, however, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University. Humans have an interwoven array of senses through which we understand the world. Presumably, to reach general AI, a computer would need the same.\nAs impressive and exciting as they are, multimodal models have many of the same problems as their singly focused predecessors, Zou says. “The one big challenge is the problem of hallucination,” he notes. How can we trust an AI assistant if it might falsify information at any moment? Then there’s the question of privacy. With information-dense inputs such as voice and visuals, even more sensitive information might inadvertently be fed to bots and then regurgitated in leaks or compromised in hacks.\nZou still advises people to try out these tools—carefully. “It’s probably not a good idea to put your medical records directly into the chatbot,” he says.\nLauren Leffer is a tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

{"title": "Nobel Prize Debate Misses the Mark on the Real Culprits Ignoring Scientific Merit", "date": "2023-10-05 15:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThe furor over a Nobel Prize winner’s derailed career lets scientists off the hook for their own responsibilities to fix a broken academic reward system\nNobel Prize announcements have become our own little nerd Super Bowl, an Academy Awards for the pocket-protector crowd. They are the subject of prediction markets and office pools, debated over teatime and happy hour. We ask, what will win: quantum dots, or protein folding? For one week during the year, we are all experts on what breakthroughs warrant our attention.\nAt best, these conversations are fun, even insightful—teachers often discard their syllabi for a day to discuss the technical advances behind the discoveries, and their wider implications. But less productive exchanges also persist, exemplified by the furor over the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology, given to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, for their discoveries that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID.\nReactions to the announcement erupted moments after the prize was announced, much of it focusing on the story behind Karikó’s dismissal from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. This response highlights how criticisms of the Nobel Prize continue to miss the mark, and are often obscured by scapegoating, moral superiority, and public posturing. What we need instead are deeper, more uncomfortable conversations about innovation, inclusion, and merit.\nNobel announcement disagreements often focus on whether the recipients deserved it, or not. But the 2023 Medicine and Physiology prize has received near universal applause: the science that it rewards has already saved the lives of many millions, and (maybe most importantly) has transformed how we think about emerging infectious diseases and other diseases. But the real intrigue surrounds its backstory. Karikó was forced to retire from her position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. The much-discussed reasons are familiar villains: the inability to secure major grant funding from the large agencies, and other markers of success in the biomedicine machine.\nThe news has spawned a necessary community reflection. Some suggest that our instruments for evaluating science are hopelessly broken in academia. Relatedly, those in biotech emphasize that the work demonstrates how private industry can deliver important discovery at a speed that academia cannot. Others highlight the role of sexism, where women in science are rarely respected when it comes to intrepid ideas. In the face of this, some suggest specific interventions: that the University of Pennsylvania should apologize, or at least not take credit for the achievement, as “they” (the school or it’s officials) devalued her work. All these arguments are well-intentioned but are festooned with contradictions.\nFirst, there is the notion that the Nobel Prize equals vindication. Consider the contradiction. We are frustrated that Karikó was misjudged by a room full of people at a prestigious institution, the University of Pennsylvania. And yet, we celebrate her receiving a positive judgement from a room full of people at a prestigious institution, the Nobel Committee (notably, few know how either works). This cognitive dissonance tells us to like the subjective processes that give us the outcome that we want, and to dislike the equally subjective ones that don’t. Instead, we could be equally critical of both.  \nThis relates to the second problem: we ignore our collective complicity in a system that offers rewards based on dubious standards. For example, in identifying suitable graduate students or faculty, we have all almost surely missed out on worthy job candidates based on our own (even benign) preferences. One reason that we haven’t been held accountable for our poor decisions is that the people we denied haven’t (yet) won a Nobel Prize. The reality is even worse: our decisions probably prevented deserving scientists from ever having the chance.\nMy personal defense mechanism for overlooking? I conclude that they (the University of Pennsylvania in this case) were wrong for misjudging Karikó, but I’ve been fair and correct in all my own judgments. \nThis sort of hypocrisy is not only prevalent in science but is a near requirement, to make us feel better about the harm we might have caused. The more uncomfortable truth is that academic science has never been a trade that selects for or supports the best scientific minds in the world. Instead, it has been, and will be for the foreseeable future, an enterprise for smart people positioned within the right professional network, armed with vocabulary to make their ideas legible to influential scientists (not the public), who study things that are just interesting enough to not offend academic sensibilities. And many of us suspect that identities like gender and race (and others) can amplify the signals that trip those wires.\nIn my view, academic institutions are fairly transparent (though not enough) about the fact that the primary duty of their scientists is not to make the world better, but to develop a professional profile and raise funds. It is the job I signed up for, and I’ve reconciled this in the same way that I do with many institutions, say the U.S., with baggage: acknowledge the flaws, while leveraging the windows of privilege to do good. Hopefully, I can meaningfully change a thing or two about it in my lifetime. Thankfully, I’ve had dozens of remarkable mentors and friends who are doing just that, better than I ever could. \nBut it is the changing of a “thing or two” part where the do-gooder-rubber meets the selection-committee-road. I am certain about one thing: hurling invective at the University of Pennsylvania won’t fix academia’s flaws. Change only happens with personal reflection: how many students from nontraditional backgrounds have I ever advocated for? How often do I rely on credentials and proximity to power to make professional decisions? Do I rely on silly, hackable citation metrics to evaluate scientific impact? And how often does innovation truly factor into my evaluations of a scientist? \nThe questions make my heart hurt, mostly because I’m just another random scientist swimming against a tide that prefers that we all become fundraising automatons. In the meantime, I can draw inspiration from the lives of Nobel laureates. They contain thrilling tales of discovery, and lessons about creativity and resilience. The winners will be okay. Rather than hunting for villains in their stories, I’m better off using their inspiration and frustration to help find the next Frances Arnold, Carolyn Bertozzi, or Katalin Karikó, many struggling to find a way to participate in science.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nC.

{"title": "Vaccine Scientist Warns Antiscience Conspiracies Have Become a Deadly, Organized Movement", "date": "2023-10-05 15:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nVaccinologist Peter Hotez explains how the movement to oppose science and scientists has gained power\nPeter Hotez is no stranger to scientific backlash. The esteemed pediatrician and vaccinologist has been working to develop vaccines for neglected tropical diseases for decades and has encountered fierce opposition to his work. But in recent years the backlash has gained momentum and spread beyond vaccines to science and scientists in general.\nHotez, who is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, chronicles this movement in his new book The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science. The book traces Hotez’s experiences battling the false belief that vaccines cause autism (a condition that his daughter has), the highly partisan backlash to the COVID vaccines (a low-cost version of which Hotez and his colleagues helped develop) and the authoritarian roots of the antiscience movement.\nScientific American spoke with Hotez about the book, the experiences he’s had as a target of antiscience attacks and the things that should be done to combat such threats.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nWhy did you decide to write this book?\nI think one of the things the book does is: it helps connect a few dots. People call [the antiscience movement] “misinformation” or “the infodemic” as though it’s just random junk out there on the Internet or social media, and it’s not—it’s organized, it’s well-financed, and it’s politically motivated. It’s really its own ecosystem that’s doing a lot of damage to the country and to American science and scientists. And now it’s reached a new level. It’s become a lethal force. It’s the fact that [at least] 200,000 Americans needlessly perished [between June 2021 and March 2022] because they refused the COVID vaccine during the [Delta and Omicron COVID waves], and they were victims of this organized campaign.\nYour book discusses how the modern antiscience movement grew out of false claims in the late 1990s that vaccines cause autism, right?\nIn some ways, it’s a sequel to one of my previous books, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism. So, you know, I have a daughter who has autism. As you point out, the original assertion was that vaccines cause autism. And in the previous book, I detailed the evidence showing that there’s no link. So I’ve been in this for a while, confronting antivaccine groups. But what I saw starting about a decade ago was a shift—maybe because we were taking some of the wind out of their sails around autism, [the people in these groups] needed a new thing. And the new thing was to become part of the American political landscape and link themselves up initially to the Republican Tea Party, even before the pandemic, around this concept of health freedom, medical freedom. And that’s what came off the rails during COVID.\nWhy do you feel compelled to speak out now?\nI’ve been the number one or two target of that movement for years or decades. And now I have an insight into how this is unfolding. It troubles me that it’s not only targeting science but scientists. I think it’s undermining the country because we’re a nation built on science and technology and on the greatness of our research universities and institutions, and they are under threat. I felt compelled to be kind of the tip of the spear, to sound that warning, because we’re seeing mostly silence from our university presidents and from our scientific societies. Even the National Academies [of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine] weren’t really out there. I think there was a kind of hope that it would just go away on its own. But we’ve seen from past experience that this kind of stuff doesn’t go away on its own. It’s got to be confronted.\nAre you concerned that confronting anti-vaxxers and antiscience people will only give them more attention?\nThat was the response from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] back in 2017 when I wrote about how the anti-vaxxers are winning. We’re not supposed to talk about it, or we’ll give it oxygen. But it’s got all the oxygen it needs. You might say, “Well, why write it now?” For two reasons: one, it’s become a killer movement. Think about the 200,000 Americans who died because of this—that’s a major societal lethal force right up there with anything else we might be concerned about as a society. And the second is the attacks on the individual scientists and the portrayal of scientists as enemies of the state. This is unacceptable. I mean, this is undermining our national security.\nIt's absurd that the people who are trying to protect us all from this deadly disease are the ones who are being attacked for it.\nYeah. I mean, what’s my crime? I helped develop a low-cost COVID vaccine technology that reached 100 million people and provided a proof of concept that was an alternative to the big pharma companies. It’s really unfortunate. And I think it’s going to get worse as we head into the 2024 election.\nDo you think Donald Trump’s presidency influenced the rise of antiscience attitudes?\nWhat’s happening now, I say in the book at the beginning, is actually not about Trump. Most of this got worse after Trump in 2021 to 2022. Now there’s this effort to rewrite history—maybe in part because I’ve called [antiscience politicians and influencers] out by saying 200,000 Americans died because of their disinformation campaign. They’re doubling down and trying to say, “No, it was the COVID vaccine that killed Americans, and the scientists made the COVID virus.” This revisionist history is playing out now with the [U.S. House of Representatives] hearings that we’re seeing in the [Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic], which are trying to parade prominent scientists in front of C-SPAN cameras to try to humiliate them. It’s very Stalin-like, very [similar to the] U.S.S.R. in the 1930s.\nThat’s an interesting analogy because the far right and the anti-vax movement have compared COVID vaccination efforts to the Nazis’ treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust.\nIt’s totally offensive, right? I mean, trying to draw parallels between vaccinations and the Holocaust, and the heavy use of Nazi imagery—that, too, is a form of antisemitism. So there are a lot of antisemitic undercurrents. And [those making the comparisons] know I’m Jewish, so that’s also a component.\nDo you think that anti-vax and antisemitic groups overlap and strengthen each other?\nIn the Venn diagram, there’s not a complete overlap between the circles, but there’s definitely overlap. There’s a history to that too. People called what Einstein and Freud did “Jewish science,” so there’s that modern history of linking antiscience to antisemitism.\nThe big issue then is: Where do we go from here, now that we’ve got this sort of entire well-oiled, well-financed antiscience ecosystem? How do we begin addressing it and chipping away at it? That was one of the hardest things for me to get my arms around. What do you do? Because it’s a political movement. The scientific societies and national academies don’t want to talk about it because it takes them into an unpleasant place. I don’t like talking about it either. But you have to report it and describe it so you know what you’re dealing with because maybe it'll autocorrect eventually. But right now, it’s not going away.\nIn the book you also talk about how the U.S. is exporting anti-vax and antiscience sentiment around the world.\nThis is coming out of the authoritarian playbook, with devastating consequences. We’re seeing it not only in the U.S. but also in Brazil with [former president Jair Bolsonaro’s] regime or with [Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán in Hungary. This is part of how authoritarian regimes operate: you denigrate science and scientists.\nI think we’re seeing more of the globalization of what’s happening in the U.S. A lot of it’s not in the biomedical literature. It’s in local newspapers and that sort of thing. But there are enough pieces there that make me believe that this is certainly contaminating Canada and also Germany and Austria and France to some extent—and low- and middle-income countries as well. I think this is going to start affecting all immunizations, including childhood immunizations globally. I’m worried about measles and polio coming back.\nWhat’s happening now with the antiscience movement here in the U.S.?\nI worry about what’s going to happen as we head into the 2024 election. I worry about these House hearings—I think they’re going to ratchet up, and they’re going to continue to target scientists. I worry about what’s going on with some members of the Senate and the rhetoric coming out of the [presidential] campaign. I mean, you already have two prominent antivaccine activists running for president—Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Ron DeSantis. What’s so chilling is that these are state-sanctioned attacks on science and scientists.\nYou’ve personally experienced some very threatening attacks and even physical confrontations. How do you deal with that?\nThese are multimodality attacks: it’s the threatening e-mails; it’s the stuff on social media. And Twitter’s gotten so awful in the past year that it’s just almost untenable. And then, you know, [people are] stalking me when I speak at scientific conferences or outside my home recently, so it is getting very, very troubling.\nWhat can be done to combat antiscience attitudes and support science and scientists?\nI don’t think the community of scientists by itself can solve this. We’re going to need help, both from the White House and the United Nations because this is now a politically motivated assault. So we need the White House, for instance, to treat this like any politically motivated attack on the country, whether it’s a cyberattack or global terrorism or nuclear proliferation.\nThe first step is bringing in people from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice and the Department of State because of the role of Russia in amplifying the discord. I think we need an interagency task force [in the U.S.] and the same at the U.N. I don’t think the World Health Organization can solve this problem. I think this needs to go to the attention of the U.N. General Assembly and maybe the Security Council and NATO, perhaps, because it is a security threat, and it undermines democracies and the security of countries.\nTanya Lewis is a senior editor covering health and medicine at Scientific American.

{"title": "Should You Wake Someone from the Throes of a Nightmare?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:40:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNightmares are unpleasant, but waking someone in the midst of one isn’t the best way to handle them—here’s why\nYour bedmate is whimpering in their sleep and perhaps thrashing about. It looks like a nightmare. Should you wake them?\nNope, experts say. As terrible as whatever visions that are running through their head might be, waking someone from a nightmare is more likely to ensure that they’ll remember the bad dream. And if someone appears physically distressed in their sleep like this, it’s more likely that they’re having a night terror than a nightmare; night terrors are different neurological experiences.\nNightmares are a normal part of dreaming, says Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of The Committee of Sleep (Oneiroi Press, 2001). They almost always happen in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep marked by brain activity that looks very similar to that of an awake brain.\n“Except for being scary, they look like every other dream,” Barrett says.\nDuring REM sleep, the brain areas responsible for long-term memory storage show altered activation, so people don’t tend to remember their nightmares unless those sleep tales are scary enough to wake them up. Once a dreamer awakens, their long-term memory regions come back on line. Most of the time, someone having a nightmare will be indistinguishable from a peaceful dreamer. During a nightmare, heart rate increases by seven beats per minute on average, says Michael Schredl, a dream and sleep researcher at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Germany. Otherwise the sleeper typically lies still in bed: during REM sleep, muscles are paralyzed, which keeps people from acting out their dreams.\nIf someone is moving around, talking in their sleep or sleepwalking while appearing distressed, it’s more likely a night terror, which occurs during non-REM sleep, Schredl says.\nNight terrors are particularly common among kids, says Leslie Ellis, a clinical counselor in British Columbia who treats patients with nightmares. “You shouldn’t wake them up because they’ll be disoriented,” Ellis says. “They won’t have any recollection of the episode if you don’t wake them up.”\nNightmares can be echoes of the stressful experiences people are having in their waking hours. During the early days of the COVID pandemic, people reported more nightmares, according to several studies on the topic. New themes also emerged, according to research published in the journal Somnologie in 2022, including those about sickness, confinement and bugs—the latter subject is perhaps a symbol of infection or contamination.\nPeople also sometimes seemed to be working through the new rules of the pandemic, says Anu-Katriina Pesonen, a psychological researcher at the University of Helsinki, who documented dream changes that occurred in early 2020. “The dreams were often reexperiences of new behavioral rules,” Pesonen says. “For example, hand shaking in a dream was vividly experienced as a major mistake. This could assist in learning new norms.”\nThe occasional scary dream is nothing to worry about, but frequent nightmares can sometimes be part of a larger psychological disorder. The good news, Barrett and Ellis say, is that these nightmares are remarkably treatable. The people who have the most trouble with nightmares, Barrett says, have often experienced trauma. They may relive their traumatic experiences, sometimes with the addition of even darker fears. These nightmares are often so alarming that they interrupt the person’s healing.\n“I’ve never heard anyone say they don’t mind having PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] nightmares much. They say things like, ‘It’s like having the trauma happen again, night after night,’” Barrett says.\nSome of these trauma-related nightmares can occur outside of REM sleep, Barrett says, suggesting that they’re more like PTSD flashbacks than like regular dreams. Waking someone from these nightmares isn’t a long-term solution, but people having them can be coached to take control of the dreams. There are different ways to do this. Some psychologists and counselors will simply talk a person through possible alternative endings for a nightmare. This can be anything from a magical rescue to the person saving themselves. In her practice, Ellis has patients relax into a sort of daydream where they rewrite the circumstances of the bad dream while making sure they feel safe and comfortable.\nIn a 2020 meta-analysis of studies, researchers found that this treatment, called “imagery rehearsal therapy,” was likely as effective as medications for ending post-traumatic nightmares. Anecdotally, the method can also work for repeated nightmares, or bad dreams that recur, sometimes for years.\n“I’ve worked with people who had the same dream for decades, but now the dream is different, or sometimes it doesn’t come back,” Ellis says.\nIt’s possible to try imagery rehearsal therapy on yourself, Ellis says. But, she adds, if your nightmares are particularly persistent or distressing, or if they’re the result of trauma, it’s best to seek professional help.\nStephanie Pappas is a freelance science journalist.

{"title": "A Chance Discovery Uncovered the Remarkable Life of One of the First Female Oceanographers", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nEight pages hidden in an archive led to the discovery of the story of Christine Essenberg\nChristine Essenberg had an unusual life and career trajectory. She was married, then divorced and earned her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of California, Berkeley, at age 41. She went on to become one of the early researchers at what is now the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. We know the story of Christine Essenberg only because of a serendipitous find.\nWhile searching in an archive jammed with the papers of male scientists, host Katie Hafner came across a slim folder, called “Folder 29,” in the back of a box at the University of California, San Diego, Library’s Special Collections & Archives. There were just eight pages inside to use as a jumping-off point to flesh out a life, which raises the question: How many other unknown women in science are out there, hidden away in boxes? \nThis is Christine Essenberg’s journey from researcher to teacher. It’s the first discovery of what we’re calling the Folder 29 Project, a research initiative to uncover the work of lost women of science, hidden in the archives of universities across the country.\nLISTEN TO THE PODCAST\n\n[New to this season of Lost Women of Science? Listen to Episode One here first, then Episode Two, then Episode Three.]\nLost Women of Science is produced for the ear. Where possible, we recommend listening to the audio for the most accurate representation of what was said.\nEPISODE TRANSCRIPT\nLynda Claassen: How much there is to be done, and how little one knows. Yours respectfully, Christine Essenberg.\nKatie Hafner: That's the closing line of a letter that zoologist Christine Essenberg sent to her boss a century ago. \nI'm Katie Hafner, and this is Lost Women of Science.\nA while back, I was poring over papers of a renowned scientist at UC San Diego when suddenly, an accidental discovery. At the very back of a box, there was this. Folder 29. Eight pages of paper. Two letters, written to a Dr. Ritter in 1921 from a Christine Essenberg, and a single letter the following year 1922. There, in fine cursive Essenberg worries about how to help her dying sister back in Switzerland. She considers becoming a school teacher, noting the pay is better. She politely inquires, asking when her research will finally get published. Most intriguing to me: in one letter, she appears to chuck it all and head off to Constantinople. \nWhat? Who? Who was this, and what’s she doing buried in this box? These poignant letters, fragments of a life, survived only because they were part of another scientist's archival collection. Which makes me think, just how many Folder 29s are there out there in archives just like this?\nFolder 29, lost in the back of an archive, haunted me for months. And so I sent producer Claire Trageser back to the UC San Diego archive to dig a little deeper. \nClaire Trageser: Hi. Welcome. Are you Lynda?\nI'm Claire.\nNice to meet you. Nice to meet you. \nClaire Trageser: I made an appointment with Lynda Claassen, the longtime director of Special Collections and Archives. And she has set aside time to delve deeper into Folder 29.\nLynda Claassen: And I only have until 12:25. I'm sorry.\nClaire Trageser: She has set a standard cardboard archive box on the table, labeled box five. It contains the collected papers of Carl Eckart, a geophysicist who Katie was looking into a while back. And Katie's right about this mystery folder. \nLynda Claassen: Eckart. Eckart Ecker. Remind me what we're looking for. What's her last name? \nClaire Trageser: Essenberg.\nLynda Claassen: Oh, of course it's the last folder in this box.\nClaire Trageser: Linda pulls the folder out and the first thing she notices is the swirling cursive on parchment paper. \nLynda Claassen: How wonderful. These wonderfully polite, nice letters that people used to write on paper in, in nice, neat handwriting \nClaire Trageser: It's a letter dated June 18, 1917 to Christine Essenberg. She has just earned her PhD in Zoology, and is working at what is now Scripps Institution of Oceanography on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in La Jolla, California. She has a passion for research, and is also assisting at the institute’s small library. Lynda Claassen leans in for a closer look.\nLynda Claassen: Let's see. Thank you for your note. And yeah, \nClair Trageser: Can you read it a little bit or just shall I read it? \nLynda Claasen: Yeah, sure. \nClaire Trageser: That'd be great. \nThe letter is from The Academy of Natural Sciences and gives a sense of the kinds of mundane tasks that she did at the library. It seems that she had flagged a missing periodical. And here is the response written to her, all dry and formal.\nLynda Claassen: My Dear Mrs. Essenberg, I thank you for your note regarding the institution’s subscriptions. \nClaire Trageser: And the note goes on to say it was a misunderstanding on the part of the mailing clerk and the error has been corrected. So she was dealing with minutiae, settling up back issues of a journal. It's a far cry from the field research she craved. At least, that's our guess. We only have these eight pages of letters to go on. Just eight pages to try to understand the story of a life.\nAnd that's the point of this project. There are probably so many women like Essenberg, just waiting to be discovered. Each with a unique story, women battling to do their own research in a man's world. \nWe only stumbled on Essenberg because Katie happened to find her letters tucked away in the back of a box.\nSo now our quest is to try to find out as much as we can about Essenberg, with these eight pages as our jumping off point.\nThis much we know. Christine Essenberg came to San Diego after earning her Master's and then in 1917 completing her PhD from U-C Berkeley. Her doctoral thesis was a mouthful, titled “The Factors Controlling the Distribution of the Polynoidae on the Pacific Coast” We’ve since come to learn that Polynoidae are scaly worms that live in the ocean.\nHow did she arrive at this very specific topic? \nWell, for one, many of the early scientists like Christine Essenberg, studying at UC Berkeley, were Zoologists.\nProfessor Joseph LeConte established the department in 1887.\nThen zoology was taken over by William Ritter, who eventually went south to San Diego and established the Marine Biological Association, which became Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nAnd, more importantly, it appears that both LeConte and Ritter took a special interest in mentoring women, and helping them progress in their scientific careers.\nRitter was married to a physician, who may have influenced his views on women, or perhaps he went into the marriage fully formed as a man ahead of his time. \nWhat we do know is that the newlyweds were an adventurous pair. On their honeymoon, they went to a southern point in San Diego to collect goby fish specimens. We know that their boat capsized, and they had to be rescued.\nWilliam Ritter was Christine Essenberg's boss, and the next letter is written by Essenberg to Ritter in May of 1921, four years after she received her PhD. \nArchivist Lynda Claassen reads from it.\nLynda Claassen: Have you thought about, or have you found out anything about the publication of my appendices or copelata work?\nClaire Trageser: So her research has moved from the scaly worm to the species of plankton . Clearly, the ocean is influencing her. As the letter continues, she's looking ahead, thinking about the next steps in her career \nLynda Claassen: I would like to do some experimental work on the side, so as not to be obliged to sit at the microscope all the time.\nClaire Trageser: Remember, this is 1921. Women had just won the right to vote a year earlier. Very few had careers at all. And so Essenberg was battling not just the idea that she should be working, but that she should be doing the type of work she liked. \nIn this sobering letter, she's surprisingly candid with Ritter. It's clear that she is depending on him both for financial and emotional support. \nLynda Claassen: My sister is sick in Switzerland now. In case she should die, I shall go after her child and raise her. \nKatie Hafner: Amazing. right? Yes. \nClaire Trageser: Katie has been listening in on her cell, following along as we go through the letters. \nWhat we're gleaning from them is that this is a woman determined to make her way in the world as a scientist, but with few prospects despite her PhD. \nNot to mention a very ill sister, with thousands of miles separating them. \nAnd a boss who likely had more pressing concerns than Essenberg's troubles. In her letter, she notes her research would take \"years and years of patient study.\" That would be impossible to set aside once it's started, making it difficult, she writes, to fulfill obligations, both to herself and to her family. Essenberg then makes a not-so-subtle case for better pay. \nLynda Claassen: I may be obliged to go to teaching where I can earn more in nine month’s work. The beginning salary of grammar school teachers is $1,500. It is only fair that I should expect at least similar salary especially when I am under obligations to help my people. It would be selfish of me to follow my dreams and leave them to suffer and die. \nClaire Trageser: It seems Essenberg was treading a thin line with her boss, asserting herself, but not being too assertive. \nLynda Claassen: I am sorry to disturb you with my tales of woe, but you will understand better my attitude and my lack of definitive decision. I hope not to disturb you again in the future. Yours respectfully, Christine Essenberg. \nClaire Trageser: By the end of the year, Essenberg is taking a new tack. In December of 1921 she proposes a one-year leave of absence that will take her to research labs across the globe, and -- likely not incidentally -- within striking distance of her ailing sister in Switzerland. Three months later, in March of 1922, her travel plans are approved. The letter from the President of the University of California is not addressed to her, Dr. Essenberg, but to her boss, Dr. Ritter. It grants \"Mrs\" Christine Essenberg, a one year leave of absence starting that summer, July of 1922 and ending June of 1923.  \nLynda Claassen: Without salary, of course. \nKatie Hafner: What, what did you say, \nLynda Claassen: She's being granted leave, but without salary. \nKatie Hafner: Wow. So how did she support herself during this year, I wonder. \nClaire Trageser: What we do know is that, about two months into her unpaid leave, Essenberg wrote from the most unexpected of places.\nLynda Claassen: A letter in September of 1922 from Christine to Dr. Ritter. \nKatie Hafner: And where's she writing from? \nLynda Claassen: The Constantinople Women's College. In Constantinople, Turkey.  \nKatie Hafner: Wow. How did she get there? How did that happen?\nClaire Trageser: Indeed she was teaching at The Constantinople Women's College. It makes sense. If she stuck with her plan, Dr. Essenberg spent the first two months of her leave traveling to various marine labs. Perhaps she followed through and visited her ailing sister in Switzerland. But remember: It was an unpaid leave. By that fall of 1922 she could very well have exhausted her savings. So teaching, which she earlier noted was more lucrative than her Scripps job, made sense. A teaching position at the Constantinople Women's College would keep her afloat. And it turned her life in an entirely new direction, one she chose for herself. She picked a heady time to be in Constantinople. On the heels of World War One, there was a lot of instability and she walked right into The Turkish War of Independence. But, given what she writes next, she seems undaunted.\nLynda Claassen: I am not the least bit nervous or afraid. Neither does anybody else here at the college pay much attention to the political affairs. . .until the British officers are leaving Constantinople. \nClaire Trageser: Despite the chaos all around her, Essenberg presses on for recognition in her field. \nLynda Claassen: Then she has a paragraph: I hope my paper has gone to print. I sent a brief paper to Mrs. Genter, asking her to hand it over to you. If you find it worthwhile publishing, you will kindly send it to the press. \nClaire Trageser: With a war swirling around her, she updates Ritter in September of 1922, writing about how, despite the chaos, her students are still showing up for her class, and she frets about their future. \nLynda Claassen: I feel sorry for them. After they finish their college, they are discontented with their home life. According to their customs and traditions, there was very little of wholesome pleasures left for the Turkish woman. She's not supposed to do any work either at home nor in public, nor is there any intellectual or social life for her.\nKatie Hafner: Oh, wow. \nLynda Claassen: Right. Some of the women -- and I think she means all of the women in the college, not just the Turkish women -- some of the women are very capable and they are all charming. The education here is making a great influence on the women and will gradually change their position. The change is already noticeable in Constantinople. The girls here suffer a great deal on account of the war rumors and feel as if they had to apologize for some of the actions of their nation. \nClaire Trageser: How would we even know of Essenberg's struggles and triumphs if her letters had not been included in that archival box of papers? Surely there are countless other women like her. To find out about these kinds of lost women, we called MIT where there is another relatively new initiative to recover the lost women. Archivist Thera Webb is working on it. \nThera Webb: I believe it started around 2016 when one of the archivists at that time had been advocating for a focus on collecting the papers of women faculty. \nClaire Trageser: She says one of the big challenges in tracking down women is that they are more likely to change their names when they get married, so she relies heavily on their maiden names.\nThera Webb: There will be like, a folder titled Mr. and Mrs. John C. Smith. And then you're like, oh, okay, well who is Mrs. John C. Smith? And so there's a lot of research being done by archivists and interns, that's sort of tied to genealogy in that we're like tracing back to get to the birth name of these women who are in our collections. There was a folder for Mr. and Mrs. Williams C. Russo. And what I learned was that Mrs. Williams C. Russo was actually Margaret Hutchinson Russo PhD, who was an engineer who designed the first commercial penicillin production plant and was the first woman to become a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. But I never would've known that from the name on the folder.\nClaire Trageser: But more broadly, it's a challenge, Webb says, because artifacts from the lives of women in science are typically not as valued.\nThera Webb: Maybe somebody held onto all of the papers of some woman, but they were never accepted by a repository as a collection that people were interested in. So sometimes it is really the case where you can only sort of piece together bits and pieces in collections that belong to men. \nClaire Trageser: Webb says the movement to find and archive the papers of women scientists is just gaining steam. There's more attention to women's contributions and still a lot out there to be found. \nThera Webb: Whether they're at a repository right now at a university or a historical society or in someone's shoebox under their bed, the letters of their great-grandmother who happened to be a scientist, but at this moment, if you don't know what you're looking for, you won't be able to find it. And we don't know what we're looking for a hundred percent of the time.\nClaire Trageser: MIT is one of several schools plumbing their archives. At UC Berkeley, the search is also on to document the working lives of women who have worked there. \nThere, Sheila Humphreys, an emeritus engineering professor at UC Berkeley, has thrown herself into the research. She's very no-nonsense. She wanted to know right away how I'd become interested in the idea of lost women. \nIt's kind of like the jumping off point is a couple letters from a woman scientist in San Diego at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nSheila Humphreys: But what was her name? \nClaire Trageser: Uh, Christine Essenberg. \nSheila Humphreys: Oh my God, I've, I've researched her for months. I have a whole essay about her. \nClaire Trageser: Oh wow. Okay, great.\nWhat were the odds? What luck! Serendipity had taken me directly to a Christine Essenberg expert! \nAnd she has plenty to say. \nJust ahead…\nDominique Janee: Hi. I’m Dominique Janee, an Associate Producer at Lost Women of Science. We don’t know how many Folder 29’s are out there buried in archives around the world. But we’re guessing there are a lot of them. If you’re interested in helping us with our Folder 29 Project, an ambitious dig through archives, looking for lost scientists like Christine Essenberg, go to lostwomenofscience.org to find out more. \nSheila Humphreys: You, you know, she has the most fascinating, strange story.\nClaire Trageser: That's Professor Emeritus Sheila Humphreys of UC Berkeley, talking about Christine Essenberg. Over a century ago, Essenberg was an early research scientist at what is now the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Humphreys told me that she had researched Essenberg, along with many other early female scientists. She wrote a 168 page essay about these women, so I asked her to send it over. Then, with essay in hand, Katie and I started scrolling through the details of Essenberg's life. \nKatie Hafner: This is quite a find. \nClaire Trageser: This says she was known for her expertise in plankton, which we kind of…\nKatie Hafner:  … figured out. \nClaire Trageser:. Yes. \nKatie Hafner: Right.\nClaire Trageser: She's, born of Swedish parents, which we had sort of had some inkling of, right? \nKatie Hafner: Uh-huh. \nClaire Trageser: Essenberg had a whole life before coming to the United States. She had been teaching for several years in St. Petersburg in Russia, but once in the U.S. went to Indiana, to Valparaiso University where she studied zoology and botany.\nClaire Trageser: And she got married before she graduated, and then later divorced. Interesting. \nKatie Hafner: Was the husband Essenberg, or was her maiden name Essenberg? \nClaire Trageser: Her maiden name was Adamson, and her husband's name was Essenberg. She got divorced, but I don't know if she, maybe she kept Essenberg or, um mm-hmm. \nor just the, what? The letters from the time that we had, she was still married. It doesn't say when she got divorced.\nClaire Trageser with Katie Hafner: She's, oh my God. There's her picture. Where? She looks so different from what I thought she would look like. Um, and this photo of her is just with the broach and she looks , she looks young, This is amazing.\nClaire Trasgeser: The more we pore over in the essay, the more questions we have. So we go right to the source herself: Sheila Humphreys, who had compiled all of this information. But first we had to ask her: What was it about Essenberg that caught your eye? Humphreys had a quick and simple answer.\nSheila Humphreys: The reason that Christine Essenberg came to my attention was that She was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. She was the sixth woman to get a PhD in Zoology, so she was very, very early, and that's why she's one of those women that I profiled.\nClaire Trageser: Humphreys explained that, in an effort to rediscover lost women scientists, each department at UC Berkeley was asked to compile a history of women in their disciplines.\nSheila Humphreys: In the case of oceanography in which Christine Essenberg belongs, she was originally a student in the Department of Zoology, which was one of the first departments established at Berkeley. It was taught from the very beginning. \nClaire Trageser: So...you'd think there'd be plenty of documentation, but you'd be wrong. The search for Esssenberg was complicated. Departments had consolidated over the years. Humphreys says 23 departments were merged into three, so Zoology, Essenberg's specialty, essentially disappeared. There was little institutional memory of her. \nSheila Humphreys: And that's how I personally came to know Christine because I decided to fill the gap that I would take this on. \nClaire Trageser: Sheila Humpreys says that, in researching Essenberg, she learned a lot about the early years of Scripps itself. \nBack in Essenberg's day a century ago, the lab was in its infancy and working conditions brought men and women together under very rudimentary conditions. \nSheila Humphreys: They had a temporary lab, they had set up tents and they had one boat and they camped over the summer. And indeed these early women who did their research there, once they went off to teach at various places like Wellesley College, they would come back in the summer to continue their research under Dr. Ritter.\nClaire Trageser: And come back they did. The less-than-optimal conditions required the kind of close cooperation that encourages collegiality.\nSheila Humphreys: And I attribute, and I think others do too, some of their success to the fact that it was a very congenial colony of people. And Ritter's wife Mary Bennett Ritter was the physician to women's students, but she went down with her husband to help establish this marine biology lab, and she was a trusted maternal presence and advisor and friend to some of these women.\nClaire Trageser: Humphreys says the mutual respect that was nurtured helped to break down barriers.\nSheila Humphreys: These women, even though they were probably the single woman in their cohort, they do not talk about feeling discriminated against or that there was any kind of resentment of them at all. It was a very, seems like a pretty happy place where they had Saturday night suppers of clam chowder on the beach and uh, there was even a small school for people who had families, but anyway, that's how I got to Christine Essenberg.\nClaire Trageser: It all sounded pretty idyllic, but Humphreys says it wasn't always that way. From Essenberg's letters to Ritter, while men in her cohort are moving ahead, it seems she has stalled out. It was a constant push to get her research published. \nSo it didn't seem so far-fetched that she would make good on her veiled threat to take a teaching job for better pay, especially when she saw the war-time need for science teachers at that all women's college in Constantinople. Opening up the world to her students only to see the walls close in on them later when they left, was something she struggled with.\nSheila Humphreys: She talks about what a prison these girls would be in, especially the Turkish girls. After they finished their education, they were not supposed to do any work outside the home. In fact, they were barely meant to leave the home. \nClaire Trageser: And she didn't worry only about her students.\nSheila Humphreys:  There's reference to her creating a, a program for their mothers to come and do, I think physical education using the school building. Overall she wanted to, to educate them and to liberate them.\nClaire Trageser: So it's clear that teaching at the school in Constantinople was really eye-opening for Christine Essenberg. Still, we do know that she ultimately left the Women's College there. But Katie, guess where she went next. \nKatie Hafner: Back home to the United States?\nClaire Trageser: No. Or at least not for long. She went to Damascus, Syria. To start a school of her own. The American School for Girls opened in the fall of 1925.\nKatie Hafner: Oh! Damascus! Did she succeed? Did she make a go of it?\nClaire Trageser: Yes! Yes, the school was unique. It admitted not just Muslim students, but there were some Jewish students and Christians too, according to Sheila Humphreys.\nSheila Humphreys:  This school was very well known at the time, and she had very well known scientists on the board, you know, people from Harvard and all over the place. \nClaire Trageser: People like the Harvard Astronomer Harlow Shapley, who served on her board. \nKatie Hafner: Harlow Shapley? Oh my gosh! He was featured prominently in an earlier Lost Women of Science episode, the one about Astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin. So Payne-Gaposchkin worked for him at Harvard.\nClaire Trageser: Yeah, that’s right! And we know that, two decades after its founding, during World War Two, the doors of The American School for Girls stayed open. Even during the bombardment of Damascus in 1945, Christine Essenberg did not leave her post. \nSheila Humphreys: And she stayed there and it was bombed. And her school was sort of a center for expatriates who were stuck there.\nClaire Trageser: And not just a center. Humphreys says Christine Essenberg allowed part of her school to be used by the Allied soldiers. \nKatie Hafner: Did her school survive the war?\nClaire Trageser: We know that the year after the war ended, 1946, Shapley from Harvard was chairman of the board of her school. And we know that in subsequent years, Christine Essenberg made multiple trips back to the United States to drum up financial support for her school. \nShe appealed for donors coast-to-coast. There's a local newspaper in New Jersey that talks about one of her fundraising visits, and The San Francisco Examiner noted her stop there to gather support in 1947. By then she was 71 years old. And when questioned about creeping Orientalism, as it was referred to at the time – efforts to teach western values, Christian values – she's quoted as telling a reporter, \"It was never my purpose to endeavor to 'westernize' these girls. My primary objective,\" she said, \"is to educate.\"\nBut Katie. That's pretty much where the trail grows cold. \nWe do know she ultimately did return to California at the end of her life. She spent her final years in San Francisco and died in 1965 when she would have been about 89 years old.\nKatie Hafner: Well, but, do we know whether she ever did get published? I mean, that seemed to have been a recurring sore spot for her in all the letters she wrote back in the 1920s.\nClaire Trageser: Yes, she did. We found at least nine papers from early on. But by the time her last papers were getting published, she was already teaching abroad. Teaching science. To girls and women.\nKatie Hafner: So, this much we do know. Christine Essenberg came to the United States. She ended up in California by way of Indiana as an older student, apparently with a marriage and a divorce thrown in. She got her PhD at 41, becoming one of the early researchers at what is now called The Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nBut in the end, snippets from her letters tell the story of a female scientist who carved out a niche for herself in the most traditional of all women's professions: teaching school. \nClaire Trageser: So maybe Christine Essenberg became a teacher because she was kept at the microscope and not allowed to do the field research she craved, and so she turned to one of the few occupations open to women back in the day. Or, as Essenberg pointed out to her boss when she was angling for a raise, teachers were simply being paid more than she was being paid, even with her PhD. \nKatie Hafner: Or maybe, finding herself in Constantinople with girls and women who didn’t get the education that she herself got, she then got more satisfaction setting up a school for them. \nClaire Trageser: And who knows. I mean maybe at some point, when she was teaching, she inspired a girl, or two girls, or a dozen, to shine in science.\nKatie Hafner: Yeah. I mean, we'll never really know. All we know is that she was a creature of her time and made her adjustments and appears to have built a satisfying and adventurous life, because really, all we had to go on as a jumping off point were these letters tucked away in Folder 29. \nWell, thank you, Claire.\nClaire Trageser: Katie, you are so welcome.\nKatie Hafner: Claire Trageser produced this episode of Lost Women of Science.

{"title": "Can Lucky Planets Get a Second Chance at Life?", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nWorlds around red giant stars—and others that don’t orbit any star at all—hint at an unexpected diversity of possibilities for planets and life in the universe\nFor decades, astronomers have endeavored to forecast with confidence the fate of planetary systems, including our own, throughout the cosmos. And these experts’ predictions have one central principle: to confidently guess what will eventually befall a planet, you have to know the size of its star.\nTiny stars don’t really burn out but rather fade away as they shine dimly for hundreds of billions or even trillions of years, likely keeping their planetary companions in tow. Massive stars go out with a bang, expiring as a supernova that leaves behind a neutron star or black hole. Such events tend to be cataclysmic for planetary systems. And stars of middling mass, like our own, expand into a red giant, engulfing or scorching their planets and then dissipating to become a slow-cooling stellar ember called a white dwarf.\nThis dismal fate is expected to befall our sun in some five billion years, setting what has been considered the last-gasp expiration date for life on Earth and perhaps throughout the solar system.\nBut insights from fresh studies of dying stars and doomed worlds elsewhere in the Milky Way challenge this consensus. Increasingly, it seems that the eventual fates of planetary systems, ours included, are not wholly written in the stars.\nSpecifically, two new findings—the discovery of a giant planet closely orbiting around a red giant star and the identification and estimation of the number of so-called rogue planets adrift in our galaxy—have highlighted that there are many more nuanced scenarios to consider. Planets can survive the ruin of their star, and the vast majority of planetary systems shed numerous worlds throughout their history.\nWhen our sun eventually enters its red giant phase, its radius will likely extend well beyond Earth’s present-day orbit. Even if our planet and the solar system’s other inner rocky worlds escape engulfment, the sun’s swelling will probably still spell their end because of the scorching temperatures they will experience. For the former scenario, astronomers have been seeing signs of this demise in the atmospheres of white dwarfs: researchers have found such stars littered with the remnants of dead planets they likely swallowed. \nIn fact, astronomers believed the fate of any planet orbiting a star within its red giant radius was likely sealed. That was until the discovery of the planet 8 Ursae Minoris b (8 UMi b), also known as Halla (after the South Korean mountain Hallasan and in honor of the South Korean astronomers who initially identified it in 2015). \n“We used to think that planets just couldn't survive around stars that become red giants—but this system provides a loophole,” explains Malena Rice, an assistant professor of astrophysics at Yale University, who co-authored new research on Halla postulating how it improbably survived.\nHalla was discovered by the wobbling its orbital tugging induced on its red giant home star, 8 Ursae Minoris (8 UMi). Track the period of that wobble over time, and you can discern the length of a planet’s year and its distance from its star. Such scrutiny showed that Halla orbits a mere 75 million kilometers from 8 UMi—that is, just half the distance between Earth and the sun. But standard modeling of 8 UMi’s red giant phase suggested that the star’s puffy, hot stellar atmosphere should have expanded about 30 million km farther out than that at its swollen peak. That is, Halla appeared to be a planet that shouldn’t exist. It should’ve been consumed and obliterated. Instead it had somehow escaped.\n“This planet was very lucky,” Rice says. “In its past, we think that it may have orbited two stars rather than one, and this helped it to survive what could have been a fiery fate.”\nBinary stars can exchange material back and forth, and they can even merge to become a single star, allowing a rich diversity of novel possibilities for any orbiting worlds. Such major redistributions of mass can alter planetary orbits while also profoundly influencing how a star shines, adding or siphoning away gas to change the nature and timing of its subsequent stellar evolution. According to the careful modeling work of Rice and her colleagues, the most likely explanation for Halla’s survival is that 8 UMi was once accompanied by a smaller close-in companion star, with which it eventually merged. Among other effects, the merger would’ve stifled 8 UMi’s red giant expansion, sparing Halla.\nAlthough this mechanism clarifies how some fortunate worlds might survive their star’s antics, it offers scant hope for our own solar system because our sun lacks a stellar companion to tamp down its eventual evolutionary swelling.\n“It will be tough for our rocky planets to make it through that process if the sun swells beyond their orbits,” Rice says. “But perhaps finding more systems like these might teach us about interesting natural ‘loopholes’ that occur in at least some types of planetary systems.” \nBountiful discoveries of newfound worlds—and with them, perhaps, the revelation of more “loopholes”—could come relatively soon via NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which is due to launch by May 2027. Much of Roman’s potential comes from its planned exoplanet survey, which will rely on a relatively underused technique known as microlensing. In this method, Roman will stare at many stars simultaneously, looking for instances where, by chance, a planet-bearing star will be perfectly aligned to cross in front of another “background” star much farther away. In such cases, some of the foreground star’s planets can act as gravitational lenses and magnify the background star’s light in a way that allows astronomers to reconstruct a lensing world’s mass and orbit. The technique is especially sensitive to planets orbiting far from their stars—a circumstellar region that remains scarcely probed by other planet-hunting methods.\nAnd in fact, it’s also capable of finding worlds that have left their stars behind entirely—something Roman could leverage to discover hundreds of rogue planets in interstellar space. Already preexisting microlensing surveys have found a handful of these free-floating worlds, and the statistics of this largely hidden population suggest most planetary systems have a surprisingly turbulent history.\nThe latest example comes from the MOA (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics) survey, a project conducted at the University of Canterbury Mt. John Observatory on New Zealand’s South Island by an international team, including scientists at NASA and Japan’s Osaka University. Running for almost a decade, MOA has gathered enough data to weigh in on the galactic abundance of rogue planets down to and even below Earth mass.\n“This number turns out to be somewhat larger than we would have guessed,” says David Bennett, a senior research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and co-author of two new papers reporting on these findings that were posted on the preprint server arXiv.org. These papers are set to be published in a future issue of the Astronomical Journal.\nSo far MOA has only detected six microlensing events that are consistent with magnification by a low-mass rogue planet, says MOA collaborator Takahiro Sumi, a professor at Osaka University, who co-authored both preprint studies. “Taking into account the low detection efficiency and our detections, we estimated that there are many such low-mass objects in the galaxy,” he adds. \n“We found that there are about 20 free-floating planets per star in the galaxy, and the number is dominated by low-mass planets with a mass similar to or smaller than that of Earth,” Bennett says. Those numbers, in turn, suggest an astounding two trillion rogue worlds in the Milky Way alone—six times more than the planets that are estimated to be bound to stars.\nIf this estimate is correct, it means most planetary systems are essentially dissolving across cosmic time, jettisoning many of their members via dynamical interactions between planets or their host stars that can slingshot unlucky worlds out into the interstellar abyss. It’s possible that when we look out into the solar system and other multiplanetary systems, the remaining planets we see are rare vestiges of once-bustling neighborhoods.\nBennett explains that most rogue worlds likely get ejected during the early stages of planetary formation, after which planetary systems settle into more stable configurations. The probability of ejections should generally decrease throughout a sunlike star’s life, he says. But when it swells into a red giant and begins shedding its outer layers of gas, the resulting shifts in planetary orbits can spark new rounds of world-ejecting instabilities.\nStars that are much heavier than the sun and end their life as a supernova, Bennett suggests, could also provide a rich source of rogue worlds and help to explain MOA’s outsize estimates.\nScott Gaudi, an astronomer and microlensing expert at the Ohio State University, thinks MOA’s surprising results are the best currently available but cautions that they remain very uncertain, so they “should be taken with a grain of salt.” Roman, he says, should beef up the statistical certitude, thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity of its prospective microlensing survey.\nIf MOA’s estimates are accurate, however, the sheer number of rogue worlds raises an interesting question: Could any of them provide conditions favorable to life? Ravi Kopparapu, a planetary habitability expert at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, says life on a rogue planet would be problematic—but not impossible.\n“Without a star, life on a cold rogue world would likely need to get its energy from internal sources,” Kopparapu says. “That could be in the form of tidal/frictional heat like in some of Jupiter’s moons where there are subsurface oceans, from residual energy when the planet formed or from the radioactive decay of heavy elements in the planet’s core.” Such worlds might resemble the large moons of our outer solar system and harbor potentially clement conditions beneath an icy crust.\nFor surface habitability, Kopparapu says a thick hydrogen atmosphere could possibly insulate a rogue planet and keep its surface temperature warm enough for living things to endure. Such atmospheres are easily blown away by stellar radiation, but because rogue planets do not orbit stars, they might be able to cling to an insulating atmosphere of hydrogen far longer than any sunbathed world could.\nAmid so much uncertainty, life’s prospects in such alien environments can seem either dizzying or dim. Might biospheres someday be found eking out existence around post-red giant stars or on worlds without a star at all? The thought is staggering, to say the least—and the fact that we could soon have real data to better answer such grand questions is all the more so.\nConor Feehly is a New Zealand based writer who covers topics ranging from astronomy to consciousness studies and the philosophy of science.

{"title": "Nobel Prizes Are Taking Longer to Award Groundbreaking Research", "date": "2023-10-04 20:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel laureates sometimes wait 20 years or more after making their award-worthy discovery to receive the prize\nThe road to a Nobel Prize, the most prestigious scientific award in the world, is growing ever longer, with almost half of laureates now waiting more than 20 years from making a Nobel-worthy discovery to receiving the prize.\nOne analysis shows that the average time between publishing the work and receiving one of the science prizes has nearly doubled in the past 60 years. Across the three science prizes, chemistry now has the longest ‘Nobel lag’ — an average of 30 years over the past decade — and physiology or medicine has the shortest, at 26 years (see ‘Decades-long delay’).\nAlfred Nobel’s will stated that the prizes should be awarded “to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.” In reality this has only happened a few times. But in the first half of the twentieth century, it was common for Nobel prize recipients to be in their 30s — and that is unheard of now, says Santo Fortunato, now a computational social scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington, who published a 2014 analysis on Nobel prizewinners since the award’s conception in 1901. His results showed that the time between laureates’ prize-winning research and their Nobel had slowly increased over the years, with a steeper slope after the 1960s than in the early years of the prize.\nThere are a number of possible reasons for this trend, says Yian Yin, a computational social scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It could be that the overall number of breakthroughs is increasing each year, so awards cannot keep up with the number of people who deserve to be recognized, he says. It is also the case that the importance of some works, which Yin describes as ‘sleeping beauties,’ are only realized years or decades later.\nAlternatively, the lengthening gap could be a sign that there has been a decrease in ‘disruptive’ science — important studies or discoveries that change the paradigm of their field. This could be causing the Nobel committees to focus more on the past.\nThe number of ‘big-splash’ discoveries are diminishing, but when they do happen, they tend to get recognized quickly, says Fortunato. For example, biochemists Jennifer Doudna at the University of California, Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier at the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry just eight years after their development of the CRISPR–Cas9 system as a genome-editing tool. Some researchers speculate that the inventors of mRNA vaccines, which were rolled out to millions of people worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic, could receive similar recognition.\nFortunato points out that, if the gap continues to grow, prominent scientists could miss out on the award owing to the Nobel Committee’s rule banning posthumous prizes (with the exception of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, a share of which was awarded to physician Ralph Steinman, who had passed away three days before the announcement, unbeknownst to the committee). “It has to stop at some point,” he says, adding that a rethink of the posthumous-awarding ban would allow more people’s work to get the recognition that it deserves.\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on September 29, 2023.\nLilly Tozer is an intern at Nature News.\n\nJosh Fischman\nDaniel Garisto\nLauren J.

{"title": "September Was the Most Anomalously Hot Month Ever", "date": "2023-10-04 19:21:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nSeptember shattered a record for the highest temperature anomaly of any month and could help push 2023 to be the first year to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures\nIn a year already overloaded with so many climate-related superlatives, it’s time to add another to the list: September was the most anomalously warm month ever recorded.\nAnd the steady heat building this year could make 2023 not only the hottest year on record but the first to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures, or the stable climate that preceded the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Under the landmark Paris climate accord, nations have pledged to try to keep global warming under that threshold. “It’s very worrying,” says Kate Marvel, a senior climate scientist at Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization that develops roadmaps for climate solutions.\nAccording to data kept by the Japan Meteorological Agency, this September was about 0.5 degree C (0.9 degree F) hotter than the previous hottest September in 2020. It was also about 0.2 degree C (0.4 degree F) warmer than the previous record high temperature anomaly—a measure of how much warmer or colder a given time period is, compared with the average—which had been set in February 2016 during a blockbuster El Niño.\nThe September anomaly “is so far above anything we’ve seen before,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist who works at the payment processing firm Stripe and wrote about September’s heat in a recent blog post. On X, formerly known as Twitter, he called the feat “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.”\nThe milestone reached last month comes on the heels of July setting the record for the hottest month overall. (July is always the hottest month of the year globally because it occurs at the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer. The Northern Hemisphere has much more landmass to soak up the sun’s rays than the Southern Hemisphere, so it has the bigger influence on the global annual temperature cycle.)\nIn a marker of just how much global temperatures have risen in recent decades, Hausfather observes, “this September will be hotter than most Julys before the last decade or two.”\nTwo main factors are at play in driving temperatures to such extremes: their inexorable increase from burning fossil fuels and an El Niño event that is shaping up to be a strong one. El Niño is a part of a natural climate cycle that features a tongue of unusually warm waters across the eastern Pacific Ocean. Those waters release heat into the atmosphere and can cause a cascade of changes to key atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the weather around the world.\nHeat waves have broken records all over the globe during the past few months, including prolonged events called heat domes that plagued the southern stretch of the U.S. and parts of the Mediterranean. Summerlike temperatures were even felt in South America during the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Two of the heat waves—one in the U.S. Southwest and one in Europe—were found to be virtually impossible without global warming. And summerlike heat has continued in places into October.\nThe most drastic temperature anomalies typically come in the winter months, when El Niño peaks in strength. In fact, the previous most anomalously warm month was February 2016, during one of the strongest El Niños on record. But this year “we’re seeing these [big anomalies] in the Northern Hemisphere summer,” Hausfather says. That leaves open the possibility of even larger anomalies when this event peaks this winter, particularly if it ends up being another strong event.\nIt is possible there is also some influence from the phasing out of sulfur-containing fuels used by ships because the aerosols spewed into the air from burning those fuels tend to have a slight cooling effect. The eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano in the southern Pacific Ocean last year may also be nudging up temperatures because of the huge amounts of water vapor—also a greenhouse gas—it injected into the atmosphere. But both factors have very small influences, compared with climate change and El Niño.\nGiven that this El Niño is expected to persist and likely to strengthen, there’s a good chance that 2023 or 2024—or both—will become the hottest year on record, besting 2016 (and 2020, which some agencies who monitor climate have tied with 2016). That isn’t surprising, given that there has been a tenth of a degree of warming since 2016, though it is “remarkable just how quickly we’ve seen warmth this year,” Hausfather says. Part of the apparent rapid warming is because 2023 began in the tail end of an unusual string of three back-to-back La Niña events. These tend to have a cooling impact on the global climate, though La Niñas today are hotter than even El Niños of several decades ago.\nBeyond potentially becoming the hottest year on record, 2023 could also be the first year to top 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures (some individual months have already passed that threshold). But even if that happens, all hope is not lost for meeting the Paris accord goals. That threshold is measured as an average of several decades, and climate scientists have long expected that a single year would pass that mark a decade or so before the world could be considered permanently above that limit. “There is still time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,” Marvel says. “It is going to be incredibly difficult. The pathways are narrowing.”\nBut this year should be considered a warning of the future we face if we don’t take rapid, ambitious action. “This is what the world looks like when it’s 1.5 degrees hotter in a year, and it’s terrible,” she says. When the world does permanently pass 1.5 degrees C, the climate anomalies for individual years will reach higher than that mark.\nTo stave off that future, every bit of carbon we can keep, or take, out of the atmosphere is crucial. “Every tenth of a degree matters,” Hausfather says.\nAndrea Thompson is an associate editor covering the environment, energy and earth sciences.

{"title": "Dengue's Spread in Europe Could Spur Vaccine Development", "date": "2023-10-04 17:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nBut dengue in wealthy countries could divert medication away from poorer nations that may need it more\nCLIMATEWIRE | In the early morning of the last day of August, Parisians experienced for the first time a practice normally confined to tropical regions — authorities fumigating the city against the tiger mosquito. The event was a tangible confirmation of what public health stats already showed: Dengue, the deadly mosquito-borne disease, had well and truly arrived in Europe.\nIn 2022, Europe saw more cases of locally acquired dengue than in the whole of the previous decade. The rise marks both a public health threat and a corresponding market opportunity for dengue vaccines and treatments; news that should spur the pharmaceutical industry to boost investment into the neglected disease.\nOn the face of it, this shift would appear to benefit not only countries like France but also nations like Bangladesh and the Philippines that have long battled dengue.\nBut that assumption could be fatally flawed, experts told POLITICO.\nPeople working in the field say the rise of dengue in the West could, in fact, make it harder to get lifesaving drugs to those who need them most, because pharmaceutical companies develop tools that are less effective in countries where the dengue burden is the highest or because wealthy nations end up hoarding these medicines and vaccines.\n“It might look like a good thing — and it is a good thing — that we're getting more products developed, but does it then create a two-tier system where high-income populations get access to it and then we still have the access gap for low- and middle-income countries?” asked Lindsay Keir, director of the science and policy advisory team at think tank Policy Cures Research.\nClimate change and migration mean the mosquitoes that transmit dengue, as well as other diseases such as chikungunya and Zika, are setting up shop in Europe. The most recent annual data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control shows that, in 2022, Europe saw 71 cases of locally acquired dengue: 65 in France and six in Spain.\nWhile dengue usually results in mild or no symptoms, it can also lead to high fever, severe headache and vomiting. Severe dengue can cause bleeding from the gums, abdominal pain and, in some cases, death.\nSo far, the mosquito has mostly been confined to southern Europe, but it's a worry across the Continent. In Belgium, the national public health research institute Sciensano has even launched an app where members of the public can submit photos of any Asian tiger mosquitos they spot.\nThe diseases spread by these mosquitoes have traditionally fallen under the umbrella of neglected tropical diseases, a group of infections that affect mainly low-income countries and struggle to attract research and development investment. But this is changing.\nPolicy Cures Research, which publishes an annual report on R&D investment into neglected diseases, removed dengue vaccines from their assessment in 2013. Dengue was no longer seen as an area where there was market failure, due to the emergence of a market that the private sector could tap into.\nThe organization is still tracking dengue drugs and biologics and their 2022 analysis showed a 33 percent increase in funding for research into non-vaccine products compared to the previous year, with industry investment reaching a record high of $28 million.\nSibilia Quilici, executive director of the vaccine maker lobby group Vaccines Europe, said the most recent pipeline review of members found that roughly 10 percent were targeting neglected diseases. There is more R&D happening in this area, said Quilici.\nAcross the major drugmakers, J&J is working on a dengue antiviral treatment and MSD has a dengue vaccine in their pipeline, while Sanofi has a second yellow fever jab in development. Two dengue vaccines are already approved in the European Union — one from Sanofi and another from Takeda. Moderna recently told POLITICO that it is looking closely at a dengue vaccine candidate and it already has a Zika candidate in the works.\nBut just because there might soon be larger markets for major pharmaceutical companies doesn’t mean the products will be suitable for the populations that have been waiting years for these tools.\nRachael Crockett, senior policy advocacy manager at the non-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), said increased pharmaceutical investment in a particular disease won't necessarily lead to products developed that are globally relevant. “Industry will — and governments are also more likely to — focus on prevention,” she said.\nThat means tools such as vaccines will be prioritized; but in countries where dengue is endemic, the rainy season completely overburdens their health systems and what they desperately need are treatments, said Crockett.\nShe also said a massive increase in investment without a structure to ensure access to resulting products means “we have absolutely no guarantee that there isn't going to be hoarding, [that] there isn't going to be high prices.” Case in point: The U.S. national stockpile of Ebola vaccines, which exists despite there never having been an Ebola outbreak in the country.\nUnderlying many of these fears are the mistakes of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw countries with less cash and political heft at the back of the queue when it came to vaccines.\nLisa Goerlitz, head of German charity Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevölkerung’s Brussels office, warned if drug development picks up because of a growing market in high-income countries, then accessibility, affordability and other criteria that make it suitable for low resource settings might not be prioritized.\nVaccines Europe’s Quilici sought to allay these concerns, pointing to the pharmaceutical industry's Berlin Declaration, a proposal to reserve an allocation of real-time production of vaccines in a health crisis. Quilici said this was a “really strong commitment … which comes right from the lessons learnt from Covid-19 and which could definitely overcome the challenges we had during the pandemic, if it is taken seriously.”\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "Entangled Light from Multitasking Atoms Could Spark Quantum Breakthroughs", "date": "2023-10-04 13:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA colorful quirk of quantum optics could lead to significant advances in quantum communication and computing\nDriving late at night, you come upon a red light and stop the car. You lift your hand wearily to block the red glow streaming through your windshield. Suddenly, both the green and yellow lights come on, hitting your eyeballs at the same time. Confused, you take your hand away, and again only the red color appears.\nThis surreal scenario is what would actually happen if the traffic light was a single atom illuminated by a laser beam, as recently shown experimentally by researchers in Berlin. They looked at the light scattered by an atom and saw that photons—the tiniest particles of light—arrived at the detector one at a time. The scientists blocked the brightest color they saw, and suddenly pairs of photons of two slightly different colors started arriving at their detector simultaneously. They reported their findings in Nature Photonics in July.\nThe reason for this counterintuitive effect is that single atoms are skilled little multitaskers. Through different underlying processes, they can scatter a variety of colors at the same time like a dangerous traffic light that shines all three colors at once. Yet because of quantum interference between these processes, an observer only sees one of the metaphorical traffic light’s colors at a time, preserving peace on the road.\nThis experiment also paves the way for novel quantum information applications. When the brightest color is blocked, the photons that pop up simultaneously are entangled with each other, behaving in sync even when they are separated over large distances. This provides a new tool for quantum communication and information processing in which entangled photon pairs can serve as distributed keys in quantum cryptography or store information in a quantum memory device.\nAtoms can be surprisingly picky about their couplings with light. Based on the varying arrangements of their constituent electrons, atoms of different elements each display clear preferences for which colors of light they strongly scatter. Proving as much is as simple as shining a laser at an atom, with the laser tuned to a particular color that closely matches that atom’s scattering preference. As expected, your detector will show the atom scattering photons of that predominant color. But strangely, the scattered photons will stream into the detector one at a time, as if in a single-file line. Up through the early 1980s physicists generally accepted a naive explanation for this strange effect: the photons arrive as if in a queue because the atom can only scatter one photon at a time.\nIn 1984, however, two researchers dug into the math governing this phenomenon and found that the reality is much more complicated—and much more inherently quantum. They theorized that the atom is actually doing many things simultaneously: scattering not only single photons but also, through an entirely different process, photonic pairs, triplets and quadruplets. Nevertheless, only one photon at a time arrives at the detector because of quantum interference among these processes.\nRegular interference occurs between two waves like ripples on a pond, overlapping in a pattern of crests and troughs. A distinctive feature of the quantum world is that interference occurs not only between actual waves but also between probabilities: a photon sent through two slits has some probability of going through the left slit and some probability of going through the right one. The two possible paths interfere with each other, forming a pattern of crests and troughs. Block either slit, and the pattern disappears. “I like to tell my students, ‘Imagine that you want to prevent a burglar from entering your house and going into the living room. Just leave two doors open, and then you will have destructive interference, and the thieves cannot go into the living room,’” jokes physicist Jean Dalibard, who co-authored the 1984 paper.\nIn Dalibard’s model, however, this interference is not a joke at all. It actually happens between the two underlying processes, the single-photon and multiphoton scattering. And it happens not in space but in time such that a probability trough appears for two photons arriving at the same time. So the atom multitasks, yet it does so in a way that looks suspiciously like doing just one thing.\nDalibard’s complex description of the multitasking atom languished in relative obscurity until recently. “I was very happy that the group from Berlin found this paper. I don’t know how they did,” he says. From their end, the researchers in Berlin were fascinated by the counterintuitive theory introduced by Dalibard and his co-author, physicist Serge Reynaud. “When we started to dig into the old literature from the 1980s, we really got intrigued,” says Max Schemmer, a former postdoctoral researcher at Humboldt University of Berlin and a co-author of the recent work.\nSchemmer and his colleagues saw the potential of recently developed technology to experimentally test this theory. First, they cooled a cloud of rubidium atoms to just shy of absolute zero. Then they used optical tweezers—a tightly focused laser beam strong enough to grab extremely tiny objects—to isolate and hold one atom. Next they illuminated that atom with another laser tuned to rubidium’s scattering preference and placed a lens off to the side to collect the scattered light and channel it into an optical fiber.\nTo block the brightest color, the researchers guided the light into a finely tuned filter created by a ring of optical fiber. The length of the ring was chosen and adjusted precisely to create destructive interference for only one color of light. When this filter was included in the light’s path, they saw the brightest color disappear. And as Dalibard and Reynaud had predicted, photons of two slightly different colors suddenly started arriving at the detector in simultaneous pairs.\nBy blocking the brightest color, thus taking the atom’s single-photon-generating process offline, Schemmer and his colleagues were able to see the other process in action without the destructive interference created by the dominant single atom—much like a traffic light that shines both green and yellow when red is blocked.\nThe atom’s “second task” of scattering photons in pairs could come in handy for quantum computing and communication. Once the brightest color is blocked, the pairs of photons that arrive simultaneously are entangled with each other—entanglement being the not-so-secret ingredient that gives quantum approaches advantages over classical ones.\nEntangled photon pairs could be used to share quantum information across vast distances or to transmit it between different mediums. Conveniently, the photon pairs produced with this technique come in a very precise color rather than being spread across larger chunks of the rainbow like photon pairs produced by conventional methods. This makes them particularly useful for efficiently storing quantum information in a quantum memory device, Schemmer says, which could in turn lead to more robust quantum communication networks.\nAdditionally, these photon pairs possess a unique kind of entanglement that is not offered by other sources: a syncing in time. “There is one existing technique of producing entangled pairs of photons,” says Magdalena Stobinska, a quantum optics expert, who did not participate in the work. “But this is a different degree of freedom and therefore can be used for different types of applications. So it broadens the palette of efficiently produced entangled pairs of photons. And I think that’s cool.”\nAnd theory predicts that photon pairs are not the end of the story. The atom is also simultaneously scattering entangled photons in threes, fours, and so on. Blocking the red on this “traffic light” makes not only yellow and green shine through but also blue, orange, and much more. Clusters of entangled photons created this way could potentially serve as resources for photon-based quantum computing. “This system is like a treasure trove of quantum correlations,” says Fabrice P. Laussy, a professor of light-matter interactions at the University of Wolverhampton in England, who reviewed the recent study but did not participate in the research. “Everything is in there.”\nDina Genkina is a Brooklyn, N.Y.–based freelance journalist and a science communicator at the Joint Quantum Institute.\nKatherine Wright\nChris Ferrie | Opinion\nAnil Ananthaswamy\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "A Popular Decongestant Doesn't Work. What Does?", "date": "2023-10-04 12:00:00", "text": "The popular decongestant phenylephrine is not effective, an FDA panel found. Here’s what to use instead.\nTanya Lewis: Hi, this is Your Health, Quickly, a Scientific American podcast series!\nJosh Fischman: We bring you the latest vital health news: Discoveries that affect your body and your mind.  \nLewis: And we break down the medical research to help you stay healthy. I’m Tanya Lewis.\nFischman: I’m Josh Fischman.\nLewis: We’re Scientific American’s senior health editors. \nFischman: Today, we’re talking about decongestants. Scientists who advise the FDA recently concluded that phenylephrine, a common decongestant in cold medicines, doesn’t work. We’ll talk about what actually does.\n[Clip: Show theme music]\nLewis: I don’t know about you, Josh, but I have bad allergies and my sinuses are blocked pretty often. I’ve tried all sorts of things to help, from nasal sprays and decongestants to to antihistamines to hot showers. Some of these things help, some of them don’t.\nFischman: What helps you the most of all those things, Tanya?\nLewis: I find that the steroid nasal sprays work pretty well, but I don’t like to use them all the time.\nFischman: How come?\nLewis: Um, I just find that sometimes I develop a tolerance to it so it stops having the same effect. Sometimes hot showers do help temporarily, but usually the congestion comes back.\nFischman: Yeah, and there’s only so long you can stand under a hot shower, right? \nLewis: Right.\nFischman: I’ve tried those saline sprays up my nose. They kind of flush things out and I feel more comfortable. But I have to use them for a bunch of days before I feel any difference.\nLewis: Yeah, those saline ones are pretty good. \nFischman: Overall, I tend to go for decongestant tablets, which are supposed to reduce swelling inside my nose, opening up my airways.\nLewis: You’re not alone in preferring tablets. One of the most popular decongestant ingredients is phenylephrine. It’s found in drugs like Sudafed PE, Benadryl Allergy D Plus Sinus, and Vicks Dayquil Cold and Flu Relief.\nBut earlier this month, in a rare move, an FDA advisory panel declared that oral phenylephrine is completely useless at clearing up congestion.\nFischman: That really surprised me. I’ve been buying cold and flu medicines for years. And I always look to see if a decongestant like  phenylephrine is in the capsule.\nLewis: I’d heard for a while that it wasn’t that effective, but it’s in a lot of cold medicines. In fact, it became popular because the standard over-the-counter decongestant, pseudoephedrine —the active ingredient in regular Sudafed—got locked up behind pharmacy counters.  That’s because it can be used as an ingredient in making methamphetamine.\nFischman:  I remember that. In the mid-2000s, all these cold medicines were suddenly put behind plexiglass windows with padlocks on them. I had to ask a pharmacist if I wanted some, and there was a limit to how much I could buy.\nLewis: Exactly. So, more products started using phenylephrine. \nFischman: Basically they were using it as a substitute?\nLewis: Yep. Phenylephrine was actually approved in the 1970s, so it had been around a while. But even back then, the FDA said it wasn’t very effective as a decongestant.\nJennifer Le: There was a cough and cold panel in 1972, in which the panel specifically noted that the data were not strongly indicative of efficacy. So this goes back quite a number of years.\nLewis: That’s Jennifer Le, a professor at the pharmacy school at the University of California San Diego. She was on the recent FDA advisory panel earlier this month that made the decision that phenylephrine wasn’t effective.\nBack in the 1970s, the FDA was more concerned with safety than effectiveness.\nLe: So first and foremost, at the dose that's currently approved, 10 milligram for nasal congestion, it does not appear to provide any safety concerns, except in a very small population who has high blood pressure.\nLewis: Then, in 2007, an FDA advisory panel reviewed the data.\nLe: And in reviewing the data they thought that efficacy was maybe suggestive at higher doses, and so the recommendation at that time was to obtain more clinical data. And the committee who reviewed it withdrew approval for those less than 12 years of age.\nLewis: Fast-forward to today, when another FDA panel—the one Le was one—reviewed the drug’s effectiveness again. They looked at more recent data on both how the drug is metabolized and how well it works in people.\nLe: And the pharmacologic data side indicated that when you take oral phenylephrine, most of it is metabolized to inactive forms, so very little of the active drug—in fact, one percent, based on FDA data—actually gets into the blood.\nFischman: So, most of the drug isn’t even making it to the nose, in other words.\nLewis: Exactly. In addition to that, three trials of oral phenylephrine showed it was no better than a placebo at relieving congestion.\nSo, the committee voted unanimously that oral phenylephrine is basically useless.\nFischman: The FDA panel only reviewed forms of the drug that come in capsules, tablets and syrups, though. So what about things like nasal sprays?\nLewis: They didn’t review phenylephrine nasal sprays. Those might still be effective since they are going right into your nose. But the oral pills won’t do much.\nFischman: But I’ve been taking these cold medications with phenylephrine for years and they do make me feel better. I think. Is that just a placebo effect?\nLewis: Not necessarily. Those meds usually are a combo of several ingredients such as acetaminophen, which helps reduce pain and fever, and antihistamines, which help in the first few days. So the combo may still make you feel better.\nFischman: Overall, though, if oral phenylephrine doesn’t work, what should people use instead of it?\nLewis: I asked Le the same question. She basically said that for short-term congestion with a cold, you should just wait it out.\nLe: The nasal congestion that occurs with the common cold is self-limiting. And so if it's possible, and if it's tolerable—I have a very high tolerance rate when it comes to symptoms— let it resolve, let the symptom resolve. You know, there's nasal saline products that can maybe help with congestion a little bit. A warm, hot, bath, a humidifier can help with some of that too. \nFischman: But Tanya, you said you tried a lot of those things, and often they don’t work. \nLewis: Yeah, I find that most of them only offer temporary relief.\nFischman: So are you just supposed to walk around with your nose blocked or running for a week, and a headache pounding, maybe a box of tissues tucked under your chin? \nLewis: I know, right? It really doesn’t seem great. There are other decongestants, like pseudoephedrine, which you can get by asking a pharmacist, like we mentioned earlier. And that works pretty well. You can also use nasal sprays like Afrin, but be careful—if you use those longer than three days, they can cause your symptoms to rebound.\nFischman: What about other sprays like Flonase or Nasacort?\nLewis: Those steroid nasal sprays work pretty well. But ask a doctor if you’re congested for longer than a few days, because you might have chronic inflammation due to allergies.\nFischman: And allergies are a different story, right? \nLewis: Right. For that kind of congestion, you should consult an allergy specialist. The standard therapy involves some combination of oral and nasal antihistamines and nasal steroids like Flonase. In some cases, you can get allergy shots or even surgery.\nFischman: Okay, but for colds, clearly it’s time to restock my medicine chest. Those saline sprays do help me, so maybe some more of those. And if I have a rougher case, it looks like I’m going to ask the drugstore to take out their keys, and open up their pseudoephedrine stash. \n[CLIP: Show music]\nFischman: Your Health, Quickly is produced by Tulika Bose, Jeff DelViscio, Kelso Harper, Carin Leong, and by us.

{"title": "2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Goes to Tiny Quantum Dots with Huge Effects", "date": "2023-10-04 11:21:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThree scientists won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of quantum dots, an entirely new class of material that is used in large-screen TVs and cancer surgery\nThe 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded today to three scientists for the discovery of quantum dots. These are nanoparticles so small that their size controls their many properties, such as their color. And that in turns makes them invaluable in applications ranging from large color displays to energy production.\nThe winners are Moungi Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louis Brus of Columbia University and Alexei Ekimov of the firm Nanocrystals Technology in New York State. The three scientists will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or nearly $1 million.\nProducing a cornucopia of colors, quantum dots are common materials in big television screens today. Essentially they are tiny crystals, but it’s easier to think of each of them as a compressed ball, just a few nanometers in diameter, that contains electrons. The electrons are key to how the dots work. “If you take an electron and put it into a small space, its wave function gets compressed,” meaning the electron has less freedom to move, said Heiner Linke, a member of the Nobel Committee for  Chemistry, at the announcement. The compression allows the electrons to store more energy.\nThe electrons release that energy as photons—packets of light—and those photons will appear as different colors, depending on how much the electrons are squeezed.\nThat change is a quantum effect, one of the mysterious things that happens in the realm of the incredibly small. So, for example, the smallest dots will emit more shorter-wavelength blue light than longer-wavelength red light. Enlarging the dots slightly will change the color composition.\nThe dots are also used in biomedical imaging—to visualize blood vessels feeding tumors—and in solar cells, where they can amplify the energy generated by the panels. Changing their size can also change other properties, such as their melting point.\nBawendi, when reached by phone by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences after the announcement, said he was “very surprised..., sleepy, shocked ... and very honored.” The rest of the world may have been slightly less surprised. Bawendi’s name, along with his two colleagues, was leaked in a document sent out by the academy hours before the official announcement. It was a rare crack in what is ordinarily a highly organized and confidential process. Hans Ellegren, secretary-general of the academy, said the organization did not know what had happened.\nThe news, however it came out, was greeted with applause by other chemists. “These remarkable nanoparticles have huge potential to create smaller, faster, smarter devices, increasing the efficiency of solar panels and the brilliance of your TV screen,” said Gill Reid, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry and an inorganic chemist at the University of Southampton in England, in a recent statement. The Nobel “is really exciting and shows how chemistry can be used to solve a range of challenges,” she said.\nAnd while quantum effects are often considered the province of physics, Judith Giordan, a chemist and president of the American Chemical Society, makes a strong case that dots are chemical products. “We own electrons. They’re on every single atom,” she says. And while the effects of confining electrons in tiny spaces were theorized by physicists, “it was chemists who moved them into novel architectures of atoms, who figured out how to actually produce them in the lab and then in manufacturing settings.”\nThe notion of quantum dots first showed up in theories in the 1930s and then stalled for decades. But in the early 1980s Ekimov put nanoparticles of copper chloride in glass and showed that the particle size changed the color of the glass through quantum effects. Several years later Brus achieved similar color alterations with nanoparticles floating freely in a fluid. \nBawendi, in 1993, developed a way to standardize dot production, which opened the field to many other labs and companies. “He made it easy,” says chemist Rigoberto Advincula, who works on nanoscale technology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Bawendi’s lab created a kind of “soup” of other substances that attached to quantum dot seeds and precisely regulated their growth. This made the seeds very “tunable,” in chemistry lingo, Advincula says. It was a simple way to control their size and thus tune them to produce different levels of energy, he adds.\nIn addition to big screens and solar panels, dots are used to adjust the color of LED lights to make them less harsh. Medical scientists are also exploring their use as sensors and probes for hard-to-find molecules in the body. After the announcement, Bawendi said that “it’s just the beginning.”\nJosh Fischman is a senior editor at Scientific American who covers medicine, biology and science policy. He has written and edited about science and health for Discover, Science, Earth, and U.S. News & World Report.
