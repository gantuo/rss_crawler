{"title": "Best and worst of Week 5: More trouble for Pats and Giants, a letdown for Ravens", "date": "2023-10-09 15:30:21", "text": "Brock Purdy finds George Kittle in the end zone wide open as the 49ers drive right down the field to start the game. (0:27)\nWeek 5 of the NFL season got started Thursday night with a Chicago Bears breakout, as Justin Fields threw four touchdown passes and the Bears got their first win, beating the Washington Commanders.\nOn Sunday, the Jacksonville Jaguars' defense slowed the high-flying Buffalo Bills offense enough to win in London. Back in the United States, the Detroit Lions rolled to 4-1, the New Orleans Saints shut out the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense shined brightly in the fourth quarter against the Baltimore Ravens.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals' offense found its rhythm against the Arizona Cardinals, and the Philadelphia Eagles remained undefeated after beating the Los Angeles Rams.\nOn Sunday night, the San Francisco 49ers routed the Dallas Cowboys, as Brock Purdy and George Kittle connected for a trio of touchdowns.\nOur NFL Nation reporters reacted to all the action, answering lingering questions coming out of each game and picking out who -- or what -- is rising and falling for every team. Let's get to it.\nJump to a matchup:\nCHI-WSH | JAX-BUF | HOU-ATL | CAR-DET\nTEN-IND | NYG-MIA | NO-NE | BAL-PIT\nPHI-LAR | CIN-ARI | NYJ-DEN | KC-MIN | DAL-SF\n\nWhen will the 49ers lose a game? It's too early to start talking undefeated season, but the Niners' demolition of Dallas was a resounding warning that it's going to take a special effort to beat them. With quarterback Brock Purdy at the controls of an offense loaded with talent and a stingy defense that had its best performance of the season, the Niners have won 15 straight regular-season games (tied for the franchise record). There is no obvious potential loss on this schedule until late November, if at all.\nStock up after the win: LB Fred Warner. It's hard to improve on being the best player at your position in the league, but it's worth tipping the cap to Warner for his virtuoso performance Sunday night when he became the first Niner since NaVorro Bowman in 2013 to post a sack, an interception and a forced fumble in the same game.\nStock down after the win: LG Aaron Banks' biceps. It's really nitpicking to find much wrong with this performance, but Banks suffered a biceps injury that kept him out the entire second half. -- Nick Wagoner\nNext game: at Browns (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nHow big is the gap between the Cowboys and 49ers now? The Niners did whatever they wanted against a Dallas defense that was allowing 10.3 points per game. The Cowboys' offense looked worse than it looked in the 19-12 January playoff loss to San Francisco. The good news? The Cowboys won't see the 49ers again until the playoffs -- if they make it. They get two cracks at the similarly undefeated Philadelphia Eagles, but there appears to be a gap between the top two teams in the NFC and everybody else, especially after the embarrassment that was Sunday.\nStock up after the loss: The weather was certainly nice for a football game. Cooler temperatures. A little breeze. Grass field. Oh, you wanted a player? Maybe Johnathan Hankins. The defensive tackle had two pass deflections in the first half. Maybe.\nStock down after the loss: QB Dak Prescott. He had two interceptions in the playoff loss and three more Sunday -- the third three-interception game of his career. In 11 possessions with Prescott, the Cowboys managed one touchdown, one field goal, three interceptions and nine drives that were three plays or fewer. -- Todd Archer\nNext game: at Chargers (Monday, Oct. 16, 8:15 p.m. ET)\n\nHas Travis Kelce's value to the Chiefs ever been more evident? No. Kelce has had some big games and huge moments. But he practically willed the Chiefs to a touchdown in the third quarter after returning to the game following an ankle injury. His leaping 14-yard grab on third down allowed the Chiefs to continue the drive early. He caught two more passes on the drive, including the touchdown that put them ahead 27-13.\nStock up after the win: WR Rashee Rice. Rice caught two passes on the opening drive of the third quarter, one for a touchdown, while Kelce was out of the game with the injury. Rice, a rookie, has dropped too many passes this season, but if he can lose that habit, he'll become a bigger factor in the Chiefs' passing game.\nStock down after the win: Defensive and special teams. The Chiefs committed four penalties for 36 yards on one Vikings drive in the first half, giving their opponents a field goal. The Vikings also got a 15-yard boost on another first-half drive when rookie Nic Jones interfered with a punt catch. That led to Minnesota's only TD of the half. -- Adam Teicher\nNext game: vs. Broncos (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET)\nIs it time for the Vikings to start planning for 2024? At 1-4, let's just say the odds are against them making the playoffs. Since 1990, 161 teams have started 1-4. Of those, 150 missed the postseason. That's a 7% hit rate, which suggests that the Vikings' \"competitive rebuild\" might get accelerated in the coming weeks, despite all four losses being by one score. In the short term, the Vikings might have to push forward without receiver Justin Jefferson, who didn't return after suffering a right hamstring injury.\nStock up after the loss: WR Jordan Addison. The rookie caught a career-high six passes for 64 yards on nine targets, including a 5-yard touchdown in the second quarter and a key fourth-down conversion in the fourth quarter.\nStock down after the loss: First-possession offense. The Vikings committed a turnover on their first possession against the Chiefs. It was the third consecutive game in which they've done so. On Sunday, it was a fumble by TE Josh Oliver that ultimately became a key play considering the Chiefs won the game by one score. -- Kevin Seifert\nNext game: at Bears (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nTravis Etienne Jr. finishes with more than 100 rushing yards and two touchdowns in the Jaguars' win over the Bills.\n\nShould offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett buy Breece Hall a steak dinner? Absolutely. Come to think of it, everyone on the Jets should treat Breece Hall to whatever he wants. With the Jets sputtering in an ugly game, Hall lifted the entire team with a career performance -- 22 rushes for 177 yards, including a 72-yard touchdown that changed the game. Playing on the same field where he suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2022, Hall replaced that horrible memory with a highlight film and helped Hackett have the last laugh after coach Sean Payton maligned him before the season.\nStock up after the win: LB Quincy Williams. He made the defensive play of the day, with a strip-sack that resulted in a scoop and score for CB Bryce Hall with 29 seconds left. Williams, who had two sacks, is having a career year.\nStock down after the win: QB Zach Wilson. He threw a late interception and mismanaged the clock at the end of the first half, costing his team a short field goal try. This was a step back after last week's career day, although he had a late turnover that day, as well. -- Rich Cimini\nNext game: vs. Eagles (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nWhy is there reason to worry about Denver's run defense? The Jets' scoop-and-score fumble return in the closing seconds sealed the win, but the Broncos' run defense set that messy table long before. After holding the Raiders to 61 yards rushing in the season opener, Denver's rush defense has given up 122, 350, 171 and 234 yards. Upcoming opponents such as the Chiefs, Packers and Bills will force the Broncos to defend the run out of their nickel package, and that has been a significant trouble spot.\nStock up after the loss: RB Jaleel McLaughlin. He had 63 yards of offense and a touchdown the first four times he touched the ball. The Broncos moved away from him, or seemingly put him in a more traditional between-the-tackles look as the game progressed, which doesn't play to his strengths, but he continues to flash the kind of quick-strike capability the team has not been able to produce often enough.\nStock down after the loss: WR Marvin Mims Jr. An early bobble on a first-quarter punt seemed to derail him for the afternoon. He finished with one catch and was part of a bad exchange with RB Samaje Perine that resulted in another turnover. -- Jeff Legwold\nNext game: at Chiefs (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET)\n\nIs Joe Burrow back? Yes. Absolutely. Not only did Burrow have his best passing game since he suffered his calf injury, completing 36 of 46 passes for 317 yards and three touchdowns, but the mobility he lacked through the first four games was very present against the Cardinals. Burrow had back-to-back scrambles for gains, something that was sorely lacking in the first four games. But his movement was on full display on an 11-yard touchdown pass to WR Ja'Marr Chase in the fourth quarter. He held the ball for 4.8 seconds, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, buying time until Chase streaked open.\nStock up after the win: Chase. He had three touchdowns Sunday after coming into the week with zero and set the Bengals' record for most catches in franchise history, finishing the game with 15 receptions for 192 yards.\nStock down after the win: Run defense. Cincinnati was gashed for big plays on the ground, which has become a common theme this season and is a major issue. WR Rondale Moore had a 41-yard run for the Cardinals and RB James Conner had a 35-yard rush. -- Ben Baby\nNext game: vs. Seahawks (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWhat will it take for the Cardinals to move from being competitive to getting wins? The Cardinals have competed hard, if nothing else, this season, staying in games until late. On Sunday, as was the case last week in San Francisco, they got down early, mounted a comeback but couldn't position themselves for a win. Arizona has evolved since its Week 2 meltdown against the Giants. But getting off to a faster start Sunday would have prevented the Cardinals from going down 10-0 in the first quarter and then having to play catch-up. It came down to small mistakes -- a missed PAT, a pick-six in the shadows of their own goal posts, passes that sailed. Fix those and the Cardinals might be able to turn close games into wins.\nStock up after the loss: Run game. The Cardinals had 142 of their 294 total yards on the ground, highlighted by Moore's 41-yard run and rookie RB Emari Demercado finishing with 45 yards and a touchdown in place of an injured Conner.\nStock down after the loss: Depth chart. Arizona took a hit with two major injuries, one to Conner, who suffered a knee injury and didn't return, and another to safety Jalen Thompson, who suffered a hamstring injury and also was lost for the day. -- Josh Weinfuss\nNext game: at Rams (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nTravis Kelce hauls in the pass from Patrick Mahomes and crosses the goal line for a touchdown.\n\nHas Jalen Hurts regained his MVP form? It looks that way. Hurts amassed nearly 400 yards of offense and set a season high in rushing yards. He became just the fourth player in NFL history with 50 pass touchdowns and 25 rush TDs in his first 50 NFL games, joining Daunte Culpepper, Cam Newton and Josh Allen. Hurts played well through the first four weeks, but with his running game taking off against Los Angeles, he went to another level, reminiscent of his 2022 campaign.\nStock up after the win: TE Dallas Goedert. He entered Week 5 with just 88 receiving yards but erupted for eight catches for 117 yards and caught his first touchdown of the season. One imperfection for the Eagles over the first quarter of the season has been red zone efficiency -- they came in ranked 24th at 46%. Feeding Goedert inside the 20-yard line could help that cause, as it did Sunday.\nStock down after the win: Pass defense. Philly entered the game ranked 30th in passing touchdowns allowed (9) and yielded two more against the Rams. Slot corner remains an issue. The Eagles tried three different players at nickel Sunday -- Mario Goodrich, Eli Ricks and the newly acquired Bradley Roby -- and struggled to contain Cooper Kupp & Co. -- Tim McManus\nNext game: at Jets (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nDid the return of Kupp deliver as the Rams expected? The Rams offense struggled against a now-5-0 Eagles team, but Kupp's return showed the potential for an offense led by him and rookie WR Puka Nacua. QB Matthew Stafford went to Kupp early and often; his 95 yards in the first half were his most in a first half in his last 19 games played, according to ESPN Stats & Information. Kupp finished with 118 yards on eight catches. But Sean McVay and Stafford still involved Nacua, who had seven catches for 71 yards.\nStock up after the loss: CB Ahkello Witherspoon. The veteran had a takeaway for the third straight game. His pick Sunday was just the third time Eagles QB Jalen Hurts has been intercepted when targeting WR A.J. Brown since the start of last season (including the playoffs).\nStock down after the loss: Third-down defense. The Rams struggled to get off the field against the Eagles on third down, specifically hampered by an inability to wrap up Hurts, who ran for 72 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. The Eagles were 13-for-18 on third down. -- Sarah Barshop\nNext game: vs. Cardinals (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\n\nHave the Lions upgraded at running back with David Montgomery as RB1? With Jahmyr Gibbs out with a hamstring injury, Montgomery continued to carry the load with 109 yards on 19 carries. His rushing touchdown on Sunday gives him six in his first four games. Former Lions RB Jamaal Williams set the franchise mark with 17 rushing touchdowns last season, with most coming on the goal line, but Montgomery has displayed an ability to do more. He scored a 42-yard touchdown in the first quarter, which was the second longest of his career.\nStock up after the win: TE Sam LaPorta. The rookie is proving to be a steal by GM Brad Holmes, scoring two touchdowns Sunday. His early connection with quarterback Jared Goff has made him an instant contributor for the offense. LaPorta's 25 receptions in his first five games are the third most for a tight end since 1950, joining Keith Jackson (29 in 1988) and Jordan Reed (26 in 2013).\nStock down after the win: Third-down offense. There wasn't much to nitpick after a complete win on both sides of the ball. But the offense was just 4-for-9 on third downs against the Panthers. After five games, the Lions' 39.4% conversion rate ranks 16th in the NFL; it's one of the rare categories in which the Lions' offense isn't among the league's best. -- Eric Woodyard\nNext game: at Buccaneers (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nShould the Panthers sit Bryce Young in favor of Andy Dalton? Young's turnovers are hurting the Panthers, who've given up 45 points off turnovers this season. Of those, 31 came directly after a Young fumble or interception, including 14 in the first half against the Lions. The most efficient the offense has been was in Week 3 vs. Seattle, when veteran backup Dalton started in place of an injured Young. The Seahawks had zero points off turnovers. Young is the long-term answer, but Dalton may be the short-term solution for this 0-5 team as it looks for an identity.\nStock up after the loss: Laviska Shenault Jr. The Panthers have been trying to decide whether he's best at wide receiver or running back. They seemed to tip their hand Sunday, giving the 2020 second-round pick (by the Jaguars) five rushes for 27 yards.\nStock down after the loss: RB Miles Sanders. He got a four-year, $25.4 million deal to be Carolina's lead back and take the pressure off Bryce Young as a runner and receiver. He came into Sunday's game averaging 2.9 yards per carry, and against the Lions he had only 32 yards rushing and a fumble that led to a Lions touchdown. -- David Newton\nNext game: at Dolphins (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\n\nIs Kyle Pitts' season breakout what jolted Ridder's best day as a pro? After a week full of questions about job security, quarterback Desmond Ridder responded with his best game as a pro, completing 28 of 37 passes for 329 yards and a touchdown while rushing once for a 7-yard touchdown and completing his second fourth-quarter comeback this season. It's his first game over 250 yards passing as a pro. A lot of it had to do with the reemergence of the tight end, who had his most receptions (seven for 87 yards) since his rookie year in 2021. This Ridder-Pitts connection is what Atlanta had been looking for.\nStock up after the win: DC Ryan Nielsen. Atlanta's defense has consistently done enough to win, allowing one touchdown per game over the past two weeks and kept the Falcons in games while the offense has had to sort out its issues.\nStock down after the win: RB Cordarrelle Patterson. It's likely the Falcons will say Patterson is still working his way back into the lineup, but he's been an offensive nonfactor his first two weeks, with a handful of combined snaps and one catch for 7 yards. -- Michael Rothstein\nNext game: vs. Commanders (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWill the Texans' scoring woes become a trend? Even though quarterback C.J. Stroud threw the go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Dalton Schultz, the passing attack was inconsistent. The Texans' passing offense was humming over the past three weeks -- ranking fourth in passing yards per game (281) coming into the matchup. But Stroud went 20 of 35 for 249 yards with a touchdown, and the offense scored only 19 points -- with four drives ending in field goals.\nStock up after the loss: Schultz. The tight end had his best game as a Texan with seven catches for 65 yards, a season high, with a touchdown.\nStock down after the loss: Pass defense. Coming into the matchup, the Falcons' passing offense averaged an NFL-worst 156 yards per game, and it was able to throw for 351 yards Sunday. -- DJ Bien-Aime\nNext game: vs. Saints (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\n\nHas the emergence of De'Von Achane turned the Dolphins into a run-first offense? The rookie did it again, turning in his third straight 100-yard rushing performance, highlighted by a 76-yard sprint to the end zone -- his fifth touchdown of the season. Achane finished with 151 yards on 11 carries, paving the way for a 222-yard day for the Dolphins on the ground. Raheem Mostert was no slouch, either, with 65 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries. Miami still tore up the Giants' defense through the air to the tune of 302 yards, but if Achane and Mostert are going to continue to run the ball this effectively, Miami has to ride that until the wheels fall off.\nStock up after the win: Big-play offense. We knew they were fast entering the season, but the Dolphins are now responsible for the seven fastest ball-carrier speeds in the NFL this season, including a new top overall speed courtesy of Tyreek Hill (22.01 mph).\nStock down after the win: QB Tua Tagovailoa. It wasn't his sharpest day, throwing a pair of interceptions. While 233 of his 302 passing yards came after the catch, it says a lot that a 300-yard, two-touchdown game is now considered a \"down\" performance for the fourth-year quarterback. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nNext game: vs. Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWhen is this offense going to show some competency? Sunday night in Buffalo isn't an ideal spot for a 1-4 team, even if there is a chance that running back Saquon Barkley (ankle) and left tackle Andrew Thomas (hamstring) return. Now the Giants also have to deal with the uncertainty of quarterback Daniel Jones (neck). It might be at least another couple of weeks before the Giants can get their offensive line to be functional. Giants quarterbacks were sacked seven times on Sunday, and the offense did not score a touchdown for the second straight game.\nStock up after the loss: The defense. The Giants' defense was their best offense Sunday. They gave up some big plays and 31 points to an explosive Miami offense, but they also had three turnovers, including Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six.\nStock down after the loss: S Isaiah Simmons. The 2020 top-10 pick, acquired by the Giants via trade last month, started in the place of Micah McFadden (ankle) at linebacker but failed to make a significant impact. He just wasn't able to shed blockers with any regularity. -- Jordan Raanan\nNext game: at Bills (Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET)\nThe Lions run a reverse flea-flicker that results in Sam LaPorta's second touchdown of the game.\n\nIs Kenny Pickett back on track? After struggling for three quarters, Kenny Pickett found George Pickens with a 41-yard touchdown pass to slip past the Ravens for a massive AFC North win. Pickett had hit Pickens two plays earlier on a perfectly placed back-shoulder throw for a 21-yard gain to set up the touchdown. That was his third career go-ahead touchdown pass in the final two minutes of regulation, the most of any player since the start of last season. Pickett has been shaky through the first month of the season, but entering the bye week, this gives the Steelers and their quarterback a significant boost.\nStock up after the win: Inside linebackers. This group was responsible for the biggest hits of the afternoon, including two third-down stops in the fourth quarter by Cole Holcomb and Elandon Roberts. Plus, Kwon Alexander had a sack and two tackles for loss -- including a key tackle for loss in the fourth quarter that led to a safety two plays later.\nStock down after the win: TE Gunner Olszewski. With Calvin Austin III hampered by an injury, Olszewski took up return duties and had a massive fumble in the second half. Joey Porter Jr.'s first career interception kept points off the board, but Olszewski's fumble comes after another error in the first week of the season. -- Brooke Pryor\nNext game: at Rams (Sunday, Oct. 22, 4:05 p.m. ET)\nHow big of a collapse was this for the Ravens? Baltimore went from seizing control of the division -- over an 80% projected favorite, according to ESPN Analytics -- to falling into a first-place tie with Pittsburgh and breathing life into its biggest rival. If the Ravens had won, they would have swept all three of their AFC North road games for the third time in franchise history. Instead, Baltimore let Sunday's game slip away with a Lamar Jackson interception in the end zone, five dropped passes, its ninth fumble of the season and a blocked punt. Now the Ravens head to London, the site of their biggest margin of defeat under coach John Harbaugh.\nStock up after the loss: LB Roquan Smith. In 15 games with Smith, Baltimore has allowed an NFL-best 13.8 points per game. The Ravens' defense hadn't allowed a touchdown in nine straight quarters before that 41-yard touchdown catch by George Pickens.\nStock down after the loss: QB Lamar Jackson. Mistakes continue to haunt Jackson, who threw an interception and fumbled in the fourth quarter. This was Jackson's fourth interception in the end zone of his career and seventh fumble of the season. -- Jamison Hensley\nNext game: vs. Titans in London (Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET)\nTyreek Hill gets behind the Giants' defense and scores a 69-yard touchdown for the Dolphins.\n\nCan the Saints sustain their offensive success? The Saints haven't had any momentum on offense dating back to last season, and they got their share of criticism after scoring only nine points in a loss to the Buccaneers last week. The Saints did what they've wanted to do all season: establish the run game and spread the ball around. Now they need to figure out a way to keep it going next week against the Houston Texans ... and beyond.\nStock up after the win: Offensive playmakers. Foster Moreau, Alvin Kamara and Chris Olave scored their first TDs of the season, Michael Thomas had a season-best in receiving yards and the Saints (offense and defense) hit the 30-point mark for the first time since Oct. 20, 2022.\nStock down after the win: TE Jimmy Graham. There admittedly weren't many options here following the Saints' best game of the season, but Graham couldn't haul in his only pass from Derek Carr in what likely would have resulted in a first down. -- Katherine Terrell\nNext game: at Texans (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nHow much longer will Bill Belichick stick with QB Mac Jones? Jones was coming off a nightmare performance in Week 4 against the Cowboys, and it only got worse against the Saints. He should have taken a sack in the first quarter but instead forced a fluttering pass under pressure that was returned for a pick-six by Tyrann Mathieu. It was all downhill from there. Yes, the OL is struggling. And yes, the pass-catchers struggle to gain separation consistently. But Jones' decision-making in that situation highlights one of the major issues holding back the offense -- turnovers that turn into points for the opposition. Backups Bailey Zappe (who replaced Jones in the fourth quarter) or Will Grier might not be an upgrade, but Jones' slide the past two weeks is a major concern.\nStock up after the loss: Demario Douglas. The rookie receiver nicknamed Pop provided the only pop for the team's offense with a 24-yard catch in the first quarter -- he's a promising prospect who should be part of the solution when he returns from concussion protocol.\nStock down after the loss: Bill Belichick. When a team shows no spark at home coming off a blowout loss on the road, it reflects poorly on the head coach. -- Mike Reiss\nNext game: at Raiders (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET)\n\nShould the Colts rethink their usage of Anthony Richardson? The Colts drafted the quarterback with the intent of using him as a runner and passer to fully take advantage of his unique skill set. But considering his latest injury -- he left the game with an injured right shoulder and did not return -- the Colts might have to rethink how they deploy their franchise quarterback. The Colts ranked fourth in the NFL in designed quarterback runs coming into Week 5, and Richardson's injury on Sunday came -- you guessed it -- on a designed quarterback run.\nStock up after the win: The offensive line. The unit was subjected to heavy criticism last season, but this group has bounced back to bolster a surprisingly productive running game. On Sunday, running back Zack Moss was the benefactor, running for a career-high 165 yards and two touchdowns.\nStock down after the win: The edge rushers. They had been productive in previous weeks, but the group -- led by defensive end Samson Ebukam -- was rendered ineffective against the pass Sunday. The Colts finished with one sack, allowing Titans QB Ryan Tannehill sufficient time to consistently throw down the field. -- Stephen Holder\nNext game: at Jaguars (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWhat happened to the Titans' red zone offense? Entering Sunday, the Titans' red zone scoring percentage was 38.4, ranking 29th in the NFL. Tennessee's red zone woes continued against the Colts, as the Titans cashed in on only one of their four visits inside the 20. They must find ways to get receiver DeAndre Hopkins involved in the red zone, especially on a day when he finally got loose and made a mark elsewhere on the field. The Titans keep finding themselves in close-scoring games, which makes scoring touchdowns in the red zone critical.\nStock up after the loss: Hopkins. The receiver was virtually unstoppable against the Colts as he posted eight receptions for 148 yards, marking the first 100-yard receiving performance by a Titans wideout since Week 11 last season.\nStock down after the loss: Kristian Fulton. The cornerback struggled mightily on multiple plays, starting with a blown coverage in zone defense, then a pair of pass interference penalties, and finally, he got turned around on another play by a Colts receiver. -- Turron Davenport\nNext game: vs. Ravens in London (Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET)\n\nAfter a rough start, is this victory a sign the Jaguars are going to be a factor in the AFC after all? QB Trevor Lawrence has said multiple times that you're measured by what you do against the league's best teams. The Jaguars failed against Kansas City in Week 2, but against the Bills -- one of the hottest teams in the NFL -- the Jaguars dominated time of possession, yardage and third downs. So by Lawrence's measure, the answer is yes. There are still concerns -- especially along the offensive line -- but the Jaguars now have a critical tiebreaker over the Bills when it comes to playoff seeding.\nStock up after the win: Defensive coordinator Mike Caldwell. The Bills averaged 41 points in their previous three games, but Caldwell called perhaps his best game of the past two seasons by being aggressive. The Jaguars blitzed Josh Allen on 32% of his dropbacks (12 of 37) and Allen completed just 4 of 11 passes for 41 yards on those plays.\nStock down after the win: The offensive line. It continues to be a major issue, with penalties by Anton Harrison (two) and Brandon Scherff, a bad snap by Luke Fortner, and whiffs by Cam Robinson that stalled drives, stole points and resulted in turnovers. -- Mike DiRocco\nNext game: vs. Colts (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWas this offensive performance a one-off or something that will be an issue going forward? There's reason for concern, but not alarm. Jet lag isn't to blame for a Bills offense (which had scored 37 or more points in the previous three games) being held to 20 points. The Bills gave up on the running game, finishing with only 13 carries for 29 yards. Quarterback Josh Allen also struggled with pressure, resulting in an inability to sustain long drives. It's nothing that can't be corrected, but a lack of balance can't become a theme.\nStock up after the loss: AJ Epenesa. With the Bills dealing with multiple injuries at defensive end, Epenesa stepped up with a strip sack and fumble recovery, two total sacks, three tackles and three batted passes -- becoming the first player since J.J. Watt in 2014 to have two sacks and three batted passes in a game.\nStock down after the loss: The linebacking corps. The Bills lost Matt Milano to a knee injury in the first quarter. The defense allowed Jacksonville to march up and down the field, dominate time of possession and rush for over 150 yards. -- Alaina Getzenberg\nNext game: vs. Giants (Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET)\nGeorge Pickens hauls in the dime from Kenny Pickett to give the Steelers a 14-10 lead late in the fourth quarter.\n\nWill the Bears commit their offensive identity around DJ Moore? Justin Fields has appeared his most comfortable when targeting Moore, who accounted for 230 receiving yards and three touchdowns against Washington. The wide receiver's 141 yards after the catch accounted for half of Fields' passing yardage, and the quarterback has looked more polished as a passer in the Bears' past two games. Fields pointed out how often he saw Moore one-on-one with a Washington defender, which should change against better defenses. How Fields adjusts to those changes will speak to the direction of the offense.\nStock up after the win: Teven Jenkins. The Bears left guard was activated off injured reserve hours before Chicago's win and kept Washington's stout DT duo in check while playing on a snap count.\nStock down after the win: The running backs. Chicago was down to fullback Khari Blasingame against the Commanders after losing Khalil Herbert, Roschon Johnson and Travis Homer because of in-game injuries. -- Courtney Cronin\nNext game: at Falcons (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nAfter such an ugly loss, where's the hope? Quarterback Sam Howell has played two productive games in a row, throwing for a combined 678 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. He has posted a 79.4 quarterback rating in the past two games combined on third downs. If the defense ever gets turned around, Washington can gain momentum. After five games last season, the defense ranked 25th in points and 17th in yards; it finished seventh and third, respectively. Without another turnaround, jobs will be lost.\nStock up after the loss: DE Chase Young. While the defense in general has struggled, Young had a season-high 36.4 percent pass rush win rate vs. Chicago, and he now has three sacks in four games.\nStock down after the loss: The defense. Washington surrendered five plays of 25 yards or more against Chicago, giving the Commanders an NFL-high 16 such plays for the season.

(0:58)\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- If Sunday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers was supposed to be a measuring stick for the Dallas Cowboys, then the gap between the teams is ginormous.\nSan Francisco pinned a 42-10 loss on the Cowboys at Levi's Stadium that left their locker room as silent as it was in January, when the Niners ended Dallas' season in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\"Didn't see it coming,\" Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said. \"Put everything into it and got punched in the mouth. Called it a couple weeks ago humbling against Arizona, but this may be the most humbling I've ever been a part of. Felt good about the preparation and felt good about everything, honestly, coming into this game, matchups, and they beat us in every aspect.\"\nIt was the second-worst loss of Mike McCarthy's head-coaching career; only a 35-0 shutout against the New England Patriots in his first year with the Green Bay Packers in 2006 was worse. It was the largest defeat of Prescott's career, going back to a 39-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Nov. 19, 2017, during his second season as the Cowboys' starting quarterback.\n\"It's a punch in the gut, it's a kick in the ass, whatever phrase you want to put on it,\" McCarthy said. \"We've been knocked down, clearly. They beat us in all three phases. We will clearly acknowledge it. I've never been a burn-the-tape guy. I think that is a crock of s---. We're going to go through it, make sure we're clear on exactly what the expectations are and make sure we're giving the players what they need to be successful. They played extremely well, and we did not.\n\"I thought we had taken a step as a team. I didn't see this coming. I thought the prep was good this week. I thought we had one of our better Friday and Saturdays of the year. But it's like we talked about before: Sometimes you have a great week of preparation and it doesn't go so well. We did not hit the mark at all.\"\nA defense that allowed a league-low 10.3 points per game through four weeks gave up 21 points through six possessions. A defense that allowed two touchdown passes in the first four games saw Brock Purdy throw four. A defense that recorded 14 sacks in four games sacked Purdy just once. The run defense was hit for 170 yards and two touchdowns on 41 carries.\nOffensively, it was worse for the Cowboys. Prescott completed 14 of 24 passes for 153 yards and one touchdown pass with three interceptions before he was pulled with 8:47 left to play. Running back Tony Pollard lost his first fumble since 2019, his rookie year, in the first quarter. Of the 11 possessions with Prescott at quarterback, nine of them lasted three plays or fewer.\n\"I don't foresee a whole lot of winning grades coming out of this performance,\" McCarthy said. \"I think the most important thing for all of us, and I expressed it, just be accountable for what you did tonight, how you played. We've got to clean our own house up.\"\nThe Cowboys also lost linebacker Leighton Vander Esch in the fourth quarter to a neck injury. Receiver KaVontae Turpin, who scored their only touchdown, did not return following a second-quarter ankle injury. Special teams ace C.J. Goodwin exited in the first half after sustaining a shoulder injury.\n\"This game is not indicative of who we are as an offense,\" Dallas left guard Tyler Smith said. \"This game isn't indicative of who we are as a defense. It's not indicative of who we are as a team.\"\nThe Cowboys will return to California next week for \"Monday Night Football\" against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\"It's still early in the season,\" Dallas linebacker Micah Parsons said. \"I need to help bring these guys together, and we just need to get better. There's no such thing as losing. So tonight we just learned a lesson. We were the team at the end of the stick.\"\nThe Cowboys have dropped their past three matchups with the 49ers, including twice in the postseason.\nFor the 10th time since Jerry Jones took over as owner and general manager in 1989 the Cowboys are 3-2; three times they failed to make the playoffs, including 2019.\nOn Sunday, the gap between the Cowboys and the Niners -- who along with the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas' NFC East rivals, are undefeated -- looked wider than ever.\n\"I mean, obviously, they're further ahead than us right now,\" Prescott said of the 49ers. \"Yeah, so we've got to close that gap and be ready. To get to where we want to get, we know we're going to have to go through this team and most likely come back to this place.\""}

His right shoulder took the brunt of the impact as he fell to the turf, and he immediately reacted by pointing to the shoulder as he lay on the ground.\nRichardson did not return to the game and was replaced by Gardner Minshew, who completed 11 of 14 passes for 155 yards and helped the Colts (3-2) hold on for the victory.\nIt marks the latest health concern for Richardson, who was the No. 4 pick in this year's draft and has left three games early because of injury.\nRichardson was pulled from the season opener against Jacksonville after taking a hit to his knee, and he missed Indianapolis' Week 3 contest against the Ravens after suffering a concussion against the Texans in the previous game."}

(0:18)\nDENVER -- Facing the team that fired him and the coach who maligned him in print, New York Jets offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett enjoyed a day of sweet revenge as his unit racked up 407 total yards Sunday in a 31-21 victory over the Denver Broncos at Empower Field.\nHackett was presented a game ball in a raucous winning locker room, where he was cheered and mobbed by players. He spoke briefly to the team, refusing to gloat or accept any credit. The players did that for him, describing how they badly they wanted to make him a winner.\n\"If someone talks s--- about one of us or one of our coaches or anybody in the building, we want to have their back,\" tight end C.J. Uzomah said. \"So this one was for Hack.\"\nHackett was called out in training camp by Broncos coach Sean Payton, who told USA Today that the 2022 Broncos were undermined by \"one of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the NFL.\" Hackett was fired with a 4-11 record in his first season.\n\nHe didn't mention the Payton comments during the run-up to the game, players said, but it was on their minds. Before the game, Uzomah gathered his offensive teammates in the end zone and delivered a fiery, profanity-laced pep talk, taking direct aim at Payton.\nIn his brief speech -- caught on video and posted on social media -- Uzomah accused Payton of making the game \"personal.\" After dropping a couple of expletives, he implored his teammates, \"Let's go win this b---- for Hackett!\"\nHackett wasn't available to the media after the win, which snapped a three-game losing streak for the Jets (2-3), but it had to be enormously satisfying. It wasn't an artistic offensive performance -- the Jets were 0-for-5 in the red zone -- but they pounded away at Denver's soft run defense.\nSparked by Breece Hall, who rushed for a career-high 177 yards (including a 72-yard touchdown), the Jets amassed 234 on the ground. Coach Robert Saleh called it \"a special game\" for Hackett and, even though he didn't poke Payton or the Broncos, he made sure mention the Jets' exact yardage total -- 407.\nSpeaking of Hackett, linebacker Quincy Williams told reporters, \"Put some respect on my dog's name.\"\nPayton, who shook Saleh's hand at midfield and then retreated immediately to his locker room, didn't have much to say afterward.\n\"Listen, they played better than us,'' Payton said. \"I credit Robert and that staff, they won the game, that's how I look at it.''\nAsked if he regrets making the comments in late July, Payton said, \"I already addressed that, though it's a fair question. I addressed that the next day.\" At the time, he said it was \"a mistake\" to criticize Hackett in that fashion.\nPayton's postgame news conference ended with that question. With a pause between questions, he took the opportunity to leave the room.\nA month after getting fired by the Broncos, Hackett took the Jets job and was instrumental in luring Aaron Rodgers to the team. When Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 1, it intensified the spotlight on Hackett, whose offense sputtered in the first three games. There was improvement in Week 4, but New York fell to the Kansas City Chiefs 23-20.\nFinally, Hackett was able to enjoy a winning smile.\n\"Even if he wasn't telling us, 'This is personal to me,' you could just look how he carried himself all week, you know what I mean?\" cornerback Sauce Gardner said. \"He had that look on his face, like, man, he really wanted this game. So it meant a lot to get a win for him.\"\nIt wasn't easy. Leading by only three points, Zach Wilson threw an interception deep in Denver territory with 2:14 left in the fourth quarter. With a chance to beat his former coach, Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson coughed it up on a strip sack by Williams. Cornerback Bryce Hall, starting his first game since 2021, scooped up the ball and ran 39 yards for the clinching touchdown.\nNot only did they save their season, but the Jets gave their offensive coordinator a forever moment.\n\"It was a tiny little cherry on top of a huge sundae,\" center Connor McGovern said.\nOr Sunday.\nESPN's Jeff Legwold contributed to this report.

(0:27)\nMINNEAPOLIS -- As he walked through the locker room Sunday evening, Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell stopped to chat with receiver Justin Jefferson. He threw his arm around Jefferson's shoulders, leaned in closely and spoke a few encouraging words into his ear.\nIt was the kind of conversation no coach wants to have. O'Connell's star player left Sunday's 27-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs after a fourth-quarter injury to his right hamstring, and it's a worrisome turn of events for a team that runs its entire offense through him.\nO'Connell said that it's \"still very early\" to project a timetable for Jefferson's recovery -- or if he'd miss any time at all -- but a hamstring injury for a player at his position can be problematic.\n\"We'll get him back as soon as we possibly can,\" O'Connell said. \"There won't be a better teammate in that locker room during the time [he is out]. Hopefully we have him right back this week.\"\nJefferson, who declined comment, hasn't missed a game since the Vikings made him their first-round draft pick in 2020, and he has rarely missed a snap during that period. Since joining the starting lineup in Week 3 of his rookie season, Jefferson has made 53 consecutive starts while playing 92% of the Vikings' offensive snaps.\n\"Justin has done a phenomenal job for the last 3½ years of staying healthy and being healthy every week, which is hard to do,\" quarterback Kirk Cousins said. \"Even with this injury, it makes you pause and be grateful for how healthy he has been.\"\nSunday was Jefferson's quietest day of the season. Cousins targeted him six times, but he dropped one pass -- only his second in the past two seasons -- and caught only three for 28 yards. The injury occurred midway through the fourth quarter when he stumbled while making a cut on a route.\nEntering Week 5, the Vikings had targeted Jefferson on 47 passes, third most in the NFL. Their next-most targeted receiver was rookie Jordan Addison, who had been targeted 20 times. (Tight end T.J. Hockenson ranked second on the team with 31 targets.) Addison, the Vikings' first-round pick, caught a career-high six passes for 69 yards and a touchdown Sunday.\n\"Jordan is the real deal,\" Cousins said. \"We hit on that draft pick. He's a great player. He's the real deal. Great hands, runs great routes. I've played with some really good skill groups in my career. Fortunate enough to do that. When I look at our group right now, it's as good as I've ever been with.\"\nVeteran receivers K.J. Osborn and Brandon Powell would also expect to see increased targets if Jefferson misses any time. O'Connell, however, said the Vikings could go in a number of different directions in that scenario.\n\"We've got some guys that are here for a reason,\" O'Connell said. \"And the beauty of having [fullback] C.J. Ham and three tight ends and multiple backs is we can reinvent ourselves in whatever way we feel is the best way to move the ball and try to score points.\""}

(0:45)\nBALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles are one game away from playoff elimination, but they can perhaps take solace in one of the most impressive aspects of their 101-win season: They weren't swept in a series all season. Indeed, they haven't been swept in a series since catcher Adley Rutschman was called up in late May of 2022.\n\"It's a pretty significant feat to go that long without it happening,\" outfielder Austin Hays said following Sunday's 11-8 loss to the Texas Rangers in Game 2 of the American League Division Series. \"I think it's a byproduct of us being able to always turn the page and move on from what happened the day before. Just reset and focus on the next game.\"\nOf course, the Orioles will not need to just avoid a sweep. They'll have to win three games in a row to move on. They'll also have to do it after a poor pitching performance on Sunday. Orioles pitchers walked 11 batters, including Corey Seager a postseason-record five times. Eight pitchers combined to throw 206 pitches. Rookie starter Grayson Rodriguez, who had been so good in the second half with a 2.58 ERA, struggled with his fastball command and got knocked out in a five-run second inning, issuing four walks and six hits while recording just five outs.\nMitch Garver added a third-inning grand slam to give the Rangers a 9-2 lead, and a late Baltimore rally in the ninth inning fell short.\n\"Our backs are against the wall right now, and tonight wasn't our best night on the mound,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We haven't played our two best games here. We played well on the road all year, so hopefully we can play well on the road.\"\nThe odds are against the Orioles mounting a series comeback. The Rangers are the 32nd team to win the first two games of a best-of-five series on the road; 28 of the previous 31 went on to win the series.\n\"There is no tomorrow. I feel like that's how our team played all year, honestly,\" Hays said. \"We're just going to play with our hair on fire and win three in a row.\"\nRodriguez came out firing: His first pitch was 100 mph. He escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first inning, but his inability to get ahead of hitters came back to bite him in the second inning.\n\"I was just spraying fastballs and not hitting the zone consistently, so it was just not working for me,\" Rodriguez said. \"We were trying to be aggressive and induce early contact, make them put them on the ground, that was the goal.\"\nHyde brought in reliever Bryan Baker to start the third inning. Baker had last pitched for the Orioles on Sept. 15 -- after which he was sent down to Triple-A. He made two appearances there, allowing seven runs over 1⅔ innings. He faced four batters and walked three of them. Jacob Webb, who served up a home run in Game 1 to Josh Jung, entered to face Garver, and Garver slugged a 3-1 fastball for the grand slam.\n\"In the third inning, I had a lot of game left,\" Hyde said. \"Started with Baker against the bottom of the order there, I was hoping he'd give us an inning. That didn't work out.\"\nAlso not working out: solving Seager, the Rangers' best hitter, who hit .317/.390/.623 and walked twice in Game 1 and went 4-for-8 with two walks and three doubles in the two-game wild-card sweep of the Rays. Seager walked on six pitches against Rodriguez in the first inning, walked on another full count in the second, walked on five pitches against Baker in the third, walked on five pitches against Jack Flaherty in the fifth and drew his hard-earned record-breaking fifth walk after a nine-pitch battle against Yennier Cano in the ninth inning.\nSeventeen times in postseason history a player had drawn four walks in a game -- including David Ortiz twice -- but Seager became the first with a five-walk game.\n\"He's a really good hitter, so we're trying to be careful,\" Rutschman said. \"We want to try to execute our game plan, but it probably just has to be a little more precise with him, so that probably led to more walks.\"\nSeager isn't normally known for his patience.\n\"We know he likes to swing the bat,\" Garver said. \"I think it was his fifth at-bat and he chased a 2-0 heater that was above his eyes. So I think at that point he kind of wanted to hit.\"\nAs impressive as the Rangers have looked in their four postseason games -- they're hitting .272/.376/.456 and have scored 25 runs -- those four games were all on the road. They return home for the first time after two weeks -- and they love to hit at Globe Life Field, where they hit 53 more home runs than they did on the road. It might be a tough order for the Orioles to avoid their first sweep of the season."}

Watt recovers a fumble on one drive and ends the Ravens' hopes on the next possession with a sack on fourth down (0:54)\nAfter a blowout loss in London six years ago, the Baltimore Ravens are taking a much different route to England this time.\nThe Ravens headed overseas Monday morning, which marks the earliest a team has traveled for an international game this year. The Atlanta Falcons, Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills all left on Thursday for their London games this season.\nBaltimore decided to fly out six days before its game against the Tennessee Titans because of a forgettable experience in 2017. In the Ravens' only international game in franchise history, the team flew out on Thursday night and got routed by the Jaguars 44-7. The 37-point loss is the second-largest margin of defeat in an NFL international game.\n\"It's mostly driven by the fact that we didn't do well, so we did the opposite,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said when asked about leaving early in the week. \"There's no data -- and we looked for it -- to say when you should go out there and what's the ideal thing. I'll say this kind of in jest, what's the science on that? As often is the case, they really don't know. That's just the way it is.\"\nThe Titans are flying out Thursday after practice.\nHeaded across the pond ✈️@ZIPSCleaners pic.twitter.com/cZK4ehlMFJ\nBy spending the entire week in London, the Ravens will temporarily move their entire operations across the pond.\n\"The good thing about it is I personally don't have to worry about any of that. I just expect it to be perfect,\" Harbaugh said with a smile. \"They do a great job. You got the video, you got the medical, you got the equipment, you got all those things -- you got the computer stuff. As coaches and players, all we really have to do is go out there and focus on preparing and getting ready for the game.\"\nThis is a quick turnaround for the Ravens (3-2). Baltimore left for England about 12 hours after landing back from Pittsburgh, where the Ravens fell to the Steelers 17-10 on Sunday.\nBut the Ravens are banking on being fully adjusted for Sunday's game, which kicks off at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\"Hopefully, by the time the game comes around ... We've slept there six nights. You'd like to think we'll be pretty well ready to go,\" Harbaugh said. \"I think that's probably a big part of the decision to try and do it this way. Other teams go in there and say, 'OK, we're not going to mess with it. We'll just stay on our own clock and play at 9:30 [British time] and we'll get in and out. We don't have to deal with it.

(1:33)\nChicago Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson knows he has something special in Connor Bedard, the No. 1 pick in this year's NHL draft.\n\"He's been exactly as advertised,\" Davidson told ESPN entering Tuesday's NHL season opener. \"He's everything we thought he would be on the ice in terms of skill, the hockey sense, the highlight reel moves. The only thing he hasn't done is beat a goalie yet, which I'm sure is eating him up. But it will come.\"\nThe rookie led the Blackhawks through the preseason with five points (one goal, four assists) in four games -- though the goal was an empty netter. Bedard was also poke-checked on a shootout attempt by Minnesota Wild goalie Marc-Andre Fleury after trying some slick moves.\nBedard, 18, has also turned heads with some crafty plays in practice and preseason games, which has the entire league talking about him and his ability to live up to his pre-draft hype.\nHe is expected to center the Blackhawks' top line -- flanked by veterans Taylor Hall and Ryan Donato -- on Tuesday, when Chicago opens on the road against the Pittsburgh Penguins (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) and his childhood idol, Sidney Crosby.\nCrosby immediately became the Penguins' best player in his 2005-06 rookie season, leading the team with 102 points in 81 games. Though Davidson was hesitant to make specific predictions for Bedard, he's expecting a similar transformative impact.\n\"He's going to be a big driver of our offense. He's going to be a big part of our team just walking in,\" Davidson said. \"As far as stat and goal totals, I really don't have a feel for that. But he's going to be a driver of impact for our team right away.\"\nBedard has expressed frustration after losses in the preseason, and he didn't celebrate much after his empty net goal. Davidson said he's hoping the coaching staff and veteran players will help Bedard adjust to the ebbs and flows of pro hockey.\nThe Blackhawks brought in several respected veterans including Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry to help usher Bedard's transition from junior hockey.\nBedard played last season for the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League, scoring 71 goals and 143 goals in 57 games against his peers in his age group.\n\"It's also up to us to temper expectations a little bit. This isn't junior hockey anymore; there's going to be a transition phase,\" Davidson said. \"I think he gets that. He's not walking in here expecting to put up the same amount of points or goals as junior hockey. But he also holds himself up to a high standard and you also don't want to take that intensity away from a player because that's what makes him great.\"\nThe Blackhawks are a team in transition after parting with Stanley Cup stalwarts Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews in the past year. The team has made the playoffs just once since 2017.\nWhen asked where the Blackhawks were in their rebuild, Davidson answered simply: \"We're in Year 2.\"\n\"It's hard to say where we're at,\" Davidson added. \"We got a great victory with [winning] the lottery. That definitely helped. But where we're at in terms of a stage, it's a build stage. We're still early days. We've really got only one full season under my belt. [Coach] Luke [Richardson] is in his second season. We're only starting to see some of our first draft classes break into the NHL. We've got a lot of players that are going to be a key part of this that aren't in pro hockey yet.\"\nDavidson said he is just hoping for growth, and a commitment to playing a certain style under Richardson. He also reiterated that the team is not directed to tank, and he'd be more than happy with a surprise playoff berth.\n\"You come to the rink, you better come to win,\" Davidson said. \"That's what we all expect. You need to develop a positive culture. But what we're trying to build here is something sustainable.\"\nThe Blackhawks are also welcoming another key player to their opening day lineup: Lukas Reichel, 21, their 2020 first-round pick.\n\"We gave him a pretty big summer project: show us that you want to be a centerman, and put in the work both on and off the ice,\" Davidson said. \"He's played really responsibly, especially in the defensive zone. He had a great camp.\"\nThough Reichel is waiver-exempt, Davidson said fans should expect to see him in a prominent NHL role. The German-born forward will begin opening night as the No. 2 center, slotted behind Bedard.\n\"[Reichel] is beyond the point of needing AHL time,\" Davidson said. \"He's going to be with us moving forward here.\""}

(1:59)\nLAS VEGAS -- Coach Becky Hammon said her Las Vegas Aces gave themselves a \"D\" grade for how they played in the first half of Sunday's Game 1 WNBA Finals matchup with the New York Liberty. Hammon thought that might have been a bit harsh. The Aces were down only three points at halftime. She gave them a C-minus.\nBut when the Aces came out of the locker room, they turned things around into an A by Hammon's standards.\nLas Vegas outscored New York by 20 points across the final 20 minutes, at one point extending its lead to as many as 22 points, for a 99-82 victory to go up 1-0 in the best-of-five series against the Liberty.\nNew York, which is seeking its first WNBA title and playing in its first Finals since 2002, will try to even the series Wednesday (9 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN App).\nHow did the Aces turn it around? Let's take a look at what went right for the Aces, who are looking to become the league's first repeat champions since 2001-02, and what the Liberty need to improve in Game 2.\nMuch had been made about the star power in this matchup, including the guards: The Aces' Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young are former No. 1 picks (in 2017 and 2019, respectively), as is the Liberty's Sabrina Ionescu (2020). Chelsea Gray and Courtney Vandersloot will go down as two of the best point guards the league has ever seen.\nOn Sunday, Plum, Young and Gray were \"pretty ridiculous,\" Hammon said, combining for 72 of the Aces' 99 points while containing New York's backcourt as well: Marine Johannes had 14 points off the bench, but Ionescu and Vandersloot were limited to 17 points collectively. Betnijah Laney, who had scored at least 19 points in New York's five postseason victories, also had a quiet game with 11.\n\"They just had a little bit of a tough night,\" Brondello said of her guards. \"That's not going to happen two games in a row.\"\nWith so much attention dedicated to slowing down two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, as well as Gray running the point, Plum and Young believed they had opportunities to thrive. And they took advantage of them.\n\"How do you eat an elephant?\" Hammon said, referring to the problems Stewart and Jonquel Jones pose in the paint. \"One bite at a time, or invite your friends. So we invited our friends.\"\nHeading into the series, Hammon identified Young as the X factor, and the guard showed her importance early and often in Game 1, finishing with 26 points (5-for-8 shooting from 3), five rebounds, four assists and three steals. Her defense on Ionescu was just as important, if not even more critical: Ionescu had previously scored at least 22 points against the Aces three times this season, but she was held to seven Sunday (2-for-7 from field, 1-for-5 from 3).\n\"I thought [Ionescu] over the course of the five games that we had played them, she's been ridiculous,\" Hammon said. \"So I just challenged [Young] to take that head on, and they like challenges.\"\nChelsea Gray finds Jackie Young wide open on a backdoor pass to give the Aces a layup.\nThe flip side? The Liberty were a step too slow on the defensive end of the floor, whether it was allowing Young and Gray to get going from 3 or giving Plum easy looks at the rim. Las Vegas shot 54.7% from the floor, including 40.9% from beyond the arc.\n\"One-on-one defense was critical for us, and they got the upper hand in this game,\" Brondello said. \"We've got to make them work a little bit harder. There were too many open layups at the rim.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nNew York has greatly improved on defense over the course of the season, and had twice held the Aces below 70 points, but it seemed to lose traction on that end as the game progressed. The Liberty guards will have to step up here as well.\nThe Aces' second-half defense was \"as good as I've ever seen it,\" Brondello said, and their ability to get stops helped fuel their offense. New York saw moments when the ball stuck and movement slowed down, which allowed the Aces to thrive off clogging the paint.\n\"We just did it,\" Wilson said of the team's improved defense in the second half. \"We lost all the pressure. Everything was just off of our shoulders because we knew what was at stake. So I don't think we created any crazy scheme. We just did our job.\n\"And Becky always tells us, 'If everyone's doing their job at the same time, we're good in that space.'\"\nCoaches love the adage \"defense wins championships,\" and when it comes to a battle of two typically high-powered offenses, whichever team is better on the other end of the floor will likely emerge as champion.\nMarine Johannes hits two off-balance 3-pointers as the Liberty try to hold off the Aces.\nHammon said she's a fan of Johannes, whose one-legged, off-balance 3-point shooting was on full display in the first half Sunday. Johannes had scored only five points in the postseason entering the game, not playing as much in the earlier rounds in such physical series.\nThe Aces held her scoreless in the second half, but it'll be fascinating to see how the Liberty use her in the coming games, especially depending on what production they get out of their other guards.\nJonquel Jones nearly had a double-double in the first half with 12 points and nine boards -- a big reason the Liberty led at the half -- before adding just four points and one rebound across the final 20 minutes.\nLas Vegas won the battle on the glass (plus-6 in the second half), and the Aces' ability to contain Jones's production in both the paint and on the boards neutralized one of the greatest matchup problems New York boasts. Jones is the first player to compile seven double-doubles in a single postseason, but the Liberty will need a full 40 minutes from her to swing the momentum.\nFans thought they were finally getting a close battle between these two superteams when the score was tight in the first half, but the Aces' strong start to the third carried over into a fourth that didn't have much intrigue.\nBut if there's one thing Brondello stresses about her coaching style, it's that she never gets too high or too low -- and that's what she has tried to instill in her team all season.\nOne of the best examples of that: New York hasn't lost back-to-back games all season. Even after losing by 15 points in Game 1 of the semifinals against the Connecticut Sun, the Liberty rebounded to win three straight, including two contests on the road at Mohegan Sun Arena.\nCan that streak extend into Wednesday, against an Aces team that hasn't lost in the playoffs and is two victories away from winning another title?\n\"We're going to know that we respond in the right way, and I trust these players,\" Brondello said. \"And we're going to keep competing and fighting.\""}
{"title": "Oklahoma turns back the clock in Red River triumph", "date": "2023-10-09 15:28:51", "text": "After Texas takes the lead late, Dillon Gabriel comes up huge on the final drive, giving Oklahoma the Red River Rivalry win. (1:44)\nDALLAS -- Let's set the scene for Oklahoma: The Sooners and their second-year coach are in need of a signature win, with the rival Longhorns providing a golden opportunity. A smooth, lefty quarterback delivers the victory that springboards him into the Heisman Trophy race and the team into the national title discussion.\nThe year is 2000, coach Bob Stoops and QB Josh Heupel have dismantled Texas 63-14 and end up winning it all that season.\nOn Saturday, the Sooners didn't blow Texas out of the water in their 34-30 win. But a year after suffering the biggest loss to the Longhorns in school history, a 49-0 humiliation, this year's lefty signal-caller, Dillon Gabriel, landed a devastating knockout blow with a five-play, 62-second game-winning touchdown drive that delivered a statement of its own: The Sooners have their swagger back, and it feels an awful lot like it did 23 years ago.\nEchoes of 2000? Don't take our word for it. Listen to someone who was there.\n\"It reminds me a little bit of that, 1999 to 2000,\" Oklahoma coach Brent Venables said Saturday afternoon. \"No offense to these guys, but we had a bunch of misfits back in 2000. We didn't know how good we could be.\"\nVenables was a second-year Oklahoma assistant in 2000. He had arrived with Bob Stoops a year before, taking over a humbled Oklahoma program that had gone 5-6 the year before under John Blake, the last season of Blake's 12-22 three-year tenure.\nVenables was also a first-year head coach in 2022, who went 6-7, the Sooners' first losing season since Blake's last. He took over after the shocking departure of Lincoln Riley for USC and the transfer of several key players, including Caleb Williams, who won the Heisman Trophy last season, and Spencer Rattler, another former starting QB. Then Texas happened. Fairly or not, it's the kind of loss that starts raising questions about whether the Sooners had landed the right coach.\nVenables just coached in his 15th Red River Rivalry. He knows the rules at Oklahoma. Start 0-2 against the Longhorns and those questions start getting louder. That hasn't happened since Gary Gibbs lost his first two in 1989 and 1990.\nThe 2022 Sooners lost at home to Kansas State and Baylor. They were blown out by TCU on the road early in the year and lost four games, including the Cheez-It Bowl against Florida State, by a field goal. They ranked 122nd out of 131 nationally in total defense. But most importantly, they were humiliated at the Cotton Bowl.\n\"My hands are all over that, and the players that played for us last year, they were hurt from that too,\" Venables said. \"Ultimately, my job as a leader is to get the best out of them, and I did a very poor job of that.\"\nThese Sooners started the season at No. 20 with a lot of questions. Venables said before the season that 76% of his roster would be first- and second-year players. The defensive line alone added six transfers. The Sooners signed seven ESPN 300 defensive recruits, their most since the rankings began in 2006. The defensive line came up big in a dramatic goal-line stand, stuffing Texas four times at the 1. Peyton Bowen, one of the gems of that recruiting class, forced a fumble on a big hit on Quinn Ewers in the third quarter.\nThe Sooners are now 6-0 and look more like the Oklahoma that won six straight Big 12 championships before that run ended last season. Baker Mayfield was on the sideline Saturday throwing the horns down on the stadium video screen, and the Sooners took Texas' best shot and conjured another helping of Sooner Magic. There's a swagger back to these Sooners.\n\"That [2000 team] was a group, they were tough as all get-out and they'd raggedy up and they just came every day and went to work. And these guys have been exactly that. We're a little shinier in some spots,\" Venables said, glancing to his right to star linebacker Danny Stutsman. \"But also, I think the parallels are that you didn't know how good we can be.\"\nThere's a belief now in Norman. That's the hard part in any coaching change. Like in 2000, Venables has returned the Sooners to the top 10 and they will now be back in the national conversation. Amid a struggling Big 12 field, it looks as if the Sooners and Longhorns are on another collision course for December in a conference title rematch.\nAt midfield Saturday after the game, Venables put on the golden hat and handed it off to his players, with a sense of gratitude.\nWhat a difference one game makes.\n\"There's no limits on what this team can do, and no excuses either,\" Venables said. \"We've got everything that we need.\""}

Won the Stanley Cup.\nStanley Cup odds: +1200\nKey players added: None\nKey players lost: F Teddy Blueger, G Laurent Brossoit, F Phil Kessel, G Jonathan Quick, F Reilly Smith\nMost fascinating player: Ivan Barbashev. The Golden Knights' trade for Barbashev provided a major boost to their Cup run, as he posted six goals and 10 assists in 23 regular-season games and another seven goals and 13 assists in the playoffs. He was slated to be an unrestricted free agent, and in order to keep him (he signed a five-year contract worth $5 million annually), they had to part with one of the remaining original Golden Knights in Reilly Smith. The Golden Knights are counting on Barbashev -- a four-time double-digit scorer -- to continue to be a productive two-way forward who can be trusted in all situations.\nBest case: They win the Stanley Cup for a second year in a row.\nWorst case: Falling short of the title, along with the reasons why. So much of the formula behind the Golden Knights' success was rooted in being multifaceted. They had the depth that allowed them to rely on all four lines and all three defensive pairings for offensive contributions. They had a defensive structure that saw them limit some of the game's most talented players to zero points in the playoffs, as well as the depth that saw players like goaltender Adin Hill go from being a member of the regular-season rotation to one of the main reasons for winning the Cup.\nX factor: Part of the challenge in being a defending champion is finding enough players on team-friendly deals who can serve in key roles. That makes what the Knights have done at the AHL level even more vital. Homegrown talents such as Nicolas Hague, Keegan Kolesar, Logan Thompson and Zach Whitecloud are proof that they've been able to develop key contributors on team-friendly deals. It was the case last season, when Paul Cotter, who did not see action in the postseason, still contributed 13 goals while playing in a bottom-six role. Cotter is expected to take on a greater role this season, and it's possible the Golden Knights could ask their next wave of homegrown talents to do the same.\n\nFantasy outlook: Jack Eichel appears in solid shape after a stretch of serious injury concerns. As demonstrated by his performance on route to winning the Knights' first Cup, the club's top center is more than capable of eclipsing the 85-point mark, while averaging close to four shots per contest.\nBold prediction: Logan Thompson reclaims the crease.\nLast season: 51-24-7, 109 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +900\nKey players added: F Ross Colton, F Jonathan Drouin, F Ryan Johansen, F Miles Wood\nKey players lost: F J.T. Compher, F Lars Eller, F Darren Helm, D Erik Johnson, F Denis Malgin, F Alex Newhook, F Evan Rodrigues\nMost fascinating player: Cale Makar. Injuries throughout the lineup forced the Avalanche to make adjustments. One of them was asking Makar to take on more, which is why he led the NHL in average ice time (26:22 per game), which meant he had to pick and choose his spots to attack. Having a healthier roster along with more secondary and tertiary scoring options could help Makar become more of an offensive threat. Injuries limited Makar to 60 games, but he still averaged more than a point per game, almost matching his output from the previous season, when he won the Norris.\nBest case: Winning their second Stanley Cup in three seasons is the mission for the Avs. They have built a core around Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen, Devon Toews, Valeri Nichushkin, Samuel Girard and Artturi Lehkonen, who were part of their 2021-22 title-winning team. Injuries and a lack of scoring depth were stumbling blocks in their bid to repeat last season. Like any Cup contender, salary-cap limitations forced the Avs to part with players such as J.T. Compher and Evan Rodrigues in free agency and Alex Newhook via trade. Yet like any Cup contender, they got creative with their cap space and made the necessary moves to provide more options to supplement their core with captain Gabriel Landeskog slated to miss a second straight season while recovering from knee surgery.\nWorst case: A repeat of last season, which saw an injury-riddled campaign end with a first-round playoff exit. Part of what also plagued the Avs was their limited cap space, which made it difficult for them to find replacements for Andre Burakovsky and Nazem Kadri, members of that Cup winning team that left in free agency. Trading draft picks for Ross Colton and Ryan Johansen while signing Jonathan Drouin and Miles Wood in free agency should give the Avs the needed secondary scoring and depth they lacked last season.\nX factor: Could it be Jonathan Drouin? Over the past few seasons, Avs coach Jared Bednar has found results with skilled forwards who joined the team in free agency or via trade. Burakovsky and Kadri had the strongest years of their careers with the Avs, while Nichushkin went from a top-10 pick who struggled to find success with the Dallas Stars to a key top-six forward. Lehkonen is the latest example: The former Canadiens winger finished with his first 20-goal and 50-point season in his first full campaign with the Avs. Is it possible that Drouin will be the next forward who strikes it rich in the Rockies?\n\nFantasy outlook: On the blue line, Makar remains any manager's choice No. 1 defenseman, particularly in leagues that reward power-play points at a premium. Third-year defender Bowen Byram is hoping his first full, healthy season results in a haul near 50 points.\nBold prediction: Cale Makar scores 102 points.\nLast season: 52-21-9, 113 points. Lost in Eastern Conference finals.\nStanley Cup odds: +750\nKey players added: F Michael Bunting, D Dmitry Orlov, D Tony DeAngelo\nKey players lost: D Shayne Gostisbehere\nMost fascinating player: Seth Jarvis. What's the ceiling for Carolina's up-and-comer? He has become a genuine driver within the Hurricanes' offense and plays with control yet the slightly reckless abandon of a skater who wants to keep up with the likes of Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov. Carolina has become known for playing a tight defensive structure and is often pooh-poohed for not being \"exciting\" enough up front. Jarvis can be a catalyst for change there. Now going into this third NHL season and with a solid foundation of growth to build off, this could be a momentum-shifting year for the 21-year-old forward.\nBest case: Carolina finally puts it all together and wins the Cup. Season after season it feels like the Hurricanes have inched closer to that championship version of themselves. For one reason or another it hasn't happened for Carolina, although it came close in making the Eastern Conference finals last spring. Even more impressive was the fact that the Hurricanes reached that stage without Svechnikov, who tore an ACL in March. Svechnikov is healthy again, and assuming he and the club's other top skaters stay that way, the Hurricanes could become the beasts of the East. Michael Bunting was a key offseason signing whom Carolina expects will bring a certain edge -- and skill -- to its top nine, and Dmitry Orlov is a terrific addition to an already great blue line. There's nothing standing in Carolina's way now, right?\nWorst case: More of the same: The Hurricanes dominate the regular season, start well in the postseason and then fizzle out. That would be the biggest disappointment of all. Carolina being swept by Florida in the conference finals was a tough enough pill to swallow. If that letdown doesn't fuel the Hurricanes' fire and propel them to something greater, what will? Carolina has too many good players, and too good a coach in Rod Brind'Amour, to keep letting opportunities to achieve their full potential slip away.\nX factor: Goaltending. Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta are both back and project to be the Hurricanes' tandem once again. Are two aging goaltenders enough for Carolina to reach that aforementioned promised land? Andersen had a strong 2022-23 as the Hurricanes' No. 1 (.903 SV%, 2.48 GAA), but that was only when the 34-year-old was available -- and not battling various injuries. It has been a pattern for Andersen throughout his career. But Carolina is counting on him and Raanta to keep them steady between the pipes. Will they be up to that task?\n\nFantasy outlook: The Hurricanes run six deep on defense, and the top question is whether Brent Burns can repeat again at age 38. As a backup, Tony DeAngelo returns to the club as a potential power-play specialist.\nBold prediction: Brett Pesce isn't traded.\nLast season: 50-23-9, 109 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +900\nKey players added: F Connor Brown, F Mattias Janmark, F Lane Pederson\nKey players lost: F Nick Bjugstad, D Oscar Klefbom, F Klim Kostin, D William Lagesson, D Ryan Murray, F Kailer Yamamoto\nMost fascinating player: Stuart Skinner. What Skinner does in the regular season will clearly carry value. That's how he was able to earn the starting job going into the playoffs. It's just that both he and the Oilers are now at the stage in which what's done in the regular season is overshadowed by what does, or does not, happen in the playoffs. Skinner's maiden postseason came with questions considering he finished with a 3.68 GAA and a .883 save percentage. Those were further amplified in the second round when Skinner was pulled in three of the Oilers' four defeats.\nBest case: Winning the Stanley Cup. This is the expectation for a team that has a pair of Hart Trophy candidates who have combined to win the award in three of the past four seasons: Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid. While it has been a gradual incline from the 2019-20 season, when they reached the qualifying round, the Oilers have done more to strengthen their case as a legitimate Cup contender. They made it to the Western Conference finals in 2021-22, and while their Cup hopes ended in the second round last season, their two most recent exits came at the hands of the teams that would win it all in the Avalanche and the Golden Knights.\nWorst case: Getting eliminated in either the first or second round. What further complicates the Oilers' championship aspirations is where they stand within the conference landscape. They're trying to win a Cup at a time in which the Avs and Golden Knights are the most recent winners, teams such as the Kraken and Stars believe this most recent postseason further legitimized their approach, and changes including trading for Pierre-Luc Dubois could get the Kings beyond the first round. Even then? What makes assessing the Oilers challenging is how recent Cup winners such as the Capitals, Blues, Lightning and Golden Knights all went through some sort of crucible before winning it all. Could that also be the case for the Oilers?\nX factor: How much of a difference will their tactical changes make? The Oilers spent quite a bit of the preseason installing a new neutral-zone system while also changing their defense from man-to-man to zone. One of the questions facing the Oilers throughout the offseason was how do they solve the defensive issues that plagued them in the second round against the Golden Knights? Fixing those issues became a concern given that the Oilers held a one-goal lead in all of their losses to Vegas. Especially considering that the Oilers were in the bottom five among playoff teams in shots allowed per 60, goals allowed per 60 and high-danger chances allowed per 60 in 5-on-5 play.\n\nFantasy outlook: Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (104 points) and Zach Hyman (83) aren't likely to replicate their outstanding numbers from last season, but still have the wherewithal to finish in the top 25 and 35 in scoring, respectively.\nBold prediction: The Oilers will win the Stanley Cup.\nLast season: 52-22-8, 112 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1000\nKey players added: F Tyler Toffoli\nKey players lost: D Damon Severson, D Ryan Graves, G Mackenzie Blackwood\nMost fascinating player: Timo Meier. It's time for Meier to spread his wings in New Jersey. The Devils landed a major prize in trading with San Jose for Meier last season and the forward produced nine goals and 14 points in 21 games for New Jersey after coming aboard. He dealt with injuries though -- in the regular season and again in the playoffs -- so it still seems like New Jersey hasn't seen all of what Meier will eventually offer its offense. GM Tom Fitzgerald got the business side taken care of when he inked Meier to an eight-year contract extension in June. That shows a commitment on both sides to see Meier shine for the Devils. How will that manifest now in the season ahead, when a more established Meier will be playing off the likes of Jack Hughes, Jesper Bratt, Nico Hischier and more?\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBest case: New Jersey is a Cinderella story no more. And that's a good thing. The Devils are just a good team, and they can parlay that into being a great one throughout an 82-game regular season. What's next after that? Playoffs. New Jersey got the satisfaction of beating their rival New York Rangers in a first-round series last April. Best case? That outcome again is just an appetizer for the Devils. Instead of tapping out in the second round, New Jersey wields its way to greater heights on the back of Hughes, Bratt and Meier dominating offensively while Dougie Hamilton & Co. lock down the blue line. Vitek Vanecek performs between the pipes and there's no dip in the Devils' production as they push their way well into the Eastern Conference playoff race.\nWorst case: New Jersey folds under the newfound pressure of being a contender. The Devils won't catch any team off guard this time around and their struggles will be amplified and harder to overcome than they were last season. Frustration settles in when their goaltending tandem of Vanecek and Akira Schmid can't stand up to the tougher competition and even more cracks begin to show. Eventually, the Devils succumb to their own demons and don't even reach the second round.\nX factor: How will New Jersey's blue line adjust without Severson and Graves? Severson was traded to Columbus in June and Graves signed with the Penguins as a free agent. Losing both leaves a defense gap with which the Devils will be grappling. New Jersey can expect only so much development out of Luke Hughes and there's a lot more riding now on Hamilton, John Marino and even Colin Miller to keep New Jersey's defensive game tight. They'll need help from the Devils' forwards, too. Getting beat too easily off the rush has been an issue for New Jersey in the past; if it remains one in their future, that could detract from an otherwise strong season ahead.\n\nFantasy outlook: Vanecek is the 1A starter, but Schmid showed flashes last season. The crease here should generate value regardless, so earning minutes will determine how much value they each have.\nBold prediction: Hischier wins the Selke Trophy.\nLast season: 50-21-11, 111 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1000\nKey players added: F Max Domi, F Tyler Bertuzzi, D John Klingberg, F Ryan Reaves, G Martin Jones\nKey players lost: F Michael Bunting, F Alexander Kerfoot, F Ryan O'Reilly\nMost fascinating player: Ilya Samsonov. What a revelation Samsonov was for the Leafs last season. Signed to a one-year deal with low expectations, the 26-year-old quickly took hold of the No. 1 job and turned in the best performance of his career. Now, after an arbitration hearing with Toronto landed him another one-year pact, can Samsonov do it all over again? His .919 SV% and 2.33 GAA in 2022-23 helped keep Toronto consistent right up to the playoffs -- during which Samsonov suffered an injury that sidelined him in the second round. Had Samsonov been available -- and had the Leafs not been forced to put Joseph Woll in against Florida -- would Toronto have come through that second-round series? Is Samsonov that much of a factor in their success? Could be.\nBest case: Toronto got over the proverbial hump by beating Tampa Bay in the first round of the playoffs last season. Check. Done. So, the Leafs must push forward into the next phase -- and that's being Cup contenders. Toronto has the talent to be a top-five team in the league year after year, and it is. The Leafs' best case is translating all that regular-season success (not to mention optimism) into the playoffs and not being overwhelmed by expectations. General manager Brad Treliving took one major potential distraction off the table by signing Auston Matthews to a four-year extension. And Treliving added some snarl with Ryan Reaves, forward depth in Max Domi and Tyler Bertuzzi, and a solid veteran defender in John Klingberg to bolster the back end. Change can do a team good, and that's what the Leafs are hoping for here.\nWorst case: Another crash and burn in the postseason. The recipe for Toronto is simple: Don't just make the playoffs; make the most of an opportunity when you get there. And that starts with building chemistry early on and sustaining consistent habits all the way through spring. The Leafs know what's expected, and they have enough depth to potentially go all the way. Falling short, again, would have to produce more significant alterations to the team than what it already has gone through over the past three months. Patience, it seems, always runs short in Toronto.\nX factor: William Nylander. Leafs' coach Sheldon Keefe is starting Nylander at center this season instead of on the wing, and that's enough to challenge any skater. However, this also happens to be a contract year for Nylander -- the status for which is already generating headlines of its own. The last time Nylander went up against the Leafs looking for a new deal, it led to a stalemate lasting well into the regular season. Is the uncertainty of what lies ahead for Nylander likely to weigh on him -- or the team -- as this season stretches on? And how will Nylander handle the added responsibilities, game after game, at the center spot? He has done it in short spurts before but never for a sustained period. There's a lot riding on Nylander to perform -- individually and for the entire team.\n\nFantasy outlook: Tyler Bertuzzi feels like a natural replacement for Michael Bunting on the top line and could be in for big fantasy boost with his new linemates.\nBold prediction: Toronto wins two playoff rounds.\nLast season: 47-21-14, 108 points. Lost in Western Conference finals.\nStanley Cup odds: +1500\nKey players added: F Matt Duchene, F Craig Smith, F Sam Steel\nKey players lost: F Max Domi, F Luke Glendening\nMost fascinating player: Miro Heiskanen. He consistently averages ice times that run longer than an episode of \"Abbott Elementary.\" He can take on the challenge of facing a top line while being at the controls of a penalty kill and a power-play unit. And now that he showed he can score more than 70 points in a season, Heiskanen has become too hard to ignore. Heiskanen's all-around performances were one of the reasons the Stars finished a point shy of being the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. It was also one of the reasons they were two wins away from the Stanley Cup Final and went from a wild-card entrant that was knocked out in the first round in 2021-22 to entering the 2023-24 season as a team in a championship window.\nBest case: Finding a way to build upon what they did last season by at least returning to the Western Conference finals. One of the questions facing the Stars prior to last season was whether they had enough offensive production. Under Peter DeBoer, the Stars had nine players who scored more than 10 goals and were sixth in goals scored. That production carried over into the postseason, which is how they were able to overpower the Wild in the first round, outlast the balanced Seattle Kraken in the second round and pose challenges to the team with the strongest depth in the NHL in the eventual Cup champion Golden Knights. Replicating the Stars success from last season would further legitimize that the Stars are in a championship window.\nWorst case: Losing Jake Oettinger to a long-term or season-ending injury. In the span of three seasons, Oettinger has gone from a promising prospect playing in a tandem to being one of the few goaltenders capable of starting more than 60 games at a time in which more NHL teams are using tandems. Oettinger started in 76% of the Stars' regular-season games while leading the league in starts, in addition to being in the top 10 in shots faced and saves. So what would happen in the event something prevented Oettinger from playing for an extended period? The Stars do have veteran Scott Wedgewood, who has 98 games of NHL experience. Beyond that? The two goalies the Stars have under contract throughout their system --- Matt Murray and Remi Poirier -- have a combined three games of NHL experience, with all of them belonging to Murray, who made his debut in 2022-23.\nX factor: It could depend upon the impact made by Thomas Harley and Nils Lundkvist. Part of the offseason discussion about the Stars has centered around their defense, which in itself is a bit of a complex issue. The Stars' defense was among the strongest units in both the regular season and playoffs in several 5-on-5 categories. What makes Harley and Lundkvist players to watch is that they could add more layers to the Stars' defensive dynamic. Harley averaged 0.47 points in the playoffs on a defensive unit that had most of its members average less than 0.31 points in the regular season. A lack of right-handed options is why Heiskanen was moved to the right. That, however, also presents Lundkvist with a chance to potentially challenge Jani Hakanpaa, who is also right-handed, for a top-four role.\n\nFantasy outlook: New to Dallas on a one-year deal, Matt Duchene is in position to kick his production back into gear after last season's humdrum campaign in Nashville. Not to the tune of 83 from 2021-22 but definitely more. Defenseman Miro Heiskanen is, far and away, the Stars' No. 1 fantasy option on the blue line.\nBold prediction: Jake Oettinger wins the Vezina Trophy.\nLast season: 42-32-8, 92 points. Lost in Stanley Cup Final.\nStanley Cup odds: +2000\nKey players added: D Oliver Ekman-Larsson, D Dmitry Kulikov, D Niko Mikkola, D Mike Reilly\nKey players lost: F Anthony Duclair, F Patric Hornqvist, D Radko Gudas, D Marc Staal, G Alex Lyon\nMost fascinating player: Sergei Bobrovsky. Which Bobrovsky will Florida get when the season opens? Will it be the Vezina Trophy-caliber goalie who carried the Panthers in net to an unexpected Stanley Cup Final appearance? Or will Bobrovsky struggle to show up like a $10 million-a-year player should and force Florida into either giving him time to recover or turning the No. 1 job over to someone else? Is there a long leash there from coach Paul Maurice given Bobrovsky's stunning postseason numbers (.915 SV%, 2.78 GAA)? It's been a wild ride for Bobrovsky with the Panthers so far, undulating between excellent and exasperating. We'll see what version of Bobrovsky will show up in 2023-24.\nBest case: Florida was the feel-good story of last season when it defied critics (and oddsmakers) to boldly go into the playoffs and all the way from there to a Cup Final. It would be easy to dismiss the Panthers' success as a one-off feat and assume they won't recreate it. That would be a mistake. If Bobrovsky can pick up where he left off, and if Matthew Tkachuk plays at the Hart Trophy-like level he did for much of the previous eight months and if the plethora of defensemen GM Bill Zito signed to sustain Florida's back end perform well while Aaron Ekblad and Brandon Montour recover from injury, then Florida would (and should) be considered a top contender in the Eastern Conference. The stars have aligned before above these Panthers; there's no reason it can't happen again.\nWorst case: There's a long list of things that will need to go right for Florida to touch the success it had last season. It's not clear how long the Panthers will be without Ekblad and Montour, leaving a gaping hole in the blue line that's even more pronounced now that Radko Gudas has moved on too. If Florida gets run aground defensively and is leaning too heavily on (A) Bobrovsky and (B) the ability to outscore its own issues every night, that doesn't project to end well. The worst case for Florida is it starts slow and falls too far out of postseason reach to make the type of Cinderella run that captivated us all in 2022-23. Going from three wins away from a championship to no playoff opportunity at all would be a tough pill to swallow.\nX factor: Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Someone has to step up for Florida on the back end. Could that be the veteran? This is a pivotal juncture for the 32-year-old player, who was bought out by Vancouver and now joins a young, hungry Panthers team that recently became familiar with winning. That alone should ignite Ekman-Larsson and help bring out his best game, something we haven't seen the most of since he was patrolling Arizona's blue line over five years ago. It's an opportunity to not only massively impact the Panthers' back end but also to show the rest of the league that, at least for the time being, Ekman-Larsson can still be an important player for his team.\n\nFantasy outlook: Injuries to Aaron Ekblad and Brandon Montour will keep the team's two best fantasy defenders on the sidelines until what sounds like November or December. It's a massive opportunity for Gustav Forsling.\nBold prediction: Patrick Kane signs with the Panthers.\nLast season: 47-22-13, 107 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1300\nKey players added: F Blake Wheeler, D Erik Gustafsson, G Jonathan Quick\nKey players lost: F Patrick Kane, F Vladimir Tarasenko, D Niko Mikkola\nMost fascinating player: Igor Shesterkin. Shesterkin is the Rangers' backbone. That's not to say New York isn't more than just goaltending; it is. But the team's success rides heavily on how well Shesterkin performs. There's nothing wrong with that; Shesterkin has the Vezina Trophy to prove how elite his skill set is. And yet, some have deemed his 2022-23 season a \"down\" one, even though Shesterkin collected a .916 SV% and 2.48 GAA. Shesterkin simply couldn't make up for all the Rangers' shortcomings -- but he will be looked at to do so this year anyway. New York is facing a certain amount of transition under new coach Peter Laviolette. Being able to rely on Shesterkin to give New York a chance every night he's in net -- and that'll be most of them -- is something they won't take for granted.\n\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBest case: New York thrives under Laviolette, and the fresh start provided after a couple of disappointing postseason runs. The Rangers revel in Shesterkin's excellent play but also get key contributions from their top six forwards -- led by Artemi Panarin and Mika Zibanejad -- and enjoy another Norris Trophy-type season from Adam Fox on the blue line. The Rangers' young stars -- including Kaapo Kakko -- pop off as significant point producers, and there's no obvious flaws to New York's new system. Not only does the team make the playoffs, but the Rangers find themselves back again in the mix to push beyond just a first-round showing.\nWorst case: The Rangers are counting on depth players like Blake Wheeler and Erik Gustafsson to come in and fill the gaps left behind by exiting skaters. When that doesn't happen, the Rangers' lack of contributors becomes an increasing problem. When Laviolette's tinkering proves unsuccessful, there are questions raised about whether New York was right to even move on from previous bench boss Gerard Gallant. Regardless of how good the Rangers' offensive core is, they can't make up for the team's defensive deficiencies, and New York flames out before the postseason begins.\nX factor: Attitude. Chris Kreider has talked about it. There's a certain chip on the Rangers' shoulder after the way their previous two seasons have gone, with one ending in the Eastern Conference finals and the other in a first-round exit versus New Jersey. Can't New York actually use that pain to its advantage now? It's one thing to talk about being frustrated; it's another to see the changes made in the wake of failure and not do something about it on the ice, where it actually counts. The Rangers have a chance to rally around their prior disappointment. Would that actually have an effect on their outcome this season? Stranger things have happened. But talk alone is cheap.\n\nFantasy outlook: The defense remains strong for fantasy, with Adam Fox challenging for best overall among defenders, Jacob Trouba remaining a source for counting stats and K'Andre Miller finding value.\nBold prediction: Kaapo Kakko takes flight and lives up to his draft pedigree.\nLast season: 65-12-5, 135 points. Lost in the first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1800\nKey players added: F Milan Lucic, F James van Riemsdyk, D Kevin Shattenkirk\nKey players lost: F Patrice Bergeron, F Tyler Bertuzzi, F Nick Foligno, F Taylor Hall, F David Krejci, D Connor Clifton, D Dmitry Orlov\nMost fascinating player: Brad Marchand. The newly minted Bruins captain has been one of the team's most consistent contributors for over a decade, and now he's taking on a leadership mantle vacated by franchise legend Patrice Bergeron. Will that added responsibility alter how the feisty Marchand conducts himself on the ice? Or will it inspire even better play out of the 35-year-old, who impressively has maintained a near point-per-game output throughout his career to date?\nBest case: Boston endured a devastatingly poor finish in the playoffs last season that frankly overshadowed its wildly successful, historically dominant regular season. In a perfect world that disappointment fuels the Bruins' fire to not only be an Atlantic Division contender but pushes them through a long postseason run from there. That might not include the precursor of another Presidents' Trophy bid, especially given all the players Boston has lost since last season ended. It might actually be better for the Bruins to build their way up slowly, getting to construct a new identity under second-year coach Jim Montgomery and rallying around their impressive core helmed by Linus Ullmark, Charlie McAvoy, David Pastrnak, Marchand and more. There's a great deal of talent in the Bruins' ranks; best-case scenario is they make the most of it.\nWorst case: It's not easy replacing the number of key players Boston had to let walk out the door. GM Don Sweeney was hamstrung by a lack of cap space and that (partially) led to Orlov, Clifton, Hall and Bertuzzi exiting the organization. Bergeron and Krejci have retired. There are clear holes Boston must fill in the lineup, and the players Sweeney did add are all veterans in the later stages of their careers who can best be expected to contribute in depth roles. That might not be a recipe for success in the increasingly competitive Atlantic, where teams like Buffalo, Ottawa and Detroit will be right in the mix for a playoff spot when they weren't before. The Bruins could fall behind early in that race and never recover, finally fulfilling the yearly prophecy from outside voices that they are, in fact, no longer able to keep pace with the up-and-comers around them.\nX factor: Charlie McAvoy (and the Bruins' defense). It still feels like McAvoy doesn't earn enough attention for how good he is patrolling Boston's back end. This season will require the most out of all the Bruins' best players, but eyes will be on the likes of McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm (another under-the-radar defender) to help stabilize Boston early on when there could be some growing pains with the skaters being introduced up front. The Bruins lost some physicality with Clifton going to the Sabres, and the now-departed Orlov was a superb pickup for them at the trade deadline last spring. Now it's on Boston's incumbents to pick up the slack, helping the Bruins keep from (possibly) missing a beat.\n\nFantasy outlook: Replacing the total lost offensive talent of Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci won't be simple, as Charlie Coyle and James van Riemsdyk are next up for the scoring lines. Brad Marchand might not rebound from his 129th overall showing last season, but Charlie McAvoy might improve on his 92nd-place finish.\nBold prediction: Contrary to popular prediction, the Bruins make the playoffs.\nLast season: 46-30-6, 98 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +2200\nKey players added: F Luke Glendening, F Tyler Motte, F Conor Sheary\nKey players lost: F Corey Perry, F Alex Killorn, F Pat Maroon, F Ross Colton\nMost fascinating player: Victor Hedman. Tampa Bay is going to need everything out of Hedman now that Andrei Vasilevskiy is going to miss significant time with an injury. Hedman has been the Lightning's backbone on the blue line (and elsewhere) for essentially his entire career. But the pressure on Hedman to be Tampa Bay's top blueliner will only be amplified now with Vasilevskiy out. Hedman is 32. He's battled injuries, and the 24-plus minutes per game the veteran is averaging don't come without significant wear and tear on a nightly basis. Still, who can count out a talent like Hedman? The way he supports the Lightning at 5-on-5 and both special teams units is nothing short of impressive. What can he offer the Lightning now -- when they're a little more down and out?\nBest case: Tampa Bay set the bar high with two Stanley Cup wins and a Cup Final appearance since 2020. Given the loss of Vasilevskiy in net and the void left by Alex Killorn departing in free agency, the best case for Tampa would be seeing its depth start to shine long before the playoffs. Brandon Hagel and Tanner Jeannot explode in top-six or top-nine roles that take some pressure off the Lightning back end and allow the team time to establish a strong identity amid some changes (particularly up front). By the time Vasilevskiy is able to come back, the Lightning are still on the playoff bubble and ready to challenge for an Eastern Conference slot.\nWorst case: Tampa Bay can't overcome the early roadblocks in its way, and that ultimately decides where the Lightning end up -- outside the playoffs for the first time since Jon Cooper took over as the club's full-time head coach. Distractions abound with Vasilevskiy's injury and Steven Stamkos' contentious contract extension talks. And then there's the state of Tampa Bay's defense if Hedman can't be their usual workhorse. Will Mikhail Sergachev be able to fill in and carry a heavier load? Has Tampa Bay lost too many of its veteran voices in Killorn and Maroon especially that it can't fight through the inevitable rough patches ahead? This could be the year we see the Lightning window truly begin to close.\nX factor: Nikita Kucherov. Any success the Lightning have offensively is bound to be driven by Kucherov. He is still one of the league's most dynamic, dominant forwards (Kucherov just pocketed 113 points in 82 games last season) and can do a great deal to buoy any lagging confidence his team has in itself with some singularly stellar individual performances. It's rare that one player can genuinely be a difference-maker night after night, particularly when Atlantic rosters around the Lightning have been beefed up over the last few months, but Kucherov has the firepower to flip every switch on for Tampa Bay. They might need that more than ever this year.\n\nFantasy outlook: Mikhail Sergachev will be pushing Hedman for a larger share of the pie again, and he earned it last season, beating Hedman for overall value.\nBold prediction: The Lightning miss the playoffs.\nLast season: 47-25-10, 104 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +2000\nKey players added: F Pierre-Luc Dubois, D Vladislav Gavrikov, F Trevor Lewis, G David Rittich, G Cam Talbot\nKey players lost: D Sean Durzi, D Alexander Edler, F Alex Iafallo, G Joonas Korpisalo, F Rasmus Kupari, F Gabriel Vilardi\nMost fascinating player: Dubois. Another offseason. Another move by the Kings to signal that they are trying to win now. Kings GM Rob Blake was willing to part with quite a bit to trade for Dubois and then sign him to an eight-year contract worth $8.5 million annually. Getting Dubois accomplished a few items for the Kings. The first is that it places them in the discussion for one of the strongest center situations in the NHL in Phillip Danault, Anze Kopitar and Dubois anchoring their top three lines. Another element that comes with getting Dubois is that the Kings now have another top-six forward who they believe can help them now and in the future contend for what they feel has a chance to be a lengthy championship window.\nBest case: Slaying the dragon that is the first round. Practically every conversation around the Kings seeking to win a third Stanley Cup at some point comes back to the fact that getting beyond the first round has been an issue. Their two most recent postseason campaigns saw them get eliminated by the Oilers in the first round -- a place they have failed to escape since the 2013-14 season when they won their second Cup in three years. Advancing beyond the first round would not only see the Kings clear a near-decade long hurdle, but it would also see them gain a firmer grasp of a challenging Western Conference landscape.\nWorst case: It really would be losing in the first round for a third straight season. Part of it stems from the fact they have been aggressive over the last few seasons by going after players such as Viktor Arvidsson, Kevin Fiala, Vladislav Gavrikov, Danualt and Dubois. Another element is the fact that the Kings are about to face some considerable salary cap decisions when the next offseason arrives. Arvidsson along with all three goalies in Pheonix Copley, David Rittich and Cam Talbot are members of a five-player UFA class. Prospects such as Quinton Byfield, Blake Lizotte and Arthur Kaliyev are part of a five-player RFA class in need of new contracts for a team that CapFriendly projects will have $23.3 million in available cap space to address their roster needs.\nX factor: The dynamic with their goaltenders. Finding what they believed to be their strongest tandem became a season-long narrative for the Kings. They were hindered by a disconnect between a defensive structure that was top 10 in fewest shots allowed per 60, fewest scoring chances allowed per 60, fewest high-danger scoring chances per 60 and what proved to be porous goaltending. They used the deadline to address those concerns and were active again in the offseason by signing Rittich and Talbot. Having those two along with Copley gives three experienced options that only costs them $3.375 million in cap space for a team that's trying to find consistency in net.\n\nFantasy outlook: Those interested in a sleeper asset up front might give Quinton Byfield a long look. After two part-time seasons with the Kings, the 21-year-old is expected to kick it up a notch, enjoying a regular shot to compete within this club's impressive top six.\nBold prediction: Talbot proves to be the answer in goal.\nLast season: 46-25-11, 103 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +3500\nKey players added: F Patrick Maroon\nKey players lost: D Matt Dumba, D John Klingberg, F Gustav Nyquist, F Oskar Sundqvist, F Sam Steel\nMost fascinating player: Filip Gustavsson. Going from being the No. 3 goaltender in Ottawa to operating in tandem with a presumed future Hall of Fame inductee in Marc-Andre Fleury is the most succinct way to describe Gustavsson's arc. He would ultimately overtake Fleury, which was the case in the playoffs when he won twice in his five playoff appearances before the Wild were ultimately eliminated in the first round. Gustavsson then signed a three-year extension to give the Wild an option in net for the future with the 38-year-old Fleury in the final year of his deal while Jesper Wallstedt, their first-round pick from 2021, continues his development in the AHL.\nBest case: Reaching the playoffs for a fifth straight season would be a start. So would the idea of winning an opening-round series for the first time since the 2014-15 season. Getting beyond that familiar hurdle could be hypothetically accomplished if the Wild can find a way to create the offensive consistency that eluded them throughout the majority of last season. It was evident in that first-round series against the Stars that also saw the Wild finish the playoffs with the fewest shots per 60 and third-fewest goals per 60 in 5-on-5 play, according to Natural Stat Trick.\nWorst case: If they miss the playoffs or have a fifth straight first-round exit because of a lack of offense. One of the largest challenges the Wild faced in trying to address their offensive issues was a lack of cap space given the combined Zach Parise and Ryan Suter buyouts will cost them $14.7 million in 2023-24 and again in 2024-25. It's what further amplifies the need for the Wild to find even more production from a roster that went through more subtractions in the offseason than it did with Patrick Maroon being their lone addition.\nX factor: What sort of impact could Brock Faber and Marco Rossi have on a team in need of contributions from players on cheap deals? Faber provided insight into how he could help the Wild after he signed his ELC following the completion of the Golden Gophers' season that ended with a national title game defeat. He averaged 20 minutes in two regular-season games before logging more than 14 minutes in six playoff games. Rossi recorded one point -- an assist -- in 19 games with the Wild before going to the AHL where he scored 16 goals and averaged 0.96 points in 53 games. Given the offseason departures and the need to find contributors to fill those needs, it appears Faber and Rossi both have a chance to make a significant impact for the Wild.\n\nFantasy outlook: Young blueliner Calen Addison operates as an off-radar asset in fantasy competition that favors power-play points. The now 23-year-old led the Wild's blue line with 18 power-play points, and it wasn't even close, in just 62 games last year -- his first full NHL campaign.\nBold prediction: Bill Guerin becomes a sneaky seller.\nLast season: 40-31-11, 91 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +2500\nKey players added: F Noel Acciari, F Lars Eller, F Reilly Smith, D Ryan Graves, D Erik Karlsson\nKey players lost: F Jason Zucker, D Brian Dumoulin, D Jeff Petry, G Casey DeSmith\nMost fascinating player: Erik Karlsson. Is there any question who everyone will be watching when Pittsburgh takes the ice for opening night? Karlsson is in the middle of a career renaissance, and he's linking up with some of the NHL's most storied players of the past decade in Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang. What will Karlsson bring to the group? He's capable of taking on any role at 5-on-5 and on special teams, plus he's got the hunger to finally chase down an elusive Stanley Cup championship. Karlsson ended up in a place with recent playoff pedigree, but the Penguins need Karlsson to be on top of his game (again) to get there. Can he prove the 2023 Norris Trophy win was no fluke with another jaw-dropping season?\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nBest case: Pittsburgh is determined to avoid another embarrassing non-playoff finish and overcompensates entirely with a standout season from start to finish. Karlsson transitions without issue into a prominent role on the blue line, while Crosby and Malkin turn back the clock with vintage performances of their own. Tristan Jarry stands tall as the team's No. 1 netminder, and coach Mike Sullivan gets the most out of the Penguins' depth both up front and on the blue line. Pittsburgh works its way back to the postseason and goes on a surprisingly long run fueled by its veteran leaders.\nWorst case: Time catches up with everyone, and every team, eventually. That happens now to Pittsburgh. Instead of slowly sliding out of playoff contention, the Penguins are never even in the hunt as it's clear from the outset they can't keep up with the Eastern Conference's fast-paced risers. Jarry shows he can't carry the load in goal and frustration sets in for Crosby & Co. watching the team struggle its way through another season. GM Kyle Dubas starts exploring trade options early, and by mid-February is already offloading players in an effort to set Pittsburgh up for something better in the future.\nX factor: Tristan Jarry. Dubas took a chance on Jarry when he re-signed Pittsburgh's incumbent to a five-year, $26.8 million deal in July. It wasn't that Jarry was awful in 2022-23 (he produced a .909 SV% and 2.90 GAA) but it was his lack of timely saves and big performances at the right moments which drew criticism (not to mention he has been through spells of injury problems). To reward the 28-year-old with a lucrative, long-term deal adds plenty of pressure on Jarry going into a pivotal season for the Penguins. Will that ultimately affect his mindset? Or will Jarry thrive now that he knows the organization is behind him? It's a fine line to walk with goaltenders. Pittsburgh should find out quickly whether Dubas was right to bet on Jarry again.\n\nFantasy outlook: Jake Guentzel's injury to start the season opens a small window for Reilly Smith to gain some footing in the top six after coming over from the Golden Knights.\nBold prediction: Erik Karlsson plays a \"complete\" style.\nLast season: 46-28-8, 100 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +4000\nKey players added: F Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, D Brian Dumoulin, F Kailer Yamamoto\nKey players lost: F Ryan Donato, F Joonas Donskoi, F Morgan Geekie, G Martin Jones, D Carson Soucy, F Daniel Sprong\nMost fascinating player: Philipp Grubauer. What allows Grubauer to be in this position is what he showed in the playoffs compared to the postseason. Since Grubauer signed that six-year contract worth $5.9 million in free agency, injuries and inconsistencies have led to him fielding a 3.01 GAA and a 0.892 save percentage. Yet what he accomplished in the playoffs beyond his 2.99 GAA and a .903 save percentage he posted is what creates intrigue. He was one of the main reasons why the Kraken upset the then-reigning Cup champion Avalanche in the first round and were a game away from the Western Conference final before losing to the Stars.\nBest case: Returning to at least the second round of the playoffs. Going from a lottery team in their first year of existence to a game away from the conference final the following season is proof that much can change in a year. Showing they are a consistent playoff team that can win at least one round appears to be the goal for the Kraken at a time in which the most recent Cup champions in the Avs and Golden Knights shows the path for a title -- as of this moment -- appears to be running through the Western Conference.\nWorst case: Any sort of regression. Wide-ranging as that might be, it's something to consider when it comes to what the Kraken could achieve in Year 3. What does Calder Trophy winner and NHL All-Star Game selection Matty Beniers do for a follow up act? How does Vince Dunn build upon a career year that saw him earn a long-term contract while further proving he could handle the demands of being a top-pairing defenseman? Does the scoring depth the Kraken used throughout the regular season and playoffs continue or will the production be harder to generate?\nX factor: How much of an impact can Chris Driedger have? Driedger missed the entire 2022-23 season recovering from a knee injury he sustained at the IIHF Men's World Championships in 2022. His injury led to the Kraken signing Martin Jones, who won a team-high 27 games before Grubauer was their full-time starter in the playoffs. Jones left in free agency, which means the Kraken will turn to either Driedger, who will start the season in the AHL, or Joey Daccord as the backup.\n\nFantasy outlook: Top center Matty Beniers appears on the upswing after bursting forth with 24 goals and 33 helpers in his rookie season. The reigning Calder winner projects to eclipse 65 points in his sophomore campaign.\nBold prediction: The Kraken take a step back, miss the playoffs.\nLast season: 42-33-7, 91 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +4000\nKey players added: D Connor Clifton, D Erik Johnson\nKey players lost: G Craig Anderson\nMost fascinating player: Rasmus Dahlin. Here's a 23-year-old defenseman entering a contract year after a breakout season where he tallied 73 points in 78 games and rightly earned Norris Trophy buzz throughout. Dahlin carries himself with veteran swagger and truly seems invested in sticking with the Sabres long-term because of their potential to finally turn the corner and become a perennial contender. Buffalo saw last season how, when its defensive details faltered, so did its success in the win column. Dahlin seems poised to fix that this year, and elevate not only the Sabres' back end but his own stock as a Norris contender again. Is that too much pressure for someone Dahlin's age (and with the added expectations of negotiating a new deal)? Time will tell.\nBest case: Buffalo makes the playoffs. That's it. There is nothing (on paper) holding the Sabres back from ending the 12-year postseason drought looming over their organization like an unmovable black cloud. Buffalo has the young talents (see: Dahlin, Tage Thompson, Dylan Cozens, Mattias Samuelsson, etc) and veteran presences (i.e. Kyle Okposo, Jeff Skinner, and Alex Tuch) to produce a complementary mix up front and on the blue line. There's significant buy-in from Buffalo's players to the identity and culture they've been cultivating under GM Kevyn Adams and head coach Don Granato. This is when the Sabres have to make good on their potential and show why a slow-and-steady rebuild was the correct path to their eventual sustained success.\nWorst case: The Sabres fall short, again. Their playoff dry spell hits 13 seasons and it shakes the core foundation of what the franchise thought it was creating through the last several years of patience with its process. While players have outwardly stated they're ready to take on those additional expectations (both internal and external), it's easier said than done -- particularly when a club runs up against inevitable tough stretches and injury issues. If Buffalo can't weather the storms better than it has in the past -- think of how that stretch of winning one game out of nine in March derailed its postseason hopes last year -- then the Sabres find themselves sitting in disappointment once more as the clock keeps running on their time to step up and make some noise.\nX factor: Goaltending. The Sabres are counting on youngsters like Devon Levi (age: 21) and Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen (24) to take the reigns from previous incumbents like Anderson (who had a late-career surge in Buffalo over the last couple years). Granato has said he wouldn't bet against Levi being able to take over the Sabres' starting job and Levi did produce a .905 SV% and 2.94 GAA in seven NHL appearances during the 2022-23 season. But will Levi and Luukkonen combine to be a strong enough tandem to carry Buffalo where it wants to go? Or will netminding ultimately doom the Sabres to a lesser outcome in the standings than they're aiming towards? For a team desperately trying to get its foot in the door, the margin for error at any position is slim.\n\nFantasy outlook: By not going another route in the offseason, the Sabres have indicated a willingness to let Levi take the ball and run with it as the starter. Given the talent up front, there's a ton of potential value packed in Levi as a fantasy pick.\nBold prediction: The internet discovers JJ Peterka.\nLast season: 42-31-9, 93 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +5000\nKey players added: None\nKey players lost: F Josh Bailey\nMost fascinating player: Mathew Barzal. What can we make of Barzal's contributions up until now for the Islanders? He's consistently producing more assists than goals and averages a decent point total year over year, but where is Barzal's impact truly felt? Is he the game-changing forward stats (on their face) might suggest? And if so, why haven't the Islanders had more success since he's been in the fold? There's no question Barzal is a top-end puck mover, but is he driving play enough? Is there more to be expected from him? There's intrigue around him going into this year given how little GM Lou Lamoriello did to upgrade the Islanders beyond re-signing some of their own players. If Barzal could have a breakout season of sorts where he's scoring timely goals and being a greater playmaker? That's big.\nBest case: The Islanders' commitment to their own pays off. Ilya Sorokin -- fresh from signing an eight-year extension -- puts on a Vezina Trophy-worthy show to guide New York into the postseason, where they battle through a couple rounds. Bo Horvat showcases more than just a flash or two of his best self and drives the Islanders' offense in the way his capabilities have proven, in the past, that he can. The Islanders see sustained growth from some of their young studs -- including Oliver Wahlstrom and Noah Dobson -- and the momentum gives the organization hope for a bright future beyond just this coming season.\nWorst case: New York's season is as stagnant as its offseason signings. The team sputters immediately and even Sorokin's brilliance can't make up for a lack of offense and general star power at either end of the ice. Horvat wilts under the pressure to step up and Barzal doesn't evolve enough to help the team change course. Coach Lane Lambert loses the room, and New York falls into the mushy middle where it remains until the regular season ends -- without a postseason bid.\nX factor: Special teams. New York iced the third-worst power play in the NHL last season, lowest by far of any team that went to the playoffs. Even Dobson has admitted the Islanders \"lost their confidence\" there as things continued to spiral out of control (losing Barzal to injury certainly didn't boost New York's prospects there, either). It's hard to keep pace with the league's best teams when you can't put pucks in with the man advantage. The Islanders must see improvements there in order to be a competitive team -- not just in the regular season but if the playoffs are in their future, as well. The Islanders can't be in their own heads again and let power play chances be a hindrance instead of a help.\n\nFantasy outlook: A healthy Barzal hasn't had a heck of a lot of time to gel with Horvat, so the hope is that the latter can prop up Barzal's stagnated value in recent seasons. If they stick together, there will be a golden opportunity on the other wing for someone -- and Wahlstrom has the inside track.\nBold prediction: Barzal grows his hair back.\nLast season: 38-27-17, 93 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +3500\nKey players added: F Yegor Sharangovich\nKey players lost: F Trevor Lewis, F Milan Lucic, D Michael Stone, F Tyler Toffoli\nMost fascinating player: Elias Lindholm. Does he stay? Does he go? What does a future with him in Calgary look like? What does a future without him in Calgary look like? Lindholm, who is part of an eight-player UFA class, is expected to give the Flames a decision regarding his future at some point. Should he opt to stay, the Flames would be retaining one of their most important forwards considering Lindholm was second on the team in points and can log significant ice time on both special teams units. Yet if he chooses to depart, it would leave the Flames once again searching for a way to fill the void left by another key member of their lineup.\nBest case: Getting into the playoffs and winning a first-round series allows those players who are still undecided about staying the green light to continue with the Flames. Part of what makes the Flames' current situation so cumbersome is that for the players who could be elsewhere, they have the same amount of players who are under contract for at least two more seasons which represents a long-term plan. It's possible that a strong regular season coupled with a postseason run could serve as a potential retainment tool as the Flames look to create even more roster continuity.\nWorst case: Missing the playoffs while failing to capitalize on the opportunity to trade any one of those pending UFAs for draft capital could be the answer. Even for all the challenges they faced last season, the Flames were still two points away from being in the final wild-card spot and qualifying for the playoffs for a consecutive season. Couple that with the fact they have a few decisions to make regarding a number of their UFAs and it reinforces how the 2023-24 season has a chance to be a pivotal one for the Flames' current and future plans.\nX factor: Was last April a stepping stone for Jacob Markstrom? Finding consistency proved to be a season-long issue for Markstrom, who finished with a 2.92 goals-against average and a .892 save percentage. Those were the lowest marks he's recorded since establishing himself as a full-time goalie in the 2015-16 season. Something that could create optimism regarding what he could achieve in 2023-24 is how he performed in April. Despite going 1-1-2, Markstrom had a 2.47 GAA and a .915 save percentage in five appearances. Even though it was not the largest sample size, it was still the highest save percentage and second-highest GAA that Markstrom recorded in any month.\n\nFantasy outlook: Get ready for Jonathan Huberdeau to rebound after hemorrhaging 70 points from the previous season in Florida. No, he won't collect 115 again, but 75-80 feels well within reach, skating on a line with top center Lindholm.\nBold prediction: Andrew Mangiapane has a monster rebound year.\nLast season: 39-35-8, 86 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +5000\nKey players added: F Vladimir Tarasenko, G Joonas Korpisalo\nKey players lost: F Alex DeBrincat, G Cam Talbot\nMost fascinating player: Korpisalo. Ottawa has been waiting on a No. 1 stud to take over the net. GM Pierre Dorion tried to fill in that gap with Cam Talbot and the veteran failed to deliver. Now he's got Korpisalo stepping into his first true starting job. Will he be the savior these Senators have been longing for, one of the missing pieces in Ottawa's long journey back to being a playoff-caliber team? Korpisalo was primarily a backup in Columbus and through his brief stint with the Kings post-trade deadline last spring. Yet his numbers (.904 SV%, 3.01 GAA) are relatively strong. Can Korpisalo -- in tandem with Anton Forsberg -- elevate Ottawa in an area they've been perennially struggling with? That could be a difference-maker in their outcomes this season.\nBest case: Ottawa makes the playoffs. It's been a long time coming. There's been enough talk about how the Senators structured their rebuild, how they drafted and developed talent (starting with Tim Stutzle, Brady Tkachuk and Thomas Chabot, among others), how they've been patient in attacking roster construction. All of the things. It's about time Ottawa saw the fruits of its labors. A healthy Josh Norris -- who missed almost all of last season with injury -- and Artem Zub will have a major impact on Ottawa upfront and across the blue line. Dorion went about addressing the Senators' goaltending in the offseason and with the team's sale done and approved, there are no distractions. This is Ottawa's moment.\nWorst case: Well, Ottawa doesn't make the playoffs. Whether due to injuries stacking up (again), or just an inability to build chemistry and reach its potential. Doesn't matter why, really. If the Senators aren't at least in the postseason race to the end then it will be hard for Dorion to not just keep his own job, but stick behind coach DJ Smith another season on top of it. The Senators and their fans have been waiting a long time to reach this sort of pinnacle. Letting another season go by without anything to show for it by way of a postseason bid would simply not be good enough for anyone inside or outside the organization.\nX factor: Jakob Chychrun. When the long-time Arizona defender finally moved on elsewhere it was to an Ottawa team that fully embraced having a blueliner of his ability on their side. The Senators just want to see Chychrun at his best -- and they're still waiting. After being traded to Canada's capital city, Chychrun played in just 12 games before missing the rest of the year with an injury. The five points he produced in that span was significantly less than the sort of impact Ottawa is rightly expecting from him. The Senators can't be the contenders they want -- and need -- to be without Chychrun playing like he's capable of (see: 41 points in 56 games in 2020-21). Will he get back there? That's the question.\n\nFantasy outlook: The defense is deep, with Chabot still likely at the top of the pyramid, but ebbs and flows where Chychrun and Jake Sanderson take turns as No. 1 are likely.\nBold prediction: The Senators make the playoffs.\nLast season: 46-33-3, 95 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +5000\nKey players added: G Laurent Brossoit, F Alex Iafallo, F Rasmus Kupari, F Gabriel Vilardi\nKey players lost: F Pierre-Luc Dubois, G David Rittich, F Blake Wheeler\nMost fascinating player: Connor Hellebuyck. He's a perennial Vezina Trophy candidate who's become the sort of nightly fixture that can be trusted to start more than 60 games a season. His performances can oftentimes be the difference between reaching the playoffs or missing out on them entirely. What Hellebuyck has accomplished has made him one of, if not the, most crucial player the Jets have in their annual bid to reach the postseason. And similar to a number of his teammates, Hellebuyck is in the final year of his contract.\nBest case: In terms of the regular season? Getting to the playoffs and advancing beyond the first round for the first time since the 2020-21 season would be one answer. In terms of their roster? That onto itself is a more complex discussion. Trading Pierre-Luc Dubois while placing former captain Blake Wheeler on waivers were the first major changes for a roster that could be significantly altered over the coming months. Assessing what happens next when it comes to the six players in the last years of their contract is a dilemma that is seeking a resolution.\nWorst case: In terms of the regular season? Missing the playoffs or reaching the playoffs only to be eliminated in the first round is also an answer. As for their roster? It's plausible the answer could hinge upon what happens with their six-player pending UFA class. Brenden Dillon, Nino Niederreiter, Mark Scheifele and Hellebuyck are part of that group entering the final years of their contracts for a team that has decisions to make. Receiving the sort of return that can either help them now which was the case in the Dubois trade or aid them later would plausibly soften the blow of the Jets losing those players. Watching them leave without receiving anything in return beyond freeing up cap space, however, could prove problematic given the Jets only have 20 out of a possible 21 draft picks over the next three cycles.\nX factor: A healthy Cole Perfetti would hypothetically give the Jets another option now that they are trying to recoup the production they lost by moving on from Dubois and Wheeler. Ever since they drafted Perfetti in the first round in 2020, the Jets haven't been able to receive the firmest grasp when it comes to what Perfetti can provide. Injuries limited him to seven points in 18 games during the 2021-22 season while the 2022-23 saw him score eight goals and have 30 points in 51 games before he was moved to injured reserve in February.\n\nFantasy outlook: With Pierre-Luc Dubois and Blake Wheeler sent packing, youngsters Perfetti and Gabriel Vilardi have ripe opportunities to carve out permanent roles within the Jets' top six. As second-line center in the case of Perfetti, and somewhere on the wing for Vilardi.\nBold prediction: Hellebuyck re-signs in Winnipeg.\nLast season: 35-37-10, 80 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Alex DeBrincat, F J.T. Compher, F Klim Kostin, F Daniel Sprong, D Shayne Gostisbehere, D Jeff Petry, G James Reimer\nKey players lost: F Dominik Kubalik, F Filip Zadina, G Alex Nedeljkovic\nMost fascinating player: DeBrincat. How do you not wonder about what DeBrincat will do for Detroit's offense? The Red Wings haven't produced a 40-goal scorer since Marian Hossa hit the mark in 2008-09. That was in Detroit's heyday of 25 consecutive playoff appearances. Can DeBrincat help ignite the Red Wings' up front and recapture some of that former glory? It was just two years ago in Chicago that the 24-year-old winger topped out at 41 goals, and he'll be surrounded by greater talents even in Detroit than he had with Blackhawks (no disrespect to Patrick Kane, of course). DeBrincat wanted a fresh start after his lone season in Ottawa last year, and going home to the Detroit area seems like a perfect match between player and team.\nBest case: Detroit's been biding its time getting back into contender mode. GM Steve Yzerman looks to have his proverbial ducks in a row now for the Red Wings to be back in that space. Yzerman's club hasn't reached playoffs since 2016 and the aggressive nature of Detroit's last two offseasons -- adding top-tier young skaters like DeBrincat, rising studs like Ville Husso and veteran voices with David Perron -- has all pointed them in a strong direction. Best case scenario now is that it includes a postseason berth. Patience is a virtue, but it's also got to yield results, too. The Red Wings haven't shied away from recognizing their flaws and addressing them, like swapping out Nedeljkovic for a seasoned veteran in Reimer to play behind Husso. Detroit looks ready to announce itself onto the postseason stage again.\nWorst case: Yzerman wasn't making moves to improve Detroit at the trade deadline last spring. He -- and the team -- knew they wouldn't get over the hump and be a playoff club by April. History repeating itself for an eighth straight year in 2023-24 could spell a disaster of sorts. Detroit can't have lesser expectations than playoffs given how stacked its roster is at nearly every position compared to where it's been in years past. Even if injuries pile up there's ample depth in the Red Wings' ranks, too, which should keep them from stumbling too hard. Detroit failing to reach its own potential in the coming season could leave ownership no choice but to make changes internally, something that might lead to unnecessary (not to mention destabilizing) turmoil for the team.\nX factor: Derek Lalonde. Yzerman inserted the former Tampa Bay Lightning assistant into Detroit's head-coaching job ahead of last season, and that was a clear learning experience for Lalonde. How can he be better now behind the bench and help these Red Wings rise? Detroit's special teams improved slightly last season over the previous campaign, and there were improvements made on the defensive side as well. But for Detroit to overtake some of the other Eastern Conference power players and work its way into the playoff picture, its coach has to be pushing the right buttons. Can Lalonde maximize the Red Wings roster and get the most out of their top talents in particular?\n\nFantasy outlook: With an upgraded defense, Husso is a candidate to rebound from a disappointing debut after the Red Wings invested in him last offseason.\nBold prediction: Lucas Raymond has his breakout.\nLast season: 42-32-8, 92 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Gustav Nyquist, F Ryan O'Reilly, D Luke Schenn\nKey players lost: F Matt Duchene, F Ryan Johansen\nMost fascinating player: O'Reilly. Never mind the fact he's considered to be one of the game's premier two-way centers. The case can be made that O'Reilly and his decision to sign a four-year contract with the Predators represents something. Exactly what it represents is the mystery and that's the point. Back in March, the Predators used the trade deadline to hit a reset button of sorts which allowed David Poile to set the stage for his heir, Barry Trotz, to take over as the club's GM. Trotz kept it going by trading Johansen and placing Matt Duchene on waivers. Only to then place the Preds in a position to have one of the more surprising hauls by signing three veterans led by O'Reilly which has led to questions about if the Preds could plausibly be in contention for the playoffs after last's absence snapped an eight-year postseason streak.\nBest case: New Predators coach Andrew Brunette's prolific philosophies provide the roster with the sort of goals that eluded them last season. And if that happens? It's possible that Brunette's tactics could lead to the Predators returning to the postseason. Even with the trades they made at the deadline plus Johansen being out since February, the Predators still finished three points shy of the final wild-card spot. Brunette's time as the interim coach of the Panthers, along with his lone year as a Devils assistant, saw both teams finish among the top 10 in the league in a number of offensive categories. Getting those sorts of results for a team that missed the playoffs by three points while having a minus-9 goal differential could prove crucial in Brunette's first year behind the bench.\nWorst case: Does one really exist? Let's say the Predators miss the playoffs. It's a consecutive campaign without the postseason for a team that was already considered by some to be a bit of a guessing game when it came to the playoffs. If that happens, then, the Predators can continue to stockpile more draft capital and/or prospects considering they have nine pending UFAs led by Tyson Barrie who could be moved at or ahead of the trade deadline. So what happens if they do make the playoffs? Then the question becomes: Can the Preds make it out of the first round for the first time since the 2017-18 season?\nX factor: How much support will Juuse Saros receive this season? No goaltender played more games, logged more minutes, faced more shots and made more saves than Saros during the 2022-23 season. What he's accomplished since taking over as the team's full-time starter is give the Predators a goaltender who is capable of starting more than 60 times in a season at a time in which more teams are shifting to tandems. Providing Saros with more support either in the form of facing fewer shots or scoring more goals could lessen the burden carried by one of the NHL's premier goaltenders.\n\nFantasy outlook: Second-line winger Tommy Novak is looking to replicate, if not better, last season's unanticipated haul of 43 points in 51 games. There's no reason to believe Novak can't again flirt with a similar pace, but this time through a full run in the NHL.\nBold prediction: The Predators make the playoffs.\nLast season: 35-37-10, 80 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Max Pacioretty, D Joel Edmundson\nKey players lost: F Conor Sheary\nMost fascinating player: Alex Ovechkin. Who isn't enthralled by Ovechkin and his continued milestone chase? How often is there a player in the league within legitimate striking distance of setting new benchmarks and re-writing history books on a nightly basis? It's impossible not to get caught up in that, whether you're rooting for Ovechkin to usurp Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's top all-time goal scorer or not. Washington didn't have much else to be optimistic about last year beyond Ovechkin pumping in goals to get him closer to Gretzky's mark. There's little doubt Ovechkin's continued prowess will draw everyone in again, regardless of how the Capitals are doing around him.\nBest case: Washington GM Brian MacLellan made the right call trading players away at the deadline last season and letting the Capitals slide out of the playoff field. The changes made since then all combine now to boost Washington back into contending status. First-year head coach Spencer Carbery hits the ground running with a strong first month of the season to set Washington up well. Nicklas Backstrom, John Carlson and Tom Wilson -- who all missed significant time with injuries last season -- are stronger than ever and remain healthy for a full 82-game season. Pacioretty is back on the ice too and supports the Capitals' offense enough to see them back into the postseason. And of course, Ovechkin gets closer to his next milestone.\nWorst case: Washington gets off the ground but never takes flight. Its top talents have lost a step against the league's tougher competition, and Carbery can't find the right combinations up front to steer Washington out of its skid. Evgeny Kuznetsov remains disgruntled with his place in the organization and that seeps into his diminished play on the ice. The Capitals can't gain any momentum and it's obvious they're done before their calendar flips to 2024.\nX factor: It's all about the veterans -- namely Backstrom, T.J. Oshie and Kuznetsov. What more do they have to give the Capitals now? Backstrom has put his body through a recent hip resurfacing. Oshie missed the end of last season with injury and underwent a double ablation surgery in the offseason. And Kuznetsov admitted to a lingering back issue that hindered him most of last season. Plus, there's Pacioretty's condition coming off two torn Achilles. If those types of problems crop up again, how will the Capitals cope? Is there enough depth to patch the holes? Washington is in a precarious position as it is with the number of 30-somethings it leans on every night. Last season showed how fast the wheels fall off without some of those key players. Is Washington doomed to face a similar fate this season?\n\nFantasy outlook: If things go well, Darcy Kuemper would be a fantasy boon, but his fortune will ride with the overall fortunes of his teammates.\nBold prediction: Ovechkin will score his 850th career goal Jan. 18, 2024.\nLast season: 38-37-7, 83 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Teddy Blueger, D Ian Cole, D Carson Soucy, F Pius Suter\nKey players lost: G Collin Delia, D Oliver Ekman-Larsson\nMost fascinating player: Filip Hronek. There's no shortage of candidates, yet what might give Hronek the edge is all the moving pieces involved with his situation. It starts with the fact that the Canucks parted with two picks -- namely the first-rounder they received in the Bo Horvat trade to get Hronek. Then there's the fact he sustained a season-ending shoulder injury that limited his time with the Canucks to four games. Finally, a healthy Hronek proved to be the first move in the Canucks' attempt to revamp their defense beyond Quinn Hughes. Since getting Hronek in a trade, the Canucks used the offseason to sign Cole and Soucy with the aim those collective arrives can help a defensive unit that fielded the NHL's worst penalty kill with a 71.6% success rate in addition to being seventh in goals allowed per 60 in 5-on-5 play.\nBest case: Any of the progress Rick Tocchet made can manifest itself over an entire season that could see them in the wild-card hunt. It starts with the notion the Canucks won 20 of their 36 games with Tocchet on the bench. That was the 12th most victories in the NHL during that time. Even though the Canucks are still in cap limbo, they addressed their needs by getting a pair of two-way forwards such as Blueger and Suter in addition to defensemen such as Cole and Soucy. If the Canucks can harness what they did under Tocchet, show signs of defensive improvement all while remaining above league average in goals scored? It's possible they could be among the teams pushing for a playoff spot.\nWorst case: None of the progress Tocchet made manifests itself over an entire season which would bring the franchise back to where they were when they fired Bruce Boudreau and hired Tocchet in the first place. Last offseason, there was the expectation that the Canucks could be among the teams to challenge for a playoff spot only to end up closer to a lottery spot rather than one in the postseason. It leaves the Canucks hypothetically facing two realities: One in which they find a way to extend what they did in the late part of last season into something that comes with long-term results. Or? The second is they're forced to once again search for the answer to the question of what will it take for them to find the success that has eluded them?\nX factor: What about the Canucks' goaltending? Last season, they used four goaltenders to get through a season that saw three of them play in more than 20 games. Of the three who had more than 20 games, none of them finished with a GAA below 3.00 with Thatcher Demko being the only one with a save percentage of more than .900 with a .901 mark. Demko and Spencer Martin are back with the notion that any improvements they show could play a major role in the Canucks trying to overcome the defensive challenges that plagued them throughout all of last season.\n\nFantasy outlook: Now healthy, Demko will have an easier time of it with new defenders Cole and Soucy aboard. The Canucks were significantly better defensively once Tocchet took over midseason. Poised to earn around 60 starts, Demko presents as a top-15 fantasy goalie once more.\nBold prediction: The Elias Pettersson contract speculation will loom over everything.\nLast season: 25-48-9, 59 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +15000\nKey players added: D Damon Severson, D Ivan Provorov\nKey players lost: None\nMost fascinating player: Adam Fantilli. Columbus needs a feel-good story to rally around. Fantilli could be it. The Blue Jackets' third overall pick is an exciting center prospect who should get a chance to showcase his talent early and often for the Blue Jackets. He's already shown some of that in the preseason, scoring his first goal in a Columbus uniform and appearing focused on transitioning seamlessly to the regular season. What happens for Fantilli when he gets there? How will he mesh into an offense that already includes the likes of Johnny Gaudreau and Patrik Laine, two players eager to see Columbus out of what was a dark, dismal, disappointing 2022-23? Inside and outside the organization there are undoubtedly high hopes for how Fantilli can put Columbus back on track.\nBest case: The Blue Jackets don't spiral out of the playoff conversation immediately (as they did a year ago) and instead find some consistent success out of the gate. With the Mike Babcock distraction dealt with already and new coach Pascal Vincent settled in, Columbus finds a rhythm from its forward group on down. The new additions of Severson and Provorov to the blue line -- plus the return of a healthy Zach Werenski -- turn Columbus' defense into a bona fide beast. After losing too much of last season to injury, a healthy Laine re-takes his mantle as a dominant scoring threat, Gaudreau emerges as a genuine superstar, Werenski plays a full 82-game slate anchoring the club's blue line and Elvis Merzlikins puts his best foot forward in the No. 1 netminder role. That combines to keep Columbus in the playoff hunt through April.\nWorst case: There's another wasted season ahead for Columbus. Despite Babcock departing in September, the fallout from the internal scandal doesn't dissipate as quickly and remains a distraction leading into the season. The Blue Jackets struggle to find their gait and injuries to key players pop up too often again. Fantilli can't find his footing against NHL competition, and that drags the Blue Jackets down physically and emotionally. Gaudreau can't find his best game, and Merzlikins has no help in front of him to keep pucks out of the net. The futility of watching another bad year play out leads GM Jarmo Kekalainen to make drastic changes across the board.\nX factor: Vincent. There's no way around it -- Vincent wasn't put in the best position to succeed. Stepping in when Babcock was being forced out is a tough spot to start from in your first NHL head coaching job, no matter how comfortable he might have already been within the Blue Jackets' organization. Beyond just that drama, Vincent has plenty on his shoulder all of a sudden trying to bring Columbus back from the proverbial brink. The organization can't keep wasting time and burning years off key contracts to top players. How well will Vincent tackle the challenge in front of him? The Blue Jackets' prospects this season might hang in the balance.\n\nFantasy outlook: The Blue Jackets massively upgraded their blue line this offseason, by virtue of Werenski returning to health in conjunction with trades for Severson and Provorov.\nBold prediction: Kekalainen is fired before next offseason.\nLast season: 37-38-7, 81 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Kevin Hayes\nKey players lost: F Josh Leivo, F Tyler Pitlick\nMost fascinating player: Hayes. What once began as a megadeal ultimately led to the Blues getting their much-coveted top-six center for a 2024 sixth-round pick while the Flyers also retained 50 percent of his salary. Part of what makes Hayes' arrival alluring is the fact he offers the Blues a venerable anchor down the middle with six 40-point seasons who also logged the third-most defensive zone starts by a Flyers forward last season. Having someone who can contribute on both ends could potentially play a role in the Blues reversing course on a 38-goal differential from last season that further amplified their struggles.\nBest case: Everything implemented by first-year Blues assistant Mike Weber allows the team to find the defensive cohesion that eluded them last season. Weber, who spent last season with the Rochester Americans in the AHL, was brought in to help organize a defensive structure that made the Blues one of the most porous teams in the league. Finding a solution for those issues could aid in providing more comfort for Jordan Binnington and promising rookie Joel Hofer, who only has eight games of NHL experience having spent the majority of the last two seasons in the AHL.\nWorst case: An inability to find some sort of defensive consistency. In most cases, a team with deficiencies in certain areas can use the offseason to retool those areas by potentially changing their personnel. Unless it's the Blues -- whose plans were rather complex and limited by the fact they have four defensemen who each have three more years left on their contracts -- earn more than $4 million annually with the additional caveat all of them have no-trade clauses. It's another reason why moves such as trading for Hayes, promoting Hofer and hiring Weber have a chance to play a vital role.\nX factor: It really is whatever Weber can do to turnaround the Blues' defensive issues. Focusing this much on an assistant coach can be considered a bit much. What justifies the discussion about Weber is the fact the Blues were in the bottom 10 in shots allowed per 60, goals allowed per 60, scoring chances allowed per 60 and high-danger chances per 60. Having that context along with the contract dynamics is what makes Weber and whatever he can accomplish with the Blues this season paramount to any progress they seek in 2023-24.\n\nFantasy outlook: While defender Torey Krug has the higher fantasy ceiling, it's worth noting Justin Faulk is coming off the most productive -- to the tune of 50 points -- season of his NHL career. Faulk also doesn't shy away from shooting on net and blocking opposing shots.\nBold prediction: Jordan Binnington gets his first fighting major.\nLast season: 28-40-14, 70 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +15000\nKey players added: F Nick Bjugstad, F Logan Cooley, D Travis Dermott, D Matt Dumba, D Sean Durzi, F Alexander Kerfoot, F Jason Zucker\nKey players lost: D Connor Mackey\nMost fascinating player: Cooley. An already noticeable offseason received even more attention when the Coyotes announced they signed Cooley to an entry-level contract. Cooley, who was the No. 3 pick from the 2022 NHL draft, announced in May that he would return to the University of Minnesota for his sophomore season only to then sign his ELC in late July. What made Cooley a lottery pick was the fact he's been projected as a two-way, top-six center. The 19-year-old used what ultimately became his only season at Minnesota to show what made him so promising by finishing his freshman year with 22 goals and 60 points in 39 games to help the Golden Gophers to a national title overtime defeat. And while the United States finished third at the U-20 World Junior Championships, Cooley excelled with seven goals and 14 points in seven games.\nBest case: Reaching the 30-win mark and/or the 80-point plateau could be used as something of a benchmark to evaluate the Coyotes' rebuild. The Coyotes haven't won more than 30 games since the 2019-20 season with their most recent 80-point campaign coming during the 2018-19 season. Keep in mind, the Coyotes went from a pair of consecutive seasons that saw them finish with less than 60 points to finishing with 70 points in 2022-23. A considerable amount of that progress was guided by members of their young core such as Barrett Hayton, Clayton Keller, Matias Maccelli, J.J. Moser and Nick Schmaltz. It's a group that has now added veterans such as Dumba, Kerfoot and Zucker in addition to an offseason trade that saw them add Durzi to further strengthen their roster.\nWorst case: Not living up to any of the intrigue they've created over the offseason. As it stands, the Coyotes are still in that space in which they finished 25 points out of a playoff spot while still being 12 points above the fewest points in the league. Yet they still reinforced their top-nine forward corps and top-four defensive options. Even if the Coyotes are nowhere near a playoff spot, they can still help themselves ahead of the trade deadline considering Dumba and Zucker are part of a six-player pending UFA class who could see some if its members get moved for draft capital.\nX factor: Winning on the road. Compare the Coyotes' home record to the rest of the NHL. They nearly won the same amount of home games as Stanley Cup contenders such as the Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers. Playing on the road, however, presented quite a few challenges as the Coyotes finished with a league-low seven victories. Part of what made their offseason haul considerably enterprising was the potential effect those new players could have. One way to measure that impact is if they can aid the Coyotes' young core in winning more games away from Mullett Arena.\n\nFantasy outlook: Keller is due to score a bunch again after erupting for 86 points in his sixth season. Los Angeles export Durzi is the most intriguing blue-line fantasy pick, as a threat to boot either Juuso Valimaki or Moser from the power play, while regularly contributing in other fantasy-relevant facets.\nBold prediction: André Tourigny gets a Jack Adams nomination.\nLast season: 31-45-6, 68 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: F Alex Newhook\nKey players lost: D Joel Edmundson\nMost fascinating player: Juraj Slafkovsky. Montreal shocked (or at the very least surprised) more than a few pundits when selecting Slafkovsky No. 1 overall in the 2022 NHL entry draft. Expectations were naturally high for Slafkovsky entering his rookie season, but the freshman produced a lackluster 10 points in his first 39 games. Slafkovsky's year ended there due to injury and now all eyes will be on how the sophomore bounces back. The Canadiens took a risk using their top pick on Slafkovsky, and granted he is only 19 with plenty of runway left to prove himself on. Will that begin to happen immediately when the new season starts? Or is Montreal going to be waiting even longer to see the best in Slafkovsky's game?\nBest case: The Canadiens need another strong season of growth for their youngest players. And that goes beyond just seeing Nick Suzuki, Cole Caufield, Slafkovsky and others have great statistical showings on the ice. Best case, Montreal's 2023-24 campaign also includes some sustained stretches of winning that allows its young core to truly taste what it means to be in the hunt for something -- to be chasing a significant outcome. Maybe that's just a few weeks of being on the playoff periphery and getting a feel for what that means. Maybe it's seeing consistency from their top-six and watching chemistry develop. Montreal just wants the needle to keep moving in a position direction.\nWorst case: Montreal's had its problems with injuries (Caufield, for instance, was out from January on last year following shoulder surgery). The Canadiens are tied to their young talents and when they go down, so do Montreal's chances of taking those necessary steps forward that will dictate the franchise's future. Beyond just good health, the Canadiens require more out of skaters like Kirby Dach (38 points in 58 games last season) and have to avoid letting guys like Suzuki fall into stagnant roles. Montreal can't let its foot off the gas now or be derailed by the things they can control -- like continuously putting players in the best position to succeed.\nX factor: Defense. Montreal was poor at defending off the rush last season. Too many pucks were going in the net and deflating the Canadiens prospects night after night. The Canadiens have to get more buy-in on the defensive side from their forward group, starting with top-six skaters like Josh Anderson. Montreal chose not to upgrade its goaltending tandem from Jake Allen and Samuel Montembeault, and a veteran like Edmundson won't be on the back end to provide support, either. Montreal has to address its defense in other ways if it's going to continue not only generating those key offensive opportunities but leave itself enough of a buffer for it to matter on the scoresheet.\n\nFantasy outlook: Rafael Harvey-Pinard put up huge numbers across just 34 games, so he'll be one to watch at the start of the season to see if he can repeat it.\nBold prediction: Dach becomes a solid No. 2 center.\nLast season: 31-38-13, 75 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: F Ryan Poehling, F Garnet Hathaway, D Marc Staal\nKey players lost: F Kevin Hayes, F James van Riemsdyk, D Ivan Provorov, D Tony DeAngelo\nMost fascinating player: Sean Couturier. The Flyers have needed a healthy Couturier back in the lineup, not just for what he adds on the scoresheet but in a leadership capacity as well. Philadelphia is deep in rebuilding mode and players like Couturier -- who hasn't played since December 2021 due to back issues -- are hard to come by (or quantify) in support of a team through its time of turbulence. Couturier is a former Selke Trophy winner, and his return should be a beacon of optimism for the Flyers as they move into what's likely to be another difficult season.\nBest case: Philadelphia is far from win-now mode. What qualifies as success is taking a step forward; simply being better than it was a year ago. The Flyers have exciting young players like Cam York who get much-needed experience against NHL talents and begin building confidence. Travis Konecny -- still with the team despite constant rumors he'd be traded -- ignites the Flyers' offense early and that does eventually allow GM Danny Briere to flip him at the trade deadline for valuable assets in Philadelphia's ongoing re-tool. The Flyers are fun, but don't hurt their chances of grabbing another good spot in the draft lottery.\nWorst case: The only downside for Philadelphia is being too good. The Flyers want to stock with the cupboards with another top prospect; that won't happen if they rack up too many wins. Coach John Tortorella getting greedy and pushing his team too hard that it turns into points in the standings hurts their ultimate position in the drafting ones. Briere can't find the right partners to engage with at the trade deadline and Philadelphia loses out there, too. The Flyers wind up picking too high at the draft in June and miss out on what might have been if they'd stumbled more in the regular season.\nX factor: Tortorella. When a coach hates to lose as much as he does, rebuilds can be agonizing. But it's what Philadelphia must go through to truly patch up the organization's holes. Can Tortorella stick to the plan without alienating any of his players in the process? He's managed that so far, it seems. The commitment to being patient has been palpable. It must remain that way for Philadelphia's sake. And riding any of the Flyers' prized prospects too harshly won't pay dividends, either. Philadelphia chose the waiting game, and everyone has to lean into.\n\nFantasy outlook: With Provorov and DeAngelo out the door, York has a clear path to power-play quarterback duties.\nBold prediction: Couturier will be comeback player of the year.\nTake a look back at some of the NHL's greatest rookie debuts as we await Connor Bedard's first game with the Blackhawks.\nLast season: 26-49-7, 59 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +17500\nKey players added: F Connor Bedard, F Colin Blackwell, F Taylor Hall, F Ryan Donato, F Nick Foligno, F Corey Perry\nKey players lost: D Ian Mitchell, F Jonathan Toews, G Alex Stalock\nMost fascinating player: Bedard. For years, he's been discussed as the NHL's next generational talent upon arrival. Now another set of expectations awaits the 18-year-old in that he's being charged with helping turn around an Original Six franchise that just moved on from icons Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews. Bedard is one of the primary figures of a rebuild that the Blackhawks believe can eventually see them go from a franchise that wins the lottery to one that can once again win the Stanley Cup. In the interim, it appears the more immediate focus for the Blackhawks is watching Bedard handle the demands of what comes with being a top-six, if not, top-line center in his maiden campaign.\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nBest case: Giving Bedard every possible chance to succeed with the understanding there are multiple ways to accomplish that goal. It started when the Blackhawks traded for Hall to give Bedard a veteran top-six scoring winger who also understands the demands that come with being the No. 1 pick in addition to winning a Hart Trophy. Bedard will likely receive the 5-on-5 and power-play minutes needed in order for him to start tapping into his potential as a top-line center. Those are a few of the on-ice avenues the Blackhawks could take. Another is ensuring they continue to add more to a farm system that is already considered to be among the strongest in the NHL.\nWorst case: Not doing enough to give their future the strongest possible chance for long-term success. While Bedard is now the centerpiece of their rebuild, he is not the only young player on the roster or trying to make the roster out of camp. The Blackhawks watched Philipp Kurashev score a career-best 25 points and average more than 17 minutes in ice time last season. They saw Lukas Reichel spend most of the season in the AHL only to emerge as full-time player in March who finished with seven goals and 15 points in 23 games. There's also the contributions that were made by several players under 25 such as Mackenzie Entwistle, Cole Guttman, Wyatt Kaiser, Boris Katchouk, Isaak Phillips, Taylor Raddysh, Filip Roos and Arvid Soderblom.\nX factor: Kevin Korchinski and Alex Vlasic. What they've both done in training camp is present the Blackhawks with two more prospects who appear ready to take the next step. Finding defensive consistency was an area of concern for a Blackhawks roster that was a consistent bottom five team in several defensive categories such as goals allowed per 60 and scoring chances allowed per 60. Enter Korchinski and Vlasic. Korchinski played last season for the WHL's Seattle Thunderbirds in a top-four role that saw him finish with 11 goals and 73 points in 54 games. Vlasic spent the majority of last year in the AHL but was a late-season call up who averaged more than 19 minutes in his six-game cameo.\n\nFantasy outlook: Defenseman Seth Jones projects to lead Chicago's blue line in scoring, with ease, in amassing 50 points or so and a good number of shots and blocked shots. Playing with Bedard at even strength and with the extra skater will boost Jones' fantasy potential.\nBold prediction: Bedard scores at least 35 goals.\nLast season: 23-47-12, 58 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: D Radko Gudas, F Alex Killorn, D Ilya Lyubushkin\nKey players lost: F Derek Grant, D Kevin Shattenkirk\nMost fascinating player: Jamie Drysdale. What has made the Ducks' future rather promising is the young talent they possess in the form of Mason McTavish, Troy Terry and Trevor Zegras. It's a list that includes Drysdale with the caveat that he's only had one full season considering he sustained a season-ending injury just eight games into the 2022-23 campaign. Getting a healthy Drysdale will give the Ducks a top-four, puck-moving defenseman who is one of the faces of a rebuild that has been heralded as having what's believed to be one of the strongest assortment of defensive prospects by an NHL club.\nBest case: Everything first-year coach Greg Cronin and his staff implements leads to the Ducks gradually improving over the regular season. One of the reasons why the Ducks hired Cronin is the notion he has used his career to develop the reputation as a developer and teacher who's constantly attempting to develop every part of a player's game. It's possible that Cronin's work could be parlayed into the Ducks winning more than 30 games and finishing with close to 80 points -- something they last achieved in the 2021-22 season only to follow that up with a 23-win campaign that saw them finish with just 58 points for the worst record in the NHL.\nWorst case: 339. The significance of that number is that it'd be one additional goal higher than the amount the Ducks allowed last year to clinch the not-so-coveted distinction of allowing the most goals in the NHL. Exactly how trying was last season for the Ducks? They finished last in shots allowed per 60, scoring chances allowed per 60, high-danger scoring chances allowed per 60 and high-danger goals allowed per 60 while finishing second to last in goals allowed per 60. It's another reason why the decisions to add Gudas, Killorn and Lyubushkin could prove valuable for the Ducks.\nX factor: Whatever happens with Leo Carlsson. Drafting Carlsson over Adam Fantilli with the No. 2 pick of last summer's NHL draft was one that generated a bit of discussion in what was an otherwise straightforward draft. Ducks GM Pat Verbeek stressed how Carlsson eventually became the club's \"unanimous\" decision after what he accomplished playing against older and more physically mature competition as the top-line center for Sweden at the IIHF Men's World Championships. They'll get some feedback on the decision soon, as he made the opening night NHL roster.\n\nFantasy outlook: Outside of dynasty competition, roster hopeful Carlsson merits monitoring instead of immediately drafting in all but the deepest fantasy leagues. Even if he manages to stick in the NHL for most of this season, a likely role in the bottom six won't reap immediate fantasy dividends.\nBold prediction: The Ducks' anniversary jersey becomes their primary one.\nLast season: 22-44-16, 60 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: G Mackenzie Blackwood, F Anthony Duclair, F Mikael Granlund, F Mike Hoffman, D Jan Rutta, F Givani Smith, F Filip Zadina\nKey players lost: D Erik Karlsson, F Andreas Johnsson, F Steven Lorentz, G James Reimer\nMost fascinating player: William Eklund. A torn labrum in late March limited Eklund, who the Sharks drafted seventh in 2021, to just eight NHL games. Still, the Sharks watched one of their top prospects score 17 goals and 41 points in 54 games while playing for the Sharks' AHL affiliate in what was his first season in North American hockey. The Sharks announced at the time of his injury they expected Eklund to return prior to the start of camp. Of course, that announcement was made well before an offseason that has led to the Sharks going through quite a few roster alterations.\nBest case: All their offseason trades help them reach their desired destination of having the strongest possible rebuild. Getting forwards such as Duclair, Granlund and Hoffman hypothetically offers the Sharks some options. For one, those three players give them a line's worth of offensive production they previously did not have. Yet what might become their greatest contribution is the fact all three are pending UFAs the Sharks could plausibly look to move for draft capital at or ahead of the NHL trade deadline. That along with a healthy Eklund playing a full season's worth of games could offer more insight into the Sharks' direction.\nWorst case: Not taking advantage of the ways to improve their future. Whether it be through the draft or trades, the last few years has seen the Sharks add to a prospect base that is led by Will Smith, Shakir Mukhamadullin, Filip Bystedt, Quentin Musty and Eklund. It's possible this season could see them strengthen what they already have. That's what makes their roster headlined by eight pending UFAs an item to watch. Parlaying a number of those players into draft capital and/or prospects would see them continue to build upon what they've done to this point. Failing to capitalize on that, however, could potentially add more time to their rebuild.\nX factor: All the talk about the Sharks possibly flipping parts of their roster ahead of the deadline for draft capital and prospects is made complicated by the fact they can only retain one more salary this season. CapFriendly shows they still have two more years left on Brent Burns' salary at $2.72 million annually while having four more years of Karlsson's contract at $1.5 million annually. One of the items that has allowed teams in the Sharks' position to maximize their leverage at the deadline is the ability to retain salary. Yet this season and next season places the Sharks facing some challenges compared to their counterparts who could be able to offer a contending team a better deal ahead or at the trade deadline.\nFantasy outlook: Whichever defenseman lands on San Jose's top power play -- be it Mario Ferraro or Jacob MacDonald -- deserves a little extra fantasy love from simply falling into that fruitful position.\nBold prediction: The Sharks win the draft lottery."}

(1:17)\nThe NHL is in a torch-passing mood as it enters the 2023-24 season.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights are the reigning Stanley Cup champions, having earned their first title since coming into the league in 2017 as an expansion team. The Seattle Kraken defeated the 2022 champs, the Colorado Avalanche, for their first playoff series win in their second season of existence.\nFor the first time in nine seasons, the top 10 scorers in the NHL were all under 30 years old, including Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson and Vancouver Canucks center Elias Pettersson, both just 24 years old.\nThen there's the rookie class for this season, a remarkably deep collection of talent led by 2023 first overall pick Connor Bedard, who has lifted the Chicago Blackhawks back to relevance before ever appearing in a regular-season NHL game.\nBut not everyone is ready to let go of the torch. Veteran teams like the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins are trying to raise the Cup again after major offseason changes. Meanwhile, the megastars in their prime on the Edmonton Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs are desperate to finally win their first rings.\nIf you haven't kept up with the NHL in the past few months, don't fret, we've got you covered. Here's a chance to catch up on everything that has happened -- the hirings, firings, signings and even a blockbuster trade. It's all in our guide to the 2023-24 season for lapsed fans. Read up before the puck drops on opening night this Tuesday!\nHow to watch the 2023-24 NHL season on ESPN networks -- including 100 exclusive games and the out-of-market package (over 1,050 games).\nThe biggest surprise about the Golden Knights lifting the Stanley Cup might have been that it wasn't the Bruins doing it instead.\nThe 2022-23 Bruins were the most successful regular-season team in NHL history, setting league records for wins (65) and points (135) in a season. The NHL awards confirmed that they had the league's best goalie (Linus Ullmark), best coach (Jim Montgomery) and best defensive forward (Patrice Bergeron), along with a 61-goal scorer in winger David Pastrnak. They were a juggernaut offensively and defensively. The question wasn't if they would win the Stanley Cup, but how long it would take them.\nAnd then they were upset in the first round by the Florida Panthers -- who would go on to face Vegas for the Stanley Cup -- losing at home in a Game 7 overtime that left Boston fans and players in stunned silence.\nIt wasn't just a loss on the ice for the Bruins. The offseason saw Bergeron, their much celebrated No. 1 center and captain, retire after 19 seasons. Their second-best center, David Krejci, retired after 16 seasons. The Bruins had made it their mission to send both of them off as champions. Instead, they have to pick themselves up off the canvas without them.\nThey aren't the only departures from Boston: Wingers Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno, Tyler Bertuzzi and defenseman Dmitry Orlov all switched teams in the offseason, too.\nCan new captain Brad Marchand and the Bruins who remain get back to the playoffs with these lineup holes? Is their defense corps, led by Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm, and goaltending (Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman) dominant enough to contend again? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nIf the Bruins falter, or another of last season's Eastern Conference playoff teams struggles, all eyes are on a trio of Atlantic Division teams that have been rebuilding towards getting back to the playoffs.\nThe Buffalo Sabres have garnered the most interest, having not made the playoffs since 2011. They have a newly minted star center in Tage Thompson and two great young defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.\nThe Ottawa Senators also have a breakout star in forward Tim Stutzle, who joins players like Brad Tkachuk and Claude Giroux in trying to get the Sens their first playoff spot since 2017 under new owner Michael Andlauer.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, who haven't made the playoffs since 2016, hope their mix of established veterans and younger talents finally brings GM Steve Yzerman's plans into sharper focus.\nTake a look back at some of the NHL's greatest rookie debuts as we await Connor Bedard's first game with the Blackhawks.\nBedard, 18, is the latest generational talent who had teams, ahem, \"rearranging their rosters\" in order to maximize their draft lottery odds. Chicago had the third-best odds when it won the lottery to secure the services of Bedard, selecting No. 1 overall for the first time since drafting Patrick Kane in 2007.\nThe hockey world had anticipated Bedard's NHL arrival for years. He was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. He racked up player of the year awards and led the Canadian junior team to two gold medals. Scouts have raved about the quality and accuracy of his shot, which produced 122 goals in 119 games over the past two seasons with the Regina Pats. He's unquestionably the most hyped rookie to arrive in the NHL since another Connor: Oilers star and reigning NHL MVP Connor McDavid, who was drafted in 2015.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBedard arrives during a transitional time for Chicago.\nThe Blackhawks' reputation is still on the mend after the 2021 investigation that made public the sexual assault allegations by former player Kyle Beach against the team's video coach Brad Aldrich during the 2010 season. Stan Bowman, the team's GM and president of hockey operations, and senior vice president of hockey operations Al MacIsaac both resigned in the aftermath, with current general manager Kyle Davidson taking over.\nKane and captain Jonathan Toews, the last on-ice links to the Blackhawks' three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, 2015), both parted ways with the franchise last season. In July, Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz died at 70 years old following an illness.\nBedard's arrival has certainly helped change the vibes for the Blackhawks.\nThe team sold $5.2 million worth of tickets after winning the draft lottery. The Blackhawks tell ESPN that they expect an increase of over 17% in tickets sold and overall 26% higher revenue growth than our initial 2023-24 season projections. They've nearly doubled their full season-ticket packages sold year over year.\nChicago hasn't made the playoffs in three seasons and probably won't again in Bedard's first season -- although the Blackhawks bolstered their rebuilding lineup with familiar names like Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. But they theoretically have their next franchise player and, more importantly, a point of demarcation with the past.\nBedard is far from the only notable first-year player in the NHL this season. In a league that's all about speed, scoring and low salary cap hits, more young players than ever are breaking into the NHL early. Some other rookies to watch this season:\nLogan Cooley had announced he was returning to the University of Minnesota, but instead the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 signed with the Arizona Coyotes ... where he will still play in an NCAA arena this season, but we digress.\nCenter Adam Fantilli, 18, was selected third overall in the 2023 draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets after being projected as the second-best prospect behind Bedard all season. (No. 2 overall was Leo Carlsson of the Anaheim Ducks.) The University of Michigan product won the Hobey Baker as the best men's player in the NCAA last season.\nAnother Michigan alum is defenseman Luke Hughes, who brought some chaotic energy to the New Jersey Devils' playoff run. He's expected to be an offensive force this season on a team that features his brother, star center Jack Hughes.\nGoalie Devon Levi could be entrusted by the Sabres to lead them to their first playoff berth since 2011. He dazzled in a brief stint with them last season.\nThe Maple Leafs made winger Matthew Knies untouchable at the trade deadline last season, and for good reason: The Hobey Baker finalist from Minnesota brings offensive skill and physicality in his game.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nKyle Dubas bet on himself as general manager of the Maple Leafs, entering last season without a contract beyond 2022-23. He seemingly won the wager, as the Leafs advanced past the opening round for the first time since 2004 by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning before losing to the Panthers.\n\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBut as Dubas' agent and team president Brendan Shanahan worked on a new contract, there was drama brewing. The ask from Dubas went up, and reportedly so did the amount of power he wanted in personnel decisions. Dubas held a news conference that didn't sit well with Shanahan, saying his future in Toronto required \"a full family discussion.\" Ultimately, Shanahan decided to let Dubas walk, hiring former Calgary GM Brad Treliving as his replacement.\nDubas also made it seem like it was Toronto or bust in that news conference, saying, \"I definitely don't have it in me to go anywhere else.\" Then the Penguins came calling after they fired team president Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall and ... well, maybe Pittsburgh isn't like anywhere else.\nDubas was named president of hockey operations and oversaw a search for the team's next general manager before finding the perfect candidate: Kyle Dubas, who will serve in that role for the foreseeable future. The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins, tasked him with two missions: Start thinking about what the next phase of this team looks like while doing everything he can to help the team's veteran core -- Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang -- become Stanley Cup champions for a fourth time since 2009.\nHis first move was a bit of managerial magic: a three-team trade that saw him move out some of the team's cap-problematic contracts while acquiring 33-year-old San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson, who won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman last season. Karlsson scored 101 points in 82 games. Another season like that, and the Penguins might have one more championship push left in them.\nBesides the Karlsson trade, there were other significant trades in the offseason:\nThe Los Angeles Kings acquired center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Winnipeg Jets in a package that included forwards Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi. A 25-year-old restricted free agent, Dubois was handed an eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois gives the Kings one of the deepest groups at center in the West, along with Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault.\nThe Devils, who defeated the New York Rangers for their first playoff series win since 2012, traded for winger Tyler Toffoli, who led the Calgary Flames with 34 goals last season.\nThe Avalanche acquired center Ryan Johansen from the Nashville Predators, who picked up half of his $8 million cap hit for the next two seasons to facilitate the trade.\nAfter scoring winger Alex DeBrincat made it clear that he wouldn't re-sign with the Senators, they sent him to the Red Wings in a trade that included a first-round pick and forward Dominik Kubalik.\nThe Blue Jackets added two veteran defensemen via trade, acquiring Ivan Provorov (Flyers) and Damon Severson (Devils). Severson received an eight-year, $50 million contract extension.\nThe St. Louis Blues benefited from the Philadelphia Flyers' salary dump, as they traded a sixth-round pick for center Kevin Hayes and had Philly pick up 50% of his salary for the remaining three years of the deal.\nSome interesting names ended up in even more interesting locations via free agency:\nThe NHL had a buyout window that was more active than usual. The players changing teams after having the remaining years on their contracts bought out included Jets captain Blake Wheeler, now with the Rangers; Predators center Matt Duchene, who signed with the Stars; winger Josh Bailey, who was traded to Chicago by the New York Islanders after 15 seasons, bought out by the Blackhawks, and then signed a professional tryout contract with the Senators; defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who was bought out by Vancouver and signed with the Panthers; and defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who now has the honor of being bought out by two different teams, with the Flyers ending his time in Philadelphia so he could rejoin the Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Bruins saw their two big trade deadline acquisitions move on. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, who were already stacked on defense, and Tyler Bertuzzi signed a one-year deal to play on Auston Matthews' wing with the Maple Leafs. Michael Bunting, who played with Matthews last season, signed with the Hurricanes. The Leafs also signed free agent defenseman John Klingberg to a one-year deal.\nStar center Ryan O'Reilly, who was picked up at the trade deadline by Toronto, surprised many by signing a four-year deal with the Predators.\nGoalie Joonas Korpisalo, one of the only big-name goalies available as free agency opened, inked a five-year contract with the Senators.\nWinger Alex Killorn, an essential role player on Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup teams, signed a four-year deal with the Ducks after 11 seasons with the Lightning.\nDefenseman Matt Dumba was cap-squeezed out of Minnesota and signed a one-year deal with the Coyotes.\nWinger James van Riemsdyk, defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and winger Milan Lucic all signed with the Bruins. It's a homecoming for Lucic, who was a fan favorite during eight years in Boston (2007-15).\nWinger Vladimir Tarasenko didn't find the deal he wanted in free agency, changed agents and then inked a one-year contract with the Senators.\nAmong the players who avoided free agency by re-signing with their teams are two Golden Knights playoff heroes in forward Ivan Barbashev (five years) and goalie Adin Hill (two years); goalie Tristan Jarry, who signed a five-year deal to stay with the Penguins; defenseman Scott Mayfield (seven years), who remained with the Islanders; goalies Frederik Andersen (two years) and Antti Raanta (one year), who stayed with the Hurricanes; and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who remained with the Kings on a two-year deal.\nOne name still available as the season begins: Patrick Kane, who split last season with the Blackhawks and Rangers before undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in the summer. He plans to play in 2023-24 and is waiting to see what the standings look like as the season progresses.\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews ended any speculation about his pending 2024 free agency by signing a four-year contract extension in August that gave him the highest annual average salary since the NHL instituted the cap: $13.25 million, topping the record Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon set in 2022 ($12.6 million).\nOther significant contract extensions included Devils forwards Jesper Bratt (eight years, $7.875 million AAV) and Timo Meier (eight years, $8.8 million AAV); Ducks forwards Troy Terry (seven years, $7 million AAV) and Trevor Zegras (three years, $5.75 million AAV); Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson (eight years, $8.05 million AAV); Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson (seven years, $6.5 million AAV); Red Wings winger Alex DeBrincat (four years, $7.875 million AAV); Hurricanes center Sebastian Aho (eight years, $9.75 million AAV); and Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin (eight years, $8.25 million AAV).\nThe situation between Mike Babcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets presented an existential question for hockey fans: Is it really a coaching change if a new coach never actually makes it to training camp?\nBabcock was officially hired by the Blue Jackets in July on a two-year deal worth $4 million per season, to much fanfare from the team.\nHe had won a Stanley Cup with Detroit, two Olympic golds with Team Canada, and is 12th all-time with 700 wins. But after he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, stories emerged about Babcock's mental abuse of players with the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. His tactics would be under scrutiny as he returned to the NHL.\nOn the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast in September, former NHL player and current TV analyst Paul Bissonnette claimed that Babcock asked Columbus captain Boone Jenner to show him his cellphone camera roll before displaying those photos via AirPlay on the coach's office wall.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nFormer NHL defenseman Mike Commodore, who played for Babcock and has been a long-standing critic of the coach, said he heard this behavior also occurred during Babcock's time coaching the Maple Leafs.\n\"It happened with a few other players in Columbus, too,\" Commodore said in a video posted to X. \"I don't want to use any names, but in particular [it involved] a young, very highly touted prospect.\"\nThese claims were enough to spark an NHLPA investigation of the situation, as new executive director Marty Walsh interviewed Blue Jackets players in Columbus. The NHLPA then presented its findings to the NHL, and the two entities informed the Blue Jackets. On Sept. 17, Babcock resigned as head coach of the Blue Jackets days before the start of training camp, with associate coach Pascal Vincent taking over as head coach.\n\"Upon reflection, it has become clear that continuing as head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets was going to be too much of a distraction,\" Babcock said in a statement released by the team.\nBlue Jackets management took the blame for the debacle. \"We went through a process earlier this summer prior to hiring Mike Babcock as our head coach, but we got it wrong and that's on us,\" team president John Davidson said.\nIn other less contentious NHL coaching moves, the Capitals parted ways with Peter Laviolette, who quickly found a new gig coaching the Rangers after they fired Gerard Gallant. The Capitals hired 44-year-old Leafs assistant Spencer Carbery. The Predators hired Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette, who was a Jack Adams finalist in 2022 with Florida. Ryan Huska replaced Darryl Sutter in Calgary, while Greg Cronin took over for Dallas Eakins in Anaheim.\nThe NHL has three outdoor games scheduled for the 2023-24 season:\nThe Oilers and Flames play at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL Edmonton Elks, in the Heritage Classic on Oct. 29.\nThe Kraken host the Golden Knights in the 2024 Winter Classic at T-Mobile Stadium, home the Seattle Mariners, on Jan. 1.\nMetLife Stadium -- which saw both a Taylor Swift concert and Taylor Swift, Chiefs fan, this year -- hosts another historic event in February 2024. The Devils will host the Flyers on Saturday, Feb. 17, in an outdoor night game. The Islanders will host the Rangers on Sunday, Feb. 18. The event will mark the first time four NHL teams have played outdoor games at the same venue in front of fans.\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend will be held on Feb. 2 and 3 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\nThe 26-year-old Edmonton star set new career highs with 64 goals and 153 points in 82 games last season, winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP for the third time and the Pearson Award for NHLPA player of the year for a fourth time. His point total jumped by 30 and his goals by 20 year over year. No one's really sure what his ceiling is statistically.\nUnfortunately for McDavid and his superstar teammate Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers have had a ceiling in the playoffs. After losing in the conference finals last season, Edmonton fell to the Golden Knights in the second round this season. McDavid and Draisaitl have yet to play for a Stanley Cup since McDavid entered the league in 2015. Is this the year?\nWhile teams like the Avalanche, Golden Knights, Lightning, Penguins and Kings seek another championship after recently winning the Cup, other teams considered among the top contenders are seeking to end significant droughts.\nThe Hurricanes (2006), Devils (2003), Stars (1999), Rangers (1994) and Oilers (1990) all have gone well over a decade without hoisting hockey's grail, while teams like the Minnesota Wild and Panthers have never won the Cup.\nAnd then there are the Maple Leafs, seeking their first Stanley Cup win since 1967 -- a 55-season drought that's the longest in the NHL.\nFinally, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin continues his journey to break one of the most seemingly unbreakable records in sports: Wayne Gretzky's 894 career NHL goals.\nAfter tallying 42 goals in 2022-23, Ovechkin has 822 career goals at the start the season. That's 72 goals to tie and 73 goals to pass Gretzky. So while the record-breaking moment probably has to wait until at least next season, it'll be fun to see how close Ovechkin can position himself to it during 2023-24.\nUnless he decides to score 73 goals and be done with it. We're never one to underestimate Mr. Ovechkin as a goal scorer."}
{"title": "Bulls' outlook for 2023-24: 'This is the year where we have to prove it'", "date": "2023-10-09 13:35:21", "text": "Quenton Jackson storms through the lane and delivers a posterizer on Andre Jackson Jr. (0:19)\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- THROUGHOUT his first nine seasons with the Toronto Raptors, DeMar DeRozan got used to his team traveling to a location outside of Toronto for the season's first week of practice -- a tradition many NBA teams follow in an effort to build chemistry. So after completing his first season with the Chicago Bulls in 2022, DeRozan began asking what the Bulls' plans were for their next training camp.\nDeRozan was surprised to hear the answer: Chicago, again.\nThe Bulls had not held an out-of-state training camp since 1985, when they were hosted by Beloit College in Wisconsin. Yet DeRozan remembered fondly how a road training camp brought on a camaraderie with his teammates.\n\"Sometimes you've got to get outside your house and do something adventurous,\" DeRozan told ESPN. \"Find anything to bring y'all closer.\"\nChicago's management took DeRozan's suggestion and ran with it, getting buy-in from the entire organization. The result? The Bulls hosted training camp at Belmont University in Nashville, the team's first out-of-state training camp since Michael Jordan's second year in the NBA.\nThe players played Top Golf together; went to team dinners, pranking 19-year-old rookie Julian Phillips with a $13,000 dinner bill -- \"I didn't even know food could cost that much,\" he wrote on his Instagram -- and toured the Tennessee Titans' facility, where DeRozan showed off some uncanny quarterbacking skills.\nHere's @DeMar_DeRozan casually launching the ball from the 10 to the opposite 20 😳 pic.twitter.com/NWiUzX1kyB\nIt was Chicago's way of trying to give its team a fresh start, even though its roster is nearly the same as it was one year ago when it lost in the play-in tournament to the Miami Heat and missed the postseason.\n\"We got to get back to the postseason,\" Bulls guard Zach LaVine told ESPN. \"Obviously we did that our first year and didn't have a good first-round result. ... Everybody has their own personal expectations and expectations as a team. For us, it's consistency and [making] sure we're playing after the 82nd game.\"\nThe Bulls are entering their third season with a team built around the core of DeRozan, LaVine and Nikola Vucevic. But while the top teams in the Eastern Conference shook up their rosters this offseason, the Bulls doubled down on continuity, believing the ceiling on their team is higher than their record so far has shown.\nAfter a fast start to their first season together fueled by stellar point guard play from Lonzo Ball, the Bulls made the 2022 playoffs, before being dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. This year's roster is nearly identical to that team. The Bulls are bringing back their top seven players by minutes played from the 2022-23 season, each of whom were also on the 2021-22 squad. Aside from a few tweaks -- signing Jevon Carter and Torrey Craig in free agency -- this team is virtually the same, with both coming off disappointing finishes. But the plan isn't just to run it back, as the preseason trip to Nashville showed.\n\"One of the things we talked about, you're bringing back the same group, we have to do something different,\" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. \"You can't just do the same exact thing and expect different results.\"\nNO TRIO IN the NBA played more minutes together (1,642) last season than DeRozan, Vucevic and LaVine. Yet the Bulls were outscored during those minutes by 13 points.\nChicago found its groove as a team after the All-Star break, going 14-9 and upsetting Toronto during the play-in tournament. But even during that stretch, the team was outscored by nine points in 492 minutes after the break when its top three players shared the floor.\nThe tricky part for Chicago is that all three players played well individually throughout the season.\nDeRozan continued to be a master in the midrange, making a league-best 317 midrange shots last season (134 more than any other player) while ranking second in clutch points, trailing only De'Aaron Fox, the NBA's inaugural Clutch Player of the Year. Vucevic, who received a three-year contract extension during the offseason, played in every game last season and finished with a 57% effective field goal percentage and shot 59% on 2-pointers, both of which were career bests. After being slowed at the start of the season coming off offseason surgery, LaVine averaged 27.2 points and shot 52% from the field over the final two months.\n\"We've all had really good seasons, but we haven't put it together as a team,\" LaVine said. \"This is the year where we have to prove it. You have to put pen to paper. Three years is a lot of time to show what you have.\"\nWhen the Bulls assembled this trio, they envisioned Ball as the point guard who could serve as the connector for their offense, which ranked 24th in the NBA last season despite having three dynamic scorers.\nThe Bulls were 27-13 and in first place in the Eastern Conference when Ball played his last game in January 2022. Since then, they have gone 47-57 in his absence. It's why Ball called the Bulls one of the NBA's big what-ifs during an appearance on Trae Young's podcast this summer, saying he believes Chicago had built the \"perfect team around him.\"\n\"That's part of the reason why this team is still together,\" Ball told ESPN. \"I actually think we're still trying to play the same way as if I was still here. It's not like we're getting away from the core values that I had on the court. We're trying to keep it fast pace, go, get out and play defense. Everything is kind of in tune for me to come back, whenever that is.\"\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Win projections for 30 teams\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBall has already been ruled out for the 2023-24 season after undergoing cartilage transplant surgery in March, his third knee surgery since his last appearance in an NBA game.\n\"Guys have been accustomed to him not playing,\" Donovan told ESPN. \"It's been two years now.\"\nKnowing Ball won't be available has helped the team manage expectations going into this season, compared with last season, when they continually held out hope that a Ball comeback would save them.\n\"I think last year we were thinking, 'When Lonzo comes back, it'll be different,'\" Vucevic said on media day. \"I think this year we have a clear picture that he's not going to be back. We have to find other ways to run our offense without putting so much pressure on Zach and DeMar handling the ball and scoring, doing everything.\"\nPart of that involves modernizing an offense that averaged 28.9 3-point attempts per game a season ago, the fewest in the NBA. Bulls executive vice president Arturas Karnisovas said on media day that the team was looking to play faster, but DeRozan explained that might not look like what fans are expecting.\n\"People get so caught up in the word fast like it's a million miles per hour up and down the court,\" he said. \"Showtime Lakers. Trying to put up 140 points.\n\"The fast aspect of it is just faster decision making. Quicker decision making. Not necessarily just up-and-down, up-and-down. Shot. Shot. But understanding how to be more effective by making faster and quicker decisions on the go. We do have the personnel to be able to do that\"\nWhile Ball remains hopeful he'll return to the Bulls in 2024-25, it remains to be seen which teammates he'll be rejoining.\nRival teams have checked in with the Bulls about LaVine's availability, team and league sources told ESPN, but no team has been willing to meet Chicago's reportedly large asking price. LaVine, 28, is owed $129 million over the next three seasons and owns a $48.9 million dollar player option in 2026-27.\nLaVine says being the subject of trade speculation has not bothered him.\n\n\n• Sign up and play for free!\n• 10 tips to help you win your league\n• Sleepers, breakouts and busts\n• \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list\n\"My camp isn't putting them out,\" LaVine said. \"I committed to the Bulls when I signed my five-year deal. So until I'm not, I'm committed to the Bulls. I've always brought professionalism and consistent play and that's what I'll continue to do.\n\"I love Chicago, I've always wanted to be in a place that wanted me and Chicago showed me that. But obviously trade rumors are part of the business. Are they wanted? No. But I'm a grown man, I've been traded before. I know how to deal with them. You have to take it that way, it's a business, so I don't get too upset.\"\nMeanwhile, DeRozan, 34, is entering the final season of his contract and is set to earn $28.6 million. The Bulls have expressed interest in re-signing DeRozan to a long-term deal and the two sides have had preliminary talks negotiating an extension, sources told ESPN.\n\"We have to make sure this is the right group,\" Karnisovas said at media day. \"I believe in them, I have faith in them and going into the season we'll see how the season is going to play out.\"\nDespite the team's struggles, DeRozan remains committed to winning in Chicago. The team and city accepted him after he spent three seasons in San Antonio feeling like he was in NBA obscurity. Now DeRozan wants to finish his story by bringing the Bulls postseason success the franchise has been starved for since their last title in 1998.\n\"I told a couple guys last year, 'I want to see you win. I want y'all to witness what it feels like to win and what comes with winning and being appreciated and called a winner,'\" DeRozan said. \"That's just my optimistic mindset when it comes to this. I put my all into it.\n\"As much as it's sucked losing, there's always a beauty in the journey. ... Everything can't go fine and dandy, but with that how do you accept the challenge that comes with it. That's my mindset when I look at it, this is a hell of a journey, let's make this journey worth it.\""}
{"title": "Is Davante Adams satisfied? The Raiders star opens up ahead of MNF against his former team", "date": "2023-10-09 13:13:07", "text": "Tristan H. Cockcroft says Raiders WR Davante Adams remains locked in as a WR1 and could have additional motivation in Week 5 against his former team. (1:05)\nHENDERSON, Nev. -- Davante Adams has been busy since agreeing to a blockbuster trade in March 2022 to leave the only professional organization he had ever known in the Green Bay Packers to join the team he grew up rooting for in the Raiders. For starters, he signed a five-year contract with Las Vegas worth $140 million.\nSince then, he's been targeted a league-leading 229 times in 21 games. Adams has also caught 133 passes for 1,913 yards and an NFL-high 17 touchdowns -- including 33 receptions for 397 yards and three touchdowns this season. He was also named first-team All-Pro for the third straight year and selected to his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl after the 2022 season.\nYet despite all of his individual brilliance, the Raiders are 7-14 with him, including a frustrating 1-3 start to this season with a fresh controversy seemingly enveloping the franchise on a weekly basis.\nSurely, this couldn't have been what Adams was expecting when he left Titletown for Sin City.\n\"I didn't really have any expectations,\" Adams told ESPN.com recently. \"But it's not what I wanted, for sure. Obviously, I wanted to come here and have a big impact, continue to play at a high level and win games. And a lot of those things have happened -- just not the winning part. But I've just got to continue to do more and keep demanding greatness and consistency for my teammates.\n\"It's a gamble sometimes. You never really know.\"\nAt a position known for being full of me-first players, Adams, 30, is cut a bit differently. He doesn't preen or call attention to himself. He simply goes about his job while making other players look silly -- the defensive backs trying to cover him. It caught Raiders receiver Jakobi Meyers off guard when Meyers joined Las Vegas in free agency this offseason.\n\"He'd go out there, run hard, take hits, get back up, make the exciting play, make the basic play, the routine fundamental play,\" Meyers said. \"I mean, he's just a well-rounded receiver. He really can do it all. And the want to. He wants to do it all. He wants to be out there every play. He's inspirational, man. ...We're just chasing him.\n\"He has every right to be a diva, he definitely could be. But that's not him, man. He's a hard-working, head-to-the-ground, go-make-my-plays type of guy. So, respect to him.\"\nBut the losses are piling up, as the Raiders have suffered from blown leads, failure to get over the hump and losses in winnable games. After all, the Raiders are 5-11 in one-score games since the start of the 2022 season, a win percentage that's 27th in the NFL.\nAnd with his old team coming to town for \"Monday Night Football\" (8:15 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN) and Cheeseheads threatening to take over Allegiant Stadium, Adams is not about to make any concrete \"claims\" about his future, even as his concerns battle the team-first mentality and work ethic which has earned him praise throughout the Raiders' locker room.\n\"What's most important to me is going to the Super Bowl. I've been to four NFC championship games in Green Bay in eight years,\" Adams said. \"So, I've won a lot of games in the regular season. I've got a lot of stats. What I haven't done is check that box of winning the Super Bowl.\n\"I'm trying to create something special here. I can only do so much on my individual end. ... you don't fluke into the Super Bowl; you do it a certain way to win the Super Bowl.\"\nTHE BALL THROWN by rookie quarterback Aidan O'Connell -- who got the start in Week 4 when starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was ruled out due to a concussion -- was behind Adams as he went across the middle on a deep route at SoFi Stadium. Adams took a shot to his right shoulder when Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Michael Davis drove him into the artificial turf, stayed on the ground and was taken to the locker room for examination.\nIt was early in the second quarter, and despite being listed as questionable to return, Adams was back on the field before halftime. He caught eight passes in the second half to help lead a Raiders' comeback effort that fell short. Adams sat out practice on Thursday and Friday and was a limited participant Saturday due to that shoulder and is listed as questionable to play Monday.\n\"He's a warrior, and to come back in and play the way that he did after that, I give him, obviously, all the credit in the world,\" Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said. \"He's a tough son of a gun and what a great team player.\n\"One of the more unique players and people that I've been around.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nOn the field, McDaniels said Adams has seen \"every defense known to mankind\" and still excels.\n\"He's got a perspective that's very unique and rare,\" McDaniels said. \"And his skill and his talent, it's at the highest level. He plays at an incredible speed, his hands, his length, his reach, his ability to twist and turn and make tough catches. I mean, it's a privilege to coach guys like that because you don't get to see that every day.\"\nOff the field?\n\"He's a very mature guy,\" McDaniels said. \"He's a great dad, great husband, great son, great friend and very honest and open with his dialogue about whatever. Any way he could help the team -- he's an incredible captain.\n\"Just a really unique individual, unique player, special in every way. Hall of Famer.\"\nBut Adams is also human with an inner conflict -- trying to balance the Raiders' inability to forge a consistent and successful path with his personal success -- that's pulling him in different directions. In the spring, after the Raiders moved on from nine-year starting quarterback Derek Carr, his college teammate at Fresno State, and signed Garoppolo, Adams said he didn't see \"eye-to-eye\" with the Raiders' decision makers.\nAfter a disappointing Week 3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Adams said he didn't have \"time to wait around\" for the Raiders to get right and talked about the \"culture\" having to change.\nBut slip-ups aside, Adams continues to build his résumé for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Consider: With a touchdown catch against the Packers, he will pass Antonio Brown and Jimmy Graham for the fourth-most TD catches in prime-time games in NFL history with 32. Only Hall of Famers Jerry Rice (46), Randy Moss (44) and Terrell Owens (34) have more. Plus, with 802 career catches for 10,034 yards and 90 TDs, Adams ranks 14th on the all-time TD reception list and is about two seasons away from joining the NFL's top 20 lists in catches and receiving yards, barring injury.\nHe's not the fastest or the quickest, but Adams is eternally open.\nRaiders cornerback Nate Hobbs credits Adams' use of leverage and his ability to change direction on a dime. That, and Adams never taking a play off. It seems simple, but he runs every route as if the ball is coming his way, even if it's a run play, making it a battle of conditioning and, thus, attrition, with an unsuspecting defensive back.\n\"He always has a plan, and it could change in a split second,\" said Hobbs, who wanted one-on-one reps with Adams in his first camp with the Raiders and quickly found out. \"He'll leverage you inside and you don't expect that, so he'll convert and have me on a different route. He makes every route look the same.\n\"Plus, the way he goes and gets the ball when it's in the air, he's like on a Steph Curry level. You know how Steph could shoot and he can close his eyes and hit it? Last year several times, he couldn't even see the ball, and he caught the ball. With one hand. Like, he's on that level, that Curry level when it comes to catching balls. He's a real expert at it. All that together makes it really tough to guard. He's unpredictable.\"\nWHILE MORE THAN a few of the names and faces have changed, a certain sense of familiarity is bound to come over Adams on Monday night when he looks across the field and sees that iconic gold and dark green helmet with the oversized 'G' on the side. The helmet he wore from 2014, when the Packers drafted him in the second round, through 2021, when it was simply time to go and get closer to his family and friends on the West Coast.\nIt's a helmet Adams wore as he advanced to the precipice of the Super Bowl four times, with the Packers losing in the NFC Championship Game in 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2020.\n\"It'll be weird,\" Adams said with a grin. \"I'll get over it by the time the game starts. But going over there, coming out of the tunnel, seeing them over there, it'll be weird. I haven't experienced, obviously, I haven't played against the Packers before, so it'll be fun.\n\"It'll be good to see some [familiar] faces and compete against those boys at a different level, too.\"\nPat McAfee breaks down everything that has gone wrong in Josh McDaniels' reign as Raiders coach.\nComing out of the game with a win, though, would be more than that for Adams and the Raiders. Perhaps it would halt, momentarily at least, the narrative that Adams is unhappy. That the Raiders will have to at least entertain the thought of trading him for a bounty of picks, even if the dead money hit -- $7.85 million this year, $23.55 million in 2024 -- would be daunting.\nA victory could confirm what Adams has been saying all along -- that the Raiders have too much talent to not be relevant in the second half of the season.\n\"I'm just trying to stay centered and stay focused on the ultimate goal, which is winning games,\" he said. \"It's the cliché answer, but that's really all I can do. ... My job is to play, and the front office, their job is to do what they do. It's just the easiest way to not live on a roller coaster, this up and down world, just take care of what I can take care of. And as much as I can contribute to that, I'm going to do that.\n\"And that's how you build a winning culture. So, when I [say] we haven't established a winning culture, it's more about what we can do as players, more than the philosophies and the ideas. Because everything that they preach here, the way we talk about it and the way they want it done, is the right way.\"\nYes, even when it comes to not seeing eye-to-eye on certain things.\nOf course, Adams could not have foreseen Carr being cut and leaving for the New Orleans Saints after less than one season together in Las Vegas. But Carr was not the only reason Adams, who rocked a Charles Woodson jersey for third-grade picture day while saying he wanted to play for the Raiders, came to southern Nevada.\nAnd until Garoppolo was concussed, Adams was building a certain and sudden trust with his new quarterback. Not an easy thing to do considering Adams has really only had two quarterbacks since graduating from Palo Alto High School in 2011 -- Carr at Fresno State, Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and Carr again with the Raiders.\n• Biggest questions, risers, fallers »\n• Graziano judges overreactions »\n• Fantasy winners and losers (ESPN+) »\n• Full Week 5 scoreboard » | More »\n\"Jimmy's an easy guy to work with because he's one of the best that I've been around at any position, let alone quarterback, of taking accountability,\" Adams said. \"Not taking anything away from Derek and Aaron, but Jimmy does a good job of not coming in acting like he knows everything. He's open to suggestions and me talking through ways that I've done in the past.\"\nWhich brings it full circle to Adams saying it's all a gamble anyway. And with this being Las Vegas, he just doesn't want to crap out, or roll snake eyes.\n\"Some things are going to work out better in the offseason, whether it's free agents or if it's draft picks,\" said Adams, who got off to a slow start in his career with 88 catches and four touchdown catches in his first two seasons combined, and did not go over 1,000 yards receiving in a single season until his fifth year in the NFL.\n\"It's also a process of this thing takes time to develop, so you can't count your chickens until they hatch. Because if we would've done that, then there would've been no Davante Adams at this point.\""}
{"title": "'It's gonna be awesome': Packers/Raiders' kicking Carlson brothers ready for first battle", "date": "2023-10-09 13:13:07", "text": "LAS VEGAS -- Hans Carlson had a choice to make. It was the afternoon of Sept. 18, 2018, and he was at Chicago O’Hare International Airport waiting to see if the Minnesota Vikings-Green Bay Packers game would end before his flight home to Colorado Springs took off.\nThe game, of course, went to overtime.\n“I decided to miss my flight,” he said.\nMixed in with a gaggle of Packers fans in front of a television in Terminal 1, Carlson watched in silence. Each time the Vikings kicker lined up for a field goal -- a 49-yard attempt on the first possession of overtime and then an attempt to win the game with a 35-yarder on the final play -- the same thing happened.\n“The Packers fans started screaming, ‘He’s going to miss it,’” Carlson recalled. “And of course, he did. The Packers fans kept saying, 'We love Daniel Carlson.'\"\nHans, Daniel’s father, didn’t say a word.\nIt wasn’t a great weekend for the Carlsons from the start. Hans had a layover in Chicago because he was on his way back from watching his youngest son, Anders Carlson. Then a redshirt freshman at Auburn, where he followed in Daniel’s footsteps, Anders missed a 52-yard field goal in the fourth quarter of a 22-21 loss to LSU.\nFast-forward more than five years, and the Carlsons won’t be forced to pick watching one son over the other. On the stage of \"Monday Night Football\" at Allegiant Stadium (8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC), Daniel, the Las Vegas Raiders' All-Pro kicker, and Anders, the Packers rookie who has yet to miss a kick this season, will finally play in the same game.\n“What will that be like?” Jodie Carlson, their mother, said to ESPN during a joint interview with her husband, Hans, just days before kickoff. “No idea because it’s never happened before.”\nIn fact, it will be the first time the entire Carlson crew -- including oldest son, Nils, who is flying in from Sweden -- will be in the same place at the same time since Anders’ wedding in June 2022.\nFor years, Hans and Jodie tried to maximize their opportunities to see their two kicking sons perform. The boys were never in high school at the same time, so when Daniel kicked at Auburn, Anders was back in Colorado Springs. By the time Anders became Auburn’s kicker in 2018, Daniel was already in the NFL, having been drafted in the fifth round by the Vikings that year.\nThe only time they were on the same team was at Auburn in 2017, Daniel’s final season, but Anders redshirted.\nAnders admitted recently he had no idea how his parents managed to see as many of their games as they did, although Jodie’s job as a flight attendant for United helped, and it’s still a wonder how they’ll keep this up with two kids in different NFL cities.\n“Well, Week 5’s easy,” Anders joked, referring to Monday night’s game. “There’s only one spot to go to.”\nThe Carlson kids were typical hypercompetitive brothers -- or at least typical for having a father who came to the United States from Sweden on a tennis scholarship to the University of Alabama. That’s where Hans met Jodie, whose father played baseball for the Crimson Tide.\nBest of NFL Nation• Is Davante Adams satisfied?\n• Kicking Carlsons ready for first battle\n• Porter Jr. makes case to start\n• Broncos struggling vs. the run\n• Kelce returns to deliver big plays\n• Bills face tough road with injuries\nNils, the oldest of the three, could be credited with turning his younger brothers into kickers.“Nils was the one who made them good because he was a soccer goalie,” Hans said. “They used to take shots at him every summer, thousands of shots.”Hans coached them in tennis and encouraged them to try everything from golf to basketball. According to Anders, the games of driveway basketball with Daniel were more than just friendly pickup games, and the tennis matches still go on to this day.“I was the better basketball player,” Anders insists. “He was the more physical guy, though. He had the height, so those were even matches. My dad’s a tennis coach, so a lot of tennis matches. Playing soccer, whatever it was, we were always competing.”Daniel's version is slightly different.“I’m like 1 million-and-0 in brotherly competition,\" Daniel said. \"But we’re 0-0 overall in football competition. So this is really special. … This will be a first and hopefully not a last.”Of all the commonalities between Anders and Daniel, current Packers special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia might be the most important one. Most bios of Bisaccia don’t even include his stop at Auburn. But he spent a month there early in 2013 between NFL jobs with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys. In that brief time, he recruited Daniel. The two would be reunited in 2018 with the Raiders, where Bisaccia ran the special teams.The Raiders signed Daniel a few weeks after the Vikings cut him the day after the debacle in Lambeau, just two games into his NFL career. Bisaccia helped turn Daniel into one of the NFL’s most consistent kickers. In six seasons with the Raiders, he has made 90.1% of his field goals.This offseason, Bisaccia went to bat for Anders, and the Packers took him in the sixth round as they were looking to replace longtime kicker Mason Crosby. After a rocky training camp and preseason, Anders to date has avoided the kind of struggle Daniel had early in his career with the Vikings. He has made everything so far: 5-for-5 on field goals, including a 52-yarder against the Chicago Bears in Week 1, and 9-for-9 on extra points.“I think the thing that's been good for Anders is some of the difficulties that Daniel has had, Anders has had the opportunity to learn from,” Bisaccia said. “So I think that's the one thing probably that he's taken from his brother, but I still think the guiding force to those two is the dad. Dad's an ultracompetitive tennis guy, and I think he's really been a force for both of those guys.”The Packers drafted Anders Carlson in Round 6 of the 2023 NFL draft. After four games, he has yet to miss a field goal attempt (5-for-5) or PAT (9-for-9). Mark Hoffman-USA TODAY SportsLast month, when the NFL season began, the Raiders opened at the Broncos.

He has helped Anders plenty along the way, but when his younger brother got drafted by the Packers, Daniel offered no advice when the subject turned to kicking at Lambeau Field.\"The first time, I couldn’t figure it out,\" Daniel said. \"Obviously.\"ESPN Raiders reporter Paul Gutierrez contributed to this story.\n\n• Is Davante Adams satisfied?\n• Kicking Carlsons ready for first battle\n• Porter Jr. makes case to start\n• Broncos struggling vs. the run\n• Kelce returns to deliver big plays\n• Bills face tough road with injuries\nNils, the oldest of the three, could be credited with turning his younger brothers into kickers.\n“Nils was the one who made them good because he was a soccer goalie,” Hans said. “They used to take shots at him every summer, thousands of shots.”\nHans coached them in tennis and encouraged them to try everything from golf to basketball. According to Anders, the games of driveway basketball with Daniel were more than just friendly pickup games, and the tennis matches still go on to this day.\n“I was the better basketball player,” Anders insists. “He was the more physical guy, though. He had the height, so those were even matches. My dad’s a tennis coach, so a lot of tennis matches. Playing soccer, whatever it was, we were always competing.”\nDaniel's version is slightly different.\n“I’m like 1 million-and-0 in brotherly competition,\" Daniel said. \"But we’re 0-0 overall in football competition. So this is really special. … This will be a first and hopefully not a last.”\nOf all the commonalities between Anders and Daniel, current Packers special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia might be the most important one. Most bios of Bisaccia don’t even include his stop at Auburn. But he spent a month there early in 2013 between NFL jobs with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys. In that brief time, he recruited Daniel. The two would be reunited in 2018 with the Raiders, where Bisaccia ran the special teams.\nThe Raiders signed Daniel a few weeks after the Vikings cut him the day after the debacle in Lambeau, just two games into his NFL career. Bisaccia helped turn Daniel into one of the NFL’s most consistent kickers. In six seasons with the Raiders, he has made 90.1% of his field goals.\nThis offseason, Bisaccia went to bat for Anders, and the Packers took him in the sixth round as they were looking to replace longtime kicker Mason Crosby. After a rocky training camp and preseason, Anders to date has avoided the kind of struggle Daniel had early in his career with the Vikings. He has made everything so far: 5-for-5 on field goals, including a 52-yarder against the Chicago Bears in Week 1, and 9-for-9 on extra points.\n“I think the thing that's been good for Anders is some of the difficulties that Daniel has had, Anders has had the opportunity to learn from,” Bisaccia said. “So I think that's the one thing probably that he's taken from his brother, but I still think the guiding force to those two is the dad. Dad's an ultracompetitive tennis guy, and I think he's really been a force for both of those guys.”\nLast month, when the NFL season began, the Raiders opened at the Broncos. It meant Daniel would be playing close to the family's Colorado Springs home.

(0:26)\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks were hosting the Kansas City Royals in May 2022, and D-backs ace Zac Gallen couldn't help himself. He had watched a 21-year-old phenom make his presence felt over the field against his team for two straight days and wondered what it would be like to have a talent like that on his side.\n\"I saw Bobby Witt Jr. play and I joked with our front office, 'Hey where's our guy that's young, comes up and plays like that?'\" Gallen recalled. \"They immediately said, 'Just wait, he's on his way.'\"\nFour months later, Corbin Carroll arrived in Arizona -- and he hasn't stopped proving his front office right since. Now, under the bright lights of the MLB postseason, the rest of the baseball world is about to see what Gallen and his D-backs teammates have seen for just over a year now.\nCarroll was called up to the big leagues for the final month, getting his first taste of the majors and giving Arizona a look at what was to come when he slugged .500 with an .830 OPS in 32 games.\nThis season Carroll took his game to new heights. After signing an eight-year, $111 million deal during spring training, he blew past Witt's rookie numbers and became the first player in major league history to amass at least 25 home runs, 10 triples and 50 stolen bases in a single season. Add 30 doubles and stellar outfield play to his résumé, and Carroll is the runaway favorite for National League Rookie of the Year. He has risen to the occasion early in his first postseason as well, putting up an otherworldly 1.655 OPS.\nAs Carroll makes his October introduction to a national audience with every hard-hit ball, dash around the bases and incredible play in the field, we asked five of his teammates to describe what it's like to witness the emergence of MLB's next superstar outfielder on a daily basis.\nThe work ethic\nThe first thing Carroll's teammates pointed to was an approach to the game that far exceeds his age. The D-backs outfielder is often the first to show up and last to leave, but this goes even further: Carroll has already mastered the mental side in a way that impresses even a 16-year MLB veteran he's sharing the clubhouse with this season. \nEvan Longoria: \"He's so regimented. Everything he does, every day. He has a plan. He prepares the right way. I think of myself at that age, I had none of that. He's had that from the time I met him. That's part of what makes him so successful. Sticking to that routine. That's not easy when you're young in this game.\"\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nGallen: \"In 2021, we were losing 110 games and he was coming to the field, watching our games. He's learning the game while we're losing like that. He's so committed. Stomaching that season with us and taking what he learned into his career.\"\nLongoria: \"Watching him develop, he overcame any adversity very quickly. He was getting breaking ball after breaking ball and then went into the cage and worked on hitting those and the slump was short lived.\nThe tools\nCarroll was selected with the 16th overall pick in the 2019 MLB draft and rose to the No. 2 spot on ESPN's Kiley McDaniel's 2023 preseason prospect rankings, but in large part because of his unassuming frame -- Carroll stands just 5-foot-10, 165 pounds -- his dynamic skill set on the diamond still has a tendency to sneak up on you. The advice from his teammates as you take in the speedy outfielder for the first time this October? Don't be surprised by anything he can do -- in any aspect of the game. \nTommy Pham: \"He's a great player. He has every tool. I guess he could improve his arm strength? He covers so much ground. He can hit. He hits line drives everywhere. And the speed is so elite. He turns singles into doubles and doubles into triples. He's the best baserunner in the game right now.\"\nChristian Walker: \"Watching him play is so exciting. He's never too far down and he never gets too high on himself. He's just always in it. He's so intentful in every moment. You can tell that by talking to the guy. He's so smart and super talented. That's a great combination. He's the total package.\"\nLongoria: \"When I first signed, I went over to Salt River [Arizona's spring training facility in Scottsdale] to hit in mid-January, and he was there. The pop was electric. I knew he could run.\"\nThe leadership\nCarroll has played a grand total of 187 regular-season games and already been anointed the face of his franchise, rewarded with a nine-figure contract and put in the spotlight as the breakout star for a pop-up National League contender. That kind of adoration so quickly could go straight to a player's head, right? Not in this case, as Carroll prefers to let his game do the talking. Well, on the baseball field, at least. \nAlek Thomas: \"We grew up in the system together. To see him have this year he's having is unbelievable. He goes out there, younger than me, and acts like he's been around for 5-6 years. He leads by example.\"\nWe've got you covered on all things October baseball.\nSchedule, bracket, standings »\nWorld Series odds, LDS preview »\nOur predictions for every round »\nPham: \"He was raised by a good family. You can obviously see that ... He's a little shy but I'll try to joke with him in the outfield when there's a pitching change. I'll say things like, 'Hey Corbin, I think that girl really likes you in the outfield stands.' Then I'll tell him, 'When I was your age I was a little faster than you.' I tell him stuff like that, [trying] to get a smile out of him.\"\nThomas: \"We play video games. That's the one thing I'm better than him at. He gets so mad whenever I beat him. We go at it in Fortnite.\"\nThe big stage\nThe Diamondbacks started the playoffs by first rolling into Milwaukee for a wild-card sweep of the Brewers that included two comeback victories, earning the team the nickname of \"The Answerbacks,\" and then handing Clayton Kershaw the worst start of his entire career in their National League Division Series-opening win. Carroll has been at the center of it all, posting an incredible .500/.571/1.083 slash line while providing his first signature October moment -- and leaving his teammates wondering where this postseason ride will go next. \nThomas: \"You want a moment? How about hitting that changeup 450 feet in [NL wild card] Game 1? That was a defining moment for the series because we were down.\"\nLongoria: \"The national viewership deserves to see a player like him in big moments like this.\""}
{"title": "Why Dodgers' pitching blueprint won't change -- even after Kershaw's Game 1 disaster", "date": "2023-10-09 12:34:08", "text": "Clayton Kershaw reacts to a rough Game 1 in which he could not get out of the first inning against the Diamondbacks. (0:26)\nLOS ANGELES -- The circumstances yearned for reassessment, but Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't entertain it. Clayton Kershaw had put together the worst start of his illustrious career, on the heels of a two-month stretch in which he was clearly limited by a balky left shoulder, but Roberts didn't deviate from his plan.\nKershaw, Roberts said Saturday night, then reiterated again Sunday morning, will make his next scheduled start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Game 4 on Thursday, if this National League Division Series even gets there.\n\"For us to accomplish what we want to this year,\" Roberts said, \"we're going to need Clayton Kershaw to start baseball games.\"\nAnd therein lies the vulnerability of these Dodgers, a 100-win team that is far from a juggernaut because of the uncertainty throughout its starting rotation.\nThe Dodgers went into this postseason looking to make up for a glaring deficiency with unconventionality, utilizing openers and bridge starters and a heavy dose of high-leverage relievers to piece together victories in October. It's a volatile plan born out of necessity, but its success hinged on Kershaw providing four to five quality innings on his start days. It's why the results of his Game 1 outing Saturday night -- six runs allowed and one out recorded, becoming only the fourth starting pitcher in postseason history with such a line -- were so concerning.\nKershaw is the only man remaining from the Dodgers' initial rotation of the season. Dustin May and Tony Gonsolin underwent season-ending surgeries; Noah Syndergaard struggled mightily before being traded away; Walker Buehler didn't make it back from his second Tommy John surgery in time to help; Julio Urias went on administrative leave after allegations of domestic violence; and midseason pursuits of Justin Verlander and Eduardo Rodriguez fell through.\nThe Dodgers knew Kershaw would be limited in the postseason, but they expected him to be effective. Upon his return from a six-week stint on the injured list in early August, they spaced out Kershaw's starts and shortened them to about five innings at a time. He delivered under those constraints, posting an ERA under 3.00 despite a fastball that was mostly clocked around 88 mph.\nThat, the Dodgers thought, would be enough for a pitching staff that would ask a lot out of a foursome of rookies that includes Bobby Miller, Ryan Pepiot, Emmet Sheehan and Michael Grove.\nNow the Dodgers don't know what to expect from their most accomplished pitcher.\nWe've got you covered on all things October baseball.\nSchedule, bracket, standings »\nWorld Series odds, LDS preview »\nOur predictions for every round »\nKershaw emphasized Saturday that his Game 1 struggles were not health related. \"Just bad pitching,\" he said. Roberts noted that Kershaw's stuff was relatively sharp; all 17 of Kershaw's fastballs were 90 to 91 mph. It's a source of optimism, but also, considering the damage levied against him by an exceedingly aggressive offense, a reason to worry.\n\"I think that's fair,\" Roberts said when asked if it's more concerning that Kershaw struggled despite an uptick in velocity. \"I would still bet on the stuff being good than the stuff being down and not sharp. So now it's how we attack these guys. It's a game of adjustments. It really is. I still stand by the fact that he's healthy. The stuff played up, and now we've just got to make better pitches.\"\nThe Dodgers have been as celebrated for their regular-season prowess as they have been chastised for their postseason shortcomings, most notably their division series exits at the hands of the Washington Nationals in 2019 and the San Diego Padres in 2022. Despite their standing as one of this era's most successful franchises, they have been panned for frequently falling short of expectations in October, a label that has followed Kershaw for most of his career. But the circumstances are vastly different now. The Dodgers are noticeably shorthanded, and Kershaw, 35, is seemingly not right.\nA longtime scout who watched Kershaw pitch frequently down the stretch said his stuff was \"about a third down\" over the last two months of the regular season. The metrics support that. Stuff+ grades the physical characteristics of pitches by factoring velocity, spin rate, movement and release point, among other aspects, with 100 being league average. Kershaw's Stuff+ from 2021 to 2022 was 110. From April to July of this season, it was 108. From August to September, it was all the way down to 83. In other words, 17% below league average.\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nOn Saturday, he combined that with center-cut fastballs and an inadequate feel for his breaking pitches.\nSaid the scout: \"Diminished stuff with poor location is a bad combo.\"\nMiller, the 24-year-old right-hander with electric stuff but no prior postseason experience, will take the ball opposite Cy Young contender Zac Gallen in Game 2 from Dodger Stadium on Monday night. Roberts said he \"couldn't even sit here and tell you what Game 3 looks like,\" though Pepiot and Lance Lynn tag-teaming two-thirds of it stands out as a possibility.\nAfter that, if the Dodgers win at least once, it'll swing back to Kershaw.\nThey don't have much choice.\n\"There's certain people that get you here that have to get you across the finish line,\" Roberts said, \"and this is his role on our ballclub.\""}
{"title": "European review: Barca salvage draw in thriller, Arsenal edge Man City", "date": "2023-10-09 15:02:14", "text": "Bryan Zaragoza paces Granada early with a brace, but Barcelona evens the game late on goals by Lamine Yamal and Sergi Roberto. (1:42)\nAnother weekend of European football has come and gone. If you merely checked the box scores, you'd think there were few surprises as the weekend's action got underway, but those full-time figures tell only half the story.\nOn Saturday in the Premier League, Manchester United won, although you wouldn't know it if you walked out of Old Trafford in the 92nd minute, and so did Chelsea, they themselves coming from behind, too. Borussia Dortmund also overturned a deficit to seal a win whose scoreline belies the struggle last year's Bundesliga runners-up faced. Elsewhere, the world was reminded of Jude Bellingham's seemingly limitless potential as he kept Real Madrid on top of LaLiga.\nOn Sunday, Arsenal ended their losing streak against Man City with a late goal from Gabriel Martinelli, while Liverpool and Brighton shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw. In Germany, Bayern Munich won comfortably over Freiburg but sit in third place behind Stuttgart and Leverkusen. Meanwhile, Barcelona salvaged a draw against Granada after going 2-0 down, and PSG clinched a much-needed win against Rennes.\nHere is your look back at all the fun from the weekend.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\nSergi Roberto's late goal rescued Barcelona a point at Granada on Sunday as they came from two down to draw 2-2 at the Nuevo Los Cármenes in a game packed with incident.\nBryan Zaragoza, the league's smallest player at 5-foot-3, opened the scoring after just 17 seconds (the quickest goal Barça have ever conceded in LaLiga). The diminutive forward then added a brilliant second, turning Jules Koundé inside out in the 29th minute to leave Xavi Hernandez's side with a mountain to climb in the shadows of the Sierra Nevada.\nThe comeback began with a piece of history when Lamine Yamal turned home from close range to become the youngest goal scorer in LaLiga at 16 years and 87 days old. Roberto then came off the bench to equalise in the 85th minute, but the drama did not end there. There was still time for Zaragoza, on a hat-trick, to smash the post and Barça to have a stoppage-time goal ruled out. João Félix, who thought he had netted the winner, was not offside, but Ferran Torres, who had attempted to play the ball before him, was.\nThe draw leaves Granada in the relegation zone and sees Barça slip to third in the table, three points behind Real Madrid and one back from Girona. That gap will not worry Xavi at this stage of the season, but problems are mounting with the first clásico of the season on the horizon at the end of October.\nInjuries are continuing to pile up. Kounde was withdrawn here in the first half. He joins Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski on the treatment table. However, it's Barça's defensive issues which Xavi will look to fix during the international break. They have now conceded 10 goals in LaLiga this season through nine games -- it took them 31 matches to concede that amount last season.\nThe ease with which they leak goals keeps leaving them in compromising positions. They recovered from 2-0 down to beat Celta Vigo 3-2 and twice came back to draw 2-2 at Mallorca recently. Granada can now be added to their list of comebacks, but opposition such as Athletic Bilbao and Madrid, their next two league games, may not be so forgiving. -- Sam Marsden\nArsenal ended their 12-game losing streak against Manchester City and signalled their readiness to end a 20-year Premier League title drought after Nathan Aké's late own goal sealed a deserved win for the Gunners.\nGabriel Martinelli's shot from the edge of the penalty area, following a lay-off by Kai Havertz, beat City keeper Éderson after taking a heavy deflection off Ake's head in the 86th minute to not only give Arsenal the major psychological boost of beating Pep Guardiola's team but also inflict City's second successive league defeat.\nJanusz Michallik slams Pep Guardiola's tactical decisions in Manchester City's 1-0 loss vs. Arsenal.\nHaving been forced to face City without injured talisman Bukayo Saka, Arsenal then had to overcome the first-half failure of referee Michael Oliver to send off Mateo Kovacic following a late challenge on Martin Odegaard which, despite being reviewed by VAR, did not lead to a red card for the former Chelsea player. Kovacic was then spared a second yellow card -- and dismissal -- six minutes later when Oliver failed to take action following another bad tackle on Declan Rice.\nBut despite City avoiding the loss of a key player to a red card, Arsenal put the sense of injustice behind them and held firm in a mature and confident performance. Last season, City twice beat the Gunners convincingly before going on to win the title, but Mikel Arteta's side avoided the same fate this time around and was able to make the breakthrough for a crucial win when Martinelli's shot beat Ederson thanks to Ake's deflection.\nThe victory moves Arsenal joint top with North London rivals Tottenham with the two clubs now the only unbeaten teams in the Premier League. -- Mark Ogden\nConceding the game's first goal is becoming less of a habit for this Liverpool team and more of an addiction. Simon Adingra's opening goal for Brighton was the seventh time in Liverpool's 11 matches so far this season in which they've gone behind.\nLiverpool revel in a comeback victory, though, and shortly after the celebrations from the home fans died down it became clear that all Adingra's goal had done was wake Jurgen Klopp's team out of its stupor. Mohamed Salah's two goals in the space of six minutes gave Liverpool an unlikely lead heading into the half. The intensity of the action that followed in the second half was all the more impressive when you consider that both teams, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, were in action in the Europa League on Thursday night.\nJanusz Michallik explains why he was disappointed with Liverpool in their 2-2 draw with Brighton.\nRyan Gravenberch should have put the game beyond Brighton in the 54th minute when he inexplicably rattled the crossbar from close range with the goal gaping in front of him. While Lewis Dunk's equaliser 12 minutes from time felt as if it might set up a grandstand finish on the south coast, in the end a draw was perhaps a fair result.\nAfter last week's VAR furore over Luis Díaz's disallowed goal against Tottenham, the video assistant referee, Christopher Kavanagh, would have been praying for a quiet afternoon, but he managed to draw the ire of both teams during the 90 minutes.\nFirst, he elected not to recommend a red card for Pascal Gross as well as a penalty for hauling down Dominik Szoboszlai as last man. Second, he did not consider Virgil Van Dijk's second-half handball worthy of a penalty for De Zerbi's team -- a decision that caused the Brighton fans to reference Klopp's midweek comments in the chant, \"We want a replay.\" -- Tom Chambers\nGames between Bayern Munich and SC Freiburg are proof that history can indeed repeat itself. Since 1993, Bayern have never lost to Freiburg at home. The 3-0 win on Sunday was their 22nd home victory over Freiburg out of 25 games and simply another example of how helpless Freiburg usually are when they travel to the Bavarian capital.\nLeroy Sané put on a star performance, as the 27-year-old not only scored the second goal but also was omnipresent in the final third. Boss Thomas Tuchel decided to use Harry Kane in a familiar role, with the England captain frequently dropping back into the midfield and exploring opportunities to find Sané behind Freiburg's back line. A similar tactical setup worked beautifully against Manchester United in the Champions League a few weeks ago and also did the trick on Sunday.\nKingsley Coman scores two, and Leroy Sane provides another as Bayern Munich get the 3-0 win over SC Freiburg.\nGranted, Bayern benefited from what appeared to be a fluke goal by Kingsley Coman in the 12th minute, with the French winger seemingly attempting a high cross that ended up hitting the inside of the back post. The goal broke the deadlock for Bayern and gave the critics of Noah Atubolu, Freiburg's starting goalkeeper this season, new fodder.\nWhile they conceded the first goal in unlucky fashion, Freiburg did not look like a side playing to win. In the absence of Matthias Ginter, who is undoubtedly their outstanding defender, and amid a lack of urgency in pressing, Freiburg were overwhelmed by Bayern's dominance in ball possession. Whether it was Kane chipping the ball to Sané, Thomas Müller making one of his trademark runs inside the penalty area or Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies running at defenders at full speed, Bayern found enough ways to outplay their opponents.\nIf there is anything Tuchel has to worry about currently, it is his diminished group of defenders. With Matthijs de Ligt being out due to an injury, Dayot Upamecano and Kim Min-Jae are the only two remaining high-level centre-backs in Bayern's squad. Attrition did not hurt Bayern on Sunday, though at some point it very well could. -- Constantin Eckner\nAfter some tough and tense days following the disappointing goalless draw last weekend at Clermont and more importantly the heavy defeat in Newcastle in the Champions League on Wednesday night (4-1), Paris were under pressure for their trip to Rennes on Sunday night. Another loss and the crisis would be big. They needed to win and ideally with style. That's exactly what they did.\nEven if Rennes created the first chances, the Ligue 1 champions were efficient, solid, convincing, thrilling in their passing and brave too. Despite the hosts' intensity and pressing, the Parisians won comprehensively. And maybe the biggest lesson for this victory is who led the team to it. It wasn't Kylian Mbappé. It wasn't Ousmane Dembélé on his return to his old club. It was Vitinha, the same Vitinha who was dropped to the bench by manager Luis Enrique for the trip to Newcastle.\nPSG are now third in the table, one point behind Nice and two behind the league leaders Monaco after eight league games. With this win, they also bought themselves a bit of peace and quiet for the next few days. -- Julien Laurens\nAC Milan plan to sell Olivier Giroud goalkeeper jerseys after the striker's heroics in goal in their 1-0 win against Genoa. Giroud was forced to go in goal after Mike Maignan was sent off and Milan had no more substitutions. Milan said in a statement: \"The Club has decided to honour his performance in its last line of defence by putting him in the list of goalkeepers. Additionally, fans can now purchase the goalkeeper jersey and customize it with 'Giroud 9.'\"\nWayne Rooney has resigned as D.C. United head coach after the team was eliminated from MLS playoff contention. D.C. lost 2-0 to NYCFC at home in its final game of the regular season, with the team announcing immediately after the game that it had parted ways with Rooney, who previously spent 18 months as a player with D.C. and rejoined the club as head coach in July 2022.\nArsenal's Bukayo Saka will miss England duty to recover from injury. The 22-year-old suffered a hamstring strain in the Gunners' Champions League defeat to Lens and was unavailable for their win against Man City on Sunday. Mikel Arteta said: \"No, he cannot make it. He hasn't had a single training session so he will be out. He's not available to play football at the moment.\"\nBarcelona's Lamine Yamal became the youngest goal scorer in LaLiga history after finding the net against Granada. At 16 years and 87 days old, Yamal beat the previous record by less than two weeks. The Spain international has broke through this season under Xavi Hernandez, and all eyes are on the young winger to continue to make history.\n16-year-old Lamine Yamal tallies an easy goal and becomes the youngest scorer in LaLiga history.\n\nMissed the action on Saturday? Keep reading for all the talking points.\nIt's 10 out of 10 for Jude Bellingham: 10 goals in 10 Real Madrid games, the latest coming in a brace in Saturday's 4-0 win over Osasuna. Bellingham has been playing as a No. 10, too, even if he wears the No. 5.\nHis goal scoring just won't stop and neither will the comparisons. First it was Zinedine Zidane. Then it was Alfredo di Stefano. You hear choruses of \"Hey Jude\" every week at the Santiago Bernabeu. There are Bellingham shirts everywhere you look. Children imitate his arms-out-wide goal celebration. The fans couldn't love him more.\nBellingham's first goal against Osasuna came in the ninth minute after nice work from Luka Modric -- back in the team and proving his worth, with more touches and completed passes than any other player -- and then Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Carvajal. His second, to end the contest in the 54th minute, was the product of a one-two with Federico Valverde, before finishing through the legs of goalkeeper Sergio Herrera. His role in Madrid's third was limited to picking up Valverde, who had created the goal with a clever through ball for Vinicius Junior, to carry the Uruguayan player into the middle of the celebrations, ensuring that he got his share of the credit.\nAfter forward Joselu made it 4-0, Bellingham was quickly substituted. The stadium stood to applaud. They know they're witnessing something very special: a star is born. -- Alex Kirkland\nChelsea's trip to Burnley started similarly to so many of their games this Premier League season. The visitors looked bright in fits and starts, but that promise counted for little after just 15 minutes when Lyle Foster ran around both Axel Disasi and Thiago Silva to set up Wilson Odobert, whose stutter step befuddled Marc Cucurella and finish eluded Robert Sánchez.\nConsidering the growing pains the Blues have endured this season, it would've been easy for heads to drop. This was a starting XI whose average age was 24.6 and who'd averaged just 32 appearances for Chelsea. If you remove the 39-year-old Thiago Silva from the equation, the average age drops to 23.2 and the average appearances for the west London club falls to a mere 22.8.\nThis is an inexperienced team short on leadership. On this day, though, there was one player experienced enough to refuse to accept defeat.\nNo one on the pitch bettered Raheem Sterling's nine progressive carries (which advance the ball greater than five metres toward goal in the opposition half), only Enzo Fernández completed more passes in the attacking third than his 14, and no one registered more shots (three) or shots on target (two) than the 28-year-old England international. He was instrumental in every single one of Chelsea's goals as they beat Burnley 4-1.\nHis 42nd-minute cross was deflected into the hosts' goal to level the score, he won the penalty for Cole Palmer to give the Blues the lead from the spot, his 65th-minute strike gave his side some breathing room and his pacy run down the left flank ultimately resulted in Nicolas Jackson scoring the final goal of the match. These were just rewards for a player who should be the role model for a team full of immensely talented 20-somethings whose potentials are yet to be fulfilled.\nSteve Nicol credits Raheem Sterling's performance in Chelsea's win over Burnley to being dropped by England boss Gareth Southgate.\nFrom his breakout at Liverpool to his big-money move to Manchester City, Sterling has felt the pressure that weighs on the shoulders of young players on big wages with even bigger expectations. Chelsea will need to rely on his experience and his leadership if they're to regain their status among English football's elite. -- Austin Lindberg\nIt's far from a rarity; seeing black armbands wrapped around the biceps of the two teams on the pitch, a moment's silence before kickoff something of a growing routine across football. Often, it's for a former player from the men's side, someone from generations past who had had a good innings, left to be survived by children and grandchildren.\nNot so often are we asked to pause and celebrate a shorter life of a player who had been active until their passing.\nEven with the context of the rapid recent growth of the women's game following the past two World Cups that have driven record attendances, increased participation and vast investment, many corners of women's football still feel small and familial.\nNo, Maddy Cusack wasn't a household name in women's football, most of her career spent in the second tier of the English game, but she had shared pitches with many of the players across the top two divisions. Fans of other teams up and down the country had likely spent an afternoon or evening unwittingly watching the midfielder play as they took in their 90 minutes of live entertainment over a weekend. She had been part of the landscape of the game, a piece of the expansive puzzle, that had mixed and blurred with the others but became all too easy to spot once lost.\nBefore the opening game of the Women's Super League season, two of her former managers stood on the touchline, former teammates on the pitch at one of her former clubs. Even with the increased attendance, there were still those Villa ultras who had been there back when the Midlands club was in WSL 2 (as the Championship was known at the time), drawing home crowds of between 200 and 400 fans. Those were the fans who could remember Cusack's teen years spent in claret and blue after her move from Nottingham Forest.\nFrom Villa to crosstown rivals Birmingham City to Leicester City and on to Sheffield United, where the midfielder spent the last four years of her life, moving around the growing women's football bubble. But it was still just that, a bubble, one that had unexpectedly been put into mourning last month by the news of Cusack's death, and so the minutes of silence and applause began, to honour the life of the 27-year-old.\nWith the men's team at Sheffield United having paid their tributes to the midfielder, who paired her playing with a job as a marketing exec at the Blades' foundation, it was time for Cusack's team to say one last goodbye at Bramall Lane. Their fixture against London City Lionesses was brought forward a day so that some of her former teammates could attend the Championship clash and pay their respects to the friend they had lost.\nFrom the tribute video before kickoff to the two rounds of applause -- before the match and during the eighth minute, for the number she wore on the back of her shirt -- there was an unmistakable sombre hue over the game. Those on the pitch shifting focus to the task at hand as so many players around the world do once the whistle has sounded, football the familiar escapism. The result -- a much-needed 3-1 win -- was the story for the football pages but left as a footnote as the club continued its grieving process. -- Lawson\nManager Erik ten Hag said after Manchester United's dramatic 2-1 come-from-behind win over Brentford that he sent on Scott McTominay as a late substitute and said \"score two goals.\" Those instructions worked like a charm.\nSteve Nicol isn't convinced by Manchester United's late comeback win over Brentford in the Premier League.\nMcTominay has had to be patient at Old Trafford this season, starting just two games in all competitions, but this was a timely reminder of what he can contribute to a team clearly struggling. The Scotland international is one of the top scorers in Euro 2024 qualifying, was wanted by Bayern Munich in the summer and is surely deserving of an opportunity in a stuttering United team.\nCasemiro was one of those at fault for Brentford's goal and was substituted at half-time. Summer signing Sofyan Amrabat looks like he's still trying to get to grips with the pace of the Premier League and Mason Mount has so far done little to justify his £60 million transfer fee from Chelsea.\nMcTominay might not be a Ten Hag favourite, but his favourites aren't working and, injury permitting, the 26-year-old should be in the team when United resume after the international break with a trip to Sheffield United. Except perhaps 20-year-old striker Rasmus Højlund, no one in the squad can say they are playing well enough to justify automatic selection and McTominay's late heroics against Brentford should be enough to guarantee at least a chance. -- Rob Dawson\nIn what was just their second match of the season, Arsenal were already facing the prospect of a must-win against Manchester United after their opening-day defeat at home to Liverpool. Indeed, a loss would have been their fourth straight, spanning back to last season, marking a new club record. The prospect was a tricky one, though, facing a team they had failed to beat in their past five meetings across both league and cup.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Melvine Malard's deft strike -- again, something of a gift from the Gunners' regrettable defending -- looked to have won it for the hosts, but just as stoppage time gave(th) to United last week, it took(eth) away on Friday night as Cloe Lacasse fired a rocket into the narrow gap between the apex of the woodwork and Mary Earps's outstretched paw. The scoreline read 2-2 when the full-time whistle went.\nIt had been a game of errors from both sides, as well as flashes of quality from top to bottom, with the new attacking additions continuing to ink their names into the memory. Maybe not quite the game of margins many were expecting, Arsenal, for all their chances, again failing to really capitalise when they went forward -- uncomfortable déjà vu for the Gunners. United still growing with a promise of the football to come, Brazilian international Geyse already making fans around the country take notice.\nIn his post-match comments, United boss Marc Skinner impressed the importance of time together for his players, of what is yet to come when everyone is up to speed and well-versed in his style. There is a similar sense among their opposition too, the visitors had their fair share of chances and Alessia Russo easily could have followed the narrative and scored against her former club on a night when her every touch brought about a chorus of boos from around the stadium.\nAs it is, less than 36 hours after announcing a new deal for manager Jonas Eidevall, the Arsenal coach has his first point of the season, even if it wasn't the most convincing. -- Lawson\nErik ten Hag hit out at his Manchester United players after the dramatic 2-1 win over Brentford telling his squad \"if you can't handle the pressure, don't play here.\" United needed two stoppage-time goals from substitute Scott McTominay to avoid a third successive defeat at Old Trafford. Afterward, Ten Hag said his team had been \"eaten\" by Brentford in the first half and urged his players to be more \"determined.\"\nVinicius Junior praised Jude Bellingham as \"incredible\" and said the midfielder \"was born to play for Real Madrid\" after the England international scored twice in the club's 4-0 LaLiga win over Osasuna on Saturday. \"Bellingham is giving us a lot of possibilities up front,\" coach Carlo Ancelotti said in his postmatch news conference. \"He's involved in the play, and not having a fixed position gives him an advantage.

Nobody expected this level in terms of goals.\"\nAS Roma coach José Mourinho said he fully expects to work in Saudi Arabia one day after his compatriot, Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, led the way by joining Al Nassr, with a stream of players subsequently signing for Saudi Pro League teams. \"I will go to Saudi Arabia in some free time, but I am convinced that I will work there. I don't know when, but I am pretty sure of it,\" said Mourinho, who is under pressure after a disappointing start to the season. \"No one knows the future, but I will definitely [work in Saudi Arabia].\"\nIt was a crazy end to Genoa vs. AC Milan as the Rossoneri snatched a late 1-0 win thanks to Christian Pulisic's strike after 87 minutes of a scoreless stalemate.\n87': Christian Pulisic gives Milan the lead ⚽90+8': Mike Maignan gets sent off 🟥90+9': Olivier Giroud goes in goal for Milan 🧤90+13': Josep Martinez gets sent off 🟥A frantic finish to Milan's game vs. Genoa 😅 pic.twitter.com/9ETXoJLq4D\nHowever, late into stoppage time, goalkeeper Mike Maignan was sent off after bringing down Caleb Ekuban due to serious foul play outside the edge of the box.

{"title": "Why Arsenal, Man United are struggling with new goalkeepers Raya, Onana", "date": "2023-10-09 15:02:14", "text": "Mark Ogden explains the difficulty for Arsenal's defenders in moving from Aaron Ramsdale to David Raya in goal. (1:32)\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta felt compelled to defend goalkeeper David Raya after the Gunners ended their 12-game losing streak against Manchester City to defeat the Premier League champions 1-0 on Sunday. \"I think he was excellent,\" Arteta said. \"The way he controlled the ball, how dominant he was and how high he played. I love players with courage.\"\nArteta has made a big call over the Brentford loanee this season, choosing to replace previous No. 1 Aaron Ramsdale -- a significant figure in Arsenal's title challenge last term -- in favour of a different kind of player. Raya is the ultimate modern goalkeeper: comfortable with the ball at his feet and capable of adding a new attacking dimension to the team.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag is attempting to make a similar transition, with André Onana arriving from Inter Milan to replace David de Gea this summer. But while ball-playing goalkeepers have been transformative at Manchester City and Liverpool in the Premier League -- Éderson and Alisson Becker have been crucial to their clubs' respective successes -- switching from a traditional 'keeper to a more-rounded footballer in goal is not a quick fix. Both Raya and Onana have found themselves in the eye of a storm at their new clubs already.\nIn the game against City, former Manchester United defender Gary Neville described Raya as a \"nervous wreck\" during his commentary of the game for Sky Sports. Meanwhile, the Arsenal supporters inside the stadium made their agitation clear whenever the 'keeper had the ball at his feet by raising the volume level with shouts of \"Get rid of it,\" \"What are you doing?\" and several expletive-laden expressions of alarm.\nHaving almost conceded a first-half goal when his clearance was blocked by an onrushing Julián Álvarez inside the six-yard box, Raya set the tone for a difficult afternoon in which his presence in the Arsenal goal, ahead of fans' favourite Ramsdale, was once again a major talking point.\nWith 19 goals in 10 games conceded so far, Onana's start to life at United is prompting similar levels of scrutiny. Not only because the Cameroon international has made a number of high-profile mistakes leading to goals, but also because he has taken the place of De Gea who, despite an error-ridden final season at Old Trafford last year, continues to be regarded with affection by many United supporters following his departure at the end of his contract in June.\nRaya and Onana are both highly rated goalkeepers. Raya has been one of the most consistent in the Premier League over the past two seasons for Brentford; Onana enjoyed success at Ajax and Inter before being identified as De Gea's replacement by Ten Hag.\nCrucially, Raya and Onana have the absolute backing of their managers, with both Arteta and Ten Hag wanting a goalkeeper who can give their team greater control of the ball. In turn, that means they can set up to defend higher up the pitch and look to the goalkeeper to beat an opponent's attacking press with pinpoint distribution from long and short passes.\nThat is the ideal scenario, which has been delivered by both Ederson and Alisson for their clubs, but even those two have had their meltdowns, when they have been overconfident on the ball or too keen to race out of the penalty area to try to snuff out an attack.\nWhen Pep Guardiola took charge at City in the summer of 2016, his first decision was to replace title-winning goalkeeper Joe Hart, who was England's No. 1 at the time, with Barcelona's Claudio Bravo. Guardiola wanted to oversee the same transition that Arteta and Ten Hag are attempting now, but City weren't ready for the change. Bravo often exposed the deficiencies in defence by playing his teammates into trouble with risky passes in dangerous areas or sparking confusion with his positioning in the defensive third.\nNow, City's defenders are totally comfortable when Ederson does anything similar because Guardiola has assembled a squad of players who can play with a ball-playing goalkeeper. And they have had over seven years of practice with someone like that behind them.\nRaya only arrived at the Emirates in mid-August and did not make his debut until mid-September, so the opportunity for the keeper and his defenders to familiarise themselves with each other has been minimal. And it shows. Arsenal do have defenders who are good enough on the ball to adjust to having Raya behind them, rather than Ramsdale, but it will take time.\nOnana has a different problem at United in that the majority of his defenders aren't comfortable on the ball. When Onana passes to the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot or Victor Lindelöf, he is giving the ball to players who don't want to receive it in the defensive third of the pitch. Having had De Gea in goal for the past decade, United's players have grown accustomed to a keeper who rarely left his penalty area, so Onana's confidence in rushing out it is another issue they have to take into consideration.\nThe secret to success with a ball-playing goalkeeper is having defenders who are supremely confident and comfortable on the ball. Arsenal have the players to make it work; United arguably don't. But the reality for both teams, and any other club that wants to try it, is that it takes effort from more than just the goalkeeper for it to reap rewards."}

Green with his 24th career receiving TD for Georgia. (0:55)\nWhile Oklahoma's thrilling victory over Texas in the Red River Rivalry captured the nation's attention, Georgia, Michigan, Florida State and Ohio State were reminding the college football world they're still here.\nAll won in reasonably easy fashion -- Ohio State struggled early -- to secure their spots in our power rankings. While Texas' loss dropped the Longhorns from last week's No. 3 spot, it's Notre Dame that took a big tumble with the loss to unbeaten Louisville.\nNext week should see another shakeup when the high-powered offenses of Oregon and Washington collide in a huge Pac-12 matchup in Seattle (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC).\nHere's how the Power Rankings play out after Week 6 results:\nSo maybe the Bulldogs are going to be just fine. Say what you want about Kentucky, but beating the undefeated Wildcats 51-13 felt like a statement for Georgia. On offense, Carson Beck tied a career high with three touchdown passes ... in the first half. And All-American tight end Brock Bowers eclipsed the 100-yard receiving mark for a third consecutive game. Meanwhile, the defense flexed its muscles by taking running back Ray Davis, who rushed for 280 yards his last time out against Florida, and held him in check to the tune of 59 yards and no touchdowns rushing. -- Alex Scarborough\nUp next: at Vanderbilt (noon ET)\nThe Wolverines' offense continued its string of strong games in a big 52-10 win over Minnesota. The Wolverines have scored 30 or more points in nine straight games going back to last season, which is the longest streak in program history. Quarterback J.J. McCarthy threw for over 200 yards with a touchdown through the air and added two rushing touchdowns. The Wolverines' defense contributed to the scoring as well, with two interceptions returned for touchdowns. It's the first time Michigan had two defensive scores on the road since 2006 against Notre Dame. This is a balanced team that is playing at a very high level through the first six games. -- Tom VanHaaren\nUp next: vs. Indiana (noon ET)\nThe open date following the dramatic win in Death Valley two weeks ago didn't seem to impact Jordan Travis and the Seminoles much as they collectively took care of business against Virginia Tech 39-17. Travis was efficient, completing 18 of 24 passes for 170 yards and two TDs -- both to Johnny Wilson, who left in the third quarter with an injury and didn't return. Florida State led 22-0 after the first quarter but saw the Hokies score the next 17, including on a 99-yard kickoff return to start the second half. But the Seminoles responded as Trey Benson had touchdown runs of 62 and 85 yards in the second half to punctuate a career-high 200-yard rushing performance. With the Clemson test now passed and the team 5-0 for the first time since 2015, it's all about getting ready for Duke (Oct. 21) and trying not to look ahead to Miami (Nov. 11) as the program looks to win its first ACC title since 2014. -- Blake Baumgartner\nUp next: vs. Syracuse\nThe gutsy, game-winning drive against Notre Dame that fired up Ryan Day and the Buckeyes wasn't the catalyst they hoped it would be. Ohio State looked sluggish after an open week, especially on offense without top rusher TreVeyon Henderson, and was fortunate to be tied 10-10 with Maryland at halftime after the Terrapins had the clock run out while in field goal range. The struggles continued after halftime, but Ohio State responded from a 17-10 deficit to score the game's final 27 points. Despite only 62 rushing yards for the team, quarterback Kyle McCord and his receivers gashed Maryland's defense in the final 26 minutes. McCord finished with a career-high 320 pass yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions, and the defense generated enough big plays from Josh Proctor, JT Tuimoloau and others. Ohio State will need to play more complete games, especially with Penn State visiting Oct. 21. -- Adam Rittenberg\nUp next: at Purdue (noon ET)\nA year after a humiliating 49-0 loss to Texas, the Sooners found some of their old magic, battling the Longhorns all game and letting a lead slip away before Dillon Gabriel put together a drive for the ages. He accounted for all 61 of Oklahoma's yards on the game-winning TD drive, including going 4-for-4 with 58 passing yards and stepping up into a pass rush to find Nic Anderson in the back of the end zone for the touchdown. The Sooners, who went 0-5 in one-score games last year, made a statement with three forced turnovers and an upset of the No. 3 Longhorns. The Sooners suddenly can see shades of 2000, when OU coach Brent Venables was a young assistant on an upstart team that made a run to the national championship. It's only six games, but the hope is back in Norman. -- Dave Wilson\nUp next: vs. UCF, Oct. 21\nThe Huskies had the week off ahead of next week's highly anticipated showdown against Oregon in Seattle. For USC, the winner of that game will be the de facto team to beat in the Pac-12 at the halfway mark of the season. The game also could be a springboard for Michael Penix Jr.'s Heisman campaign, which is off to a terrific start, but without a true marquee victory it's only ramping up. If he outduels Oregon QB Bo Nix, Penix could make believers out of those who might not have been paying close attention. -- Kyle Bonagura\nUp next: vs. Oregon (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC)\nThe Ducks have opted to use their first five games of the season to show just how much of a juggernaut they can be. Oregon has averaged over 51 points and held opponents to just under 12 points per contest. The dominant start hit a pause button this week with a bye, but what awaits the Ducks next week is an opponent befitting their potential. Washington is unbeaten, also coming off a bye and with a similar level of dominance in its previous stretch -- 46 points per game. Dan Lanning's team will have its hands full with Heisman contender Michael Penix Jr. and the potent Huskies offense in a matchup of top-10 teams with playoff aspirations. -- Paolo Uggetti\nUp next: at Washington (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC)\nA gifted Nittany Lions team led by one of the nation's best defenses recognizes its season likely will come down to two games: Ohio State (Oct. 21, road) and Michigan (Nov. 11, home). After a strong second half against Northwestern, Penn State had an open week to rest up before an Ohio State tuneup against UMass. The Nittany Lions are allowing just 9.6 points per game and 3.8 yards per play, while racking up 20 sacks, 37 tackles for loss, 6 interceptions and 6 forced fumbles. \"They know where we're ranked,\" defensive coordinator Manny Diaz told me. \"They know who's in our league, and that there are elite defenses in this league. So we can't sit around and act like we've got the market cornered because there's people coming up on our schedule that are side-by-side with us at the top of all these categories. So there's always more to do.\" Penn State wants a dominant and injury-free performance against UMass before gearing up for its trip to Ohio Stadium. -- Rittenberg\nUp next: vs. UMass (3:30 p.m. ET)\nWhen the Arizona Wildcats raced to a shocking 17-0 lead on a USC team that looked like it had just woken up, the game had all the makings of a classic Pac-12 After Dark upset. What's more: USC's defense had been bending the past few weeks, and Arizona looked determined to break it early on. It didn't help that quarterback Caleb Williams and the rest of the USC offense struggled to find any rhythm, but in the end despite their many flaws, the Trojans' talent won out. USC patched together a comeback of sorts, using bad Arizona penalties and a few stops to tie the game at 28. A botched kick to end regulation by USC kicker Denis Lynch pushed the game into overtime where, after three periods, USC escaped with a 43-41 win thanks to Williams' third rushing touchdown of the game. -- Uggetti\nUp next: at Notre Dame (7:30 p.m. ET, NBC/Peacock)\nThe Longhorns came out with some aggressive playcalling by Steve Sarkisian, including a fake punt that Jordan Whittington converted for a first down and a pass by wide receiver Savion Red on another fourth-down play, both on the same first-quarter drive, then blocked a punt for a touchdown. But down 27-20 in the fourth quarter, the Longhorns were stuffed on four straight plays from the 1 and came away with no points before rallying to take a 30-27 lead with 1:17 remaining. Then disaster struck: Oklahoma's Dillon Gabriel drove down the field in under a minute to toss a 3-yard TD pass to Nic Anderson with 15 seconds remaining and win it 34-30. It's a crushing loss for the Longhorns -- as all losses to Oklahoma are for Texas -- but there's a solid chance they'll get a rematch in the Big 12 title game in December if they can bounce back. \"I think this locker room is full of champions and our goal is to win a championship this year,\" Sarkisian said after the game. \"We've got to go handle our business.\" -- Wilson\nUp next: at Houston, Oct. 21\nUgly wins, especially on the road in the SEC, are never to be taken for granted. Alabama made enough mistakes to lose a couple of games Saturday, but made the plays that counted to hold off Texas A&M 26-20 at a raucous Kyle Field. Quarterback Jalen Milroe is starting to make more winning plays than bad plays and passed for 321 yards and three touchdowns against the Aggies. It was also a good sign for Alabama that receiver Jermaine Burton had a breakout game with nine catches for 197 yards and two touchdowns. The Tide needed a go-to receiver to emerge. The defense has been outstanding ever since the 34-24 loss to Texas, and the front seven was dominant at times and kept the pressure on Texas A&M quarterback Max Johnson. Alabama gets its next three games at home and heads into that stretch as the SEC West's only unbeaten team in league play. In other words, it's always premature to count out Nick Saban and the Tide. -- Chris Low\nUp next: vs. Arkansas (noon ET, ESPN)\nIt didn't take long for wide receiver Tez Walker (six receptions for 43 yards on eight targets) to get acclimated to the Tar Heels' offense after he was finally deemed eligible. He caught six passes for 43 yards in North Carolina's 40-7 win against Syracuse. Drake Maye and the Tar Heels offense was in perfect harmony from the jump. Maye picked Syracuse's defense apart, connecting with 10 receivers in the first half alone as the offense racked up 424 total yards, tied for the program's most in a half over the past four seasons. Nate McCollum led the way with seven receptions for 135 yards (103 in first half). Spurred on by Maye's precision (33-of-47 passing for 442 yards and three touchdowns), North Carolina finished with a season-high 644 total yards -- the third time it has surpassed 500 in a game this season -- while controlling the clock for 37:16. Maye's third career game with at least 400 passing yards has the program off to its best start since 1997, when it began 8-0. -- Baumgartner\nUp next: vs. Miami\nThe Cardinals used an aggressive game plan against Notre Dame quarterback Sam Hartman and it worked for the second straight year. Last year, Louisville forced him into six turnovers when he played at Wake Forest. This year, they forced him into three interceptions and sacked him five times in a 33-20 win that ended Notre Dame's record 30-game regular-season winning streak against the ACC. Jawhar Jordan rushed for 143 yards and two touchdowns and Louisville has now beaten AP Top 10 teams in consecutive seasons. The other one? That's right, Hartman's Wake Forest team. -- Andrea Adelson\nUp next: at Pitt (6:30 p.m. ET, CW Network)\nA week after winning a low-scoring slog against Utah, Oregon State responded by winning in a shootout against Cal 52-40. Quarterback DJ Uiagalelei completed 19 of 25 passes for 275 with five touchdowns and no interceptions. The Beavers piled up 499 yards of total offense in what was their most complete offensive showing of the season and comes ahead of an important test next week against one of the conference's best defenses in UCLA. Despite their loss to WSU, the Beavers should still be considered a conference-title contender in what is turning into a very interesting Pac-12 race. -- Bonagura \nUp next: vs. UCLA (8 p.m. ET)\nNormally, when you go three quarters without converting a third down, you've got problems. Normally, when your starting quarterback throws for only 153 yards, it spells trouble. But give the Rebs credit for finding a way to beat Arkansas when Jaxson Dart and the offense weren't clicking on all cylinders. They coughed up a 10-point lead and recaptured the momentum with a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter. But of course the real star of the show for Ole Miss was its defense, which held down the fort to the tune of 288 total yards allowed and only 1.2 yards per rush. Protecting a one-score lead with under two minutes to play, the secondary came up with its second interception of the night. With games against unranked Auburn, Vanderbilt and Texas A&M coming up, the Rebs have a chance to make some noise in the SEC. -- Scarborough\nUp next: at Auburn, Oct. 21\nWill quarterback Cameron Rising return against California after this week's open date? That's the only question that matters right now with the Utes' schedule about to get a whole lot tougher as a trip to Los Angeles to face USC and then a home date against Oregon in Salt Lake City close out their October slate. Utah ranks last in the Pac-12 both in total offense (297.6 YPG) and passing offense (153.8 YPG) and finding a way to jump-start things is a must for Kyle Whittingham's team to stay in a conference race that features three teams in the AP's top 10. The Utes' defense, allowing 11.8 PPG, has been asked to carry a lot of the load early, surrendering 13 or fewer points in three of their four games against Power 5 foes. That number is going to get severely tested if the offense doesn't get in gear soon. -- Baumgartner\nUp next: vs. Cal (3 p.m. ET)\nA resigned Jake Dickert had no choice but to call the UCLA defense the best in the conference after his team was stumped offensively on its way to a 25-17 loss -- its first of the season. The Cougars arrived at the Rose Bowl with another one of the Pac-12's (and the country's) best offenses, having averaged nearly 46 points per game through four contests this season. But while Cam Ward struggled to look anything like the player he had been in the previous four games, the entire Wazzu offense found no rhythm as it was forced into 4 fumbles, 2 interceptions and 9 punts. Dickert bemoaned how outmatched WSU was on the line of scrimmage, where UCLA's athletes dictated everything and controlled the game from start to finish. -- Uggetti\nUp next: vs. Arizona (7 p.m. ET)\nTennessee had Saturday off after an up-and-down early season. After a Week 3 loss to Florida, the Vols responded with comfortable home wins over UTSA and South Carolina. After riding to 11 wins with a high-flying passing attack in 2022, Tennessee has been Bizarro Tennessee this fall, winning with a dynamite run game and mostly strong defense. But the Vols will probably need some chunk plays from Joe Milton III & Co. if they're going to survive a three-game gauntlet through the rest of October. They host Texas A&M next Saturday, then travel to face Alabama and Kentucky. Can they shift into another gear? They'll need to. -- Bill Connelly\nUp next: vs. Texas A&M (3:30 p.m. ET)\nThe Blue Devils had a much-needed open date this week after not only a tough, last-minute loss to Notre Dame, but also an ankle injury to quarterback Riley Leonard that has him week-to-week. Duke has not been able to offer much more of a timeline than that because his return depends on how quickly Leonard responds to rehab. If he is unable to play next Saturday against NC State, redshirt freshman Henry Belin IV will get the start. -- Adelson\nUp next: vs. NC State (8 p.m. ET, ACC Network)\nThree straight physical games against ranked opponents proved to be too much for the Irish, who lost at Louisville 33-20, effectively ending their College Football Playoff hopes. Louisville was the aggressor all night, especially on defense, harassing Sam Hartman into multiple mistakes and slowing down the running game. Notre Dame had only 44 yards rushing as Audric Estime had 20 yards on 10 carries. Notre Dame was forced to throw more than it wanted to once Louisville took the lead in the third quarter, and simply could not get anything going. Hartman went 6-for-19 for 150 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions on passes thrown 10 or more yards downfield. -- Adelson\nUp next: vs. USC (7:30 p.m. ET, NBC/Peacock)\nIf there was any doubt the Bruins had the best defense in an offense-heavy Pac-12 this season, they showed it when they handed No. 13 Wazzu its first loss of the year. UCLA's menacing pass rush kept Cougs' quarterback Cam Ward on his back foot all day long as he threw two interceptions, and by the time the clock hit zero, the Bruins had held one of the best offenses in the country to 17 points and 216 total yards of offense. With a freshman quarterback in Dante Moore having growing pains (two interceptions Saturday), UCLA's defense has been the perfect complement, keeping the Bruins in games when Chip Kelly's offense struggles. After a one-score loss to Utah two weeks ago and a bye week, the Bruins are back on track and present a tough matchup for their upcoming opponents. -- Uggetti\nUp next: at Oregon State\nIt is hard to think of a loss as inexplicable as the one Miami just experienced. Needing just to kneel down to secure a win, Miami instead handed off and fumbled with 33 seconds left. Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King then led the Yellow Jackets on the game-winning drive, throwing a 44-yard touchdown pass to Christian Leary with 1 second left to stun the Hurricanes 23-20, ending Miami's unbeaten season. Miami turned the ball over five times -- quarterback Tyler Van Dyke threw three interceptions -- and lacked the type of cohesion and rhythm that it had before the open date. Next up is a road game at unbeaten North Carolina, so the Hurricanes will have to find a way to respond quickly. -- Adelson\nUp next: at North Carolina\nA 38-point loss on the road at Georgia stings, but it's not the end of the world for the 5-1 Wildcats. The key will be how they respond. On offense, quarterback Devin Leary has to find a way to complete better than 50% of his passes. And it might be time to find a complement to running back Ray Davis, who went from 280 yards against Florida to 59 yards against Georgia. The defense, meanwhile, has a lot of work to do, especially the secondary that was picked apart by Carson Beck in the first half. Missouri has a high-powered offense that will test Kentucky's resolve next week. -- Scarborough\nUp next: vs. Missouri\nIn the end, Jayden Daniels outplayed Brady Cook. That made the difference as LSU took down Missouri 49-39 in Columbia early Saturday. Cook threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns, and Mizzou bolted to an early 22-7 lead, but Daniels, with 259 passing yards, 130 rushing yards and 4 combined touchdowns, led a slow-but-steady comeback. His 29-yard strike to Malik Nabers with 2:58 left gave the second half its fifth and final lead change, and a late Major Burns pick-six sealed the deal. LSU's struggling defense gave up another 527 yards, but after scoring touchdowns on each of the first three drives, Mizzou managed just 17 points over its final 10. That was enough to flip the advantage in this track meet. -- Connelly\nUp next: vs. Auburn\nAfter three close wins helped to drive a 5-0 start, Mizzou ran afoul of the close-game gods. The Tigers led LSU most of the way but fell 49-39 after Malik Nabers' go-ahead touchdown with 2:58 left and a game-sealing Major Burns pick-six. Brady Cook threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns, Luther Burden III gained 149 yards on 11 catches and Cody Schrader had 114 yards on the ground. But Cook also threw his first two interceptions of the season, and the defense gave up 325 second-half yards. Mizzou couldn't make an early 22-7 lead hold up and fell to 5-1 because of it. But there's no time for moping: A trip to Kentucky, where Mizzou hasn't won since 2013, looms. -- Connelly\nUp next: at Kentucky"}
{"title": "Canelo Alvarez is fighting in May, but who should be his opponent?", "date": "2023-10-09 15:39:44", "text": "Canelo Alvarez remains the undisputed super middleweight champion after his third defense, a dominant decision win over Jermell Charlo last month in Las Vegas.\nBoxing's top star has competed twice at light heavyweight but appears settled in at 168 pounds, where his last three fights have occurred. At 33 years old, and with his Hall of Fame legacy secured, where does Alvarez go from here?\nESPN's No. 4 pound-for-pound boxer will return on Cinco de Mayo, but when asked whom he wanted to face, he responded \"I don't f---ing care. ... Nobody can compete with this Canelo.\"\nWell, guess what? We care. With that in mind, here's a look at the field of possible opponents for Alvarez's next fight. The Mexican has two fights remaining on his deal with PBC, so we'll focus on options from that \"side of the street.\"\nWhich fighters are in the running for a shot at a career-high payday? And who has the best chance of winning it? Let's break down the contestants:\nBenavidez is by far the most viable option for Alvarez if he can deliver a statement victory against Demetrius Andrade on Nov. 25 in Las Vegas.\nBenavidez is one of the most entertaining action fighters in the sport and has been lobbying for a bout with Alvarez for years. Benavidez, 26, is coming off a career-best victory, a decision over Caleb Plant in March.\nBenavidez's swarming, pressure style is a load to contend with, as is his power. He's shown the ability to break down quality opponents as fights wear on, but he's never faced someone as talented as Alvarez.\nThis feels like a megafight if Benavidez can come through with an explosive victory over Andrade and build momentum heading into the new year.\n\"I'm focused on Andrade,\" Benavidez told ESPN on Sunday. \"But after this fight, the WBC should mandate the No. 1 contender. After I beat Andrade, we'll be in a pretty good spot to make the fight [against Alvarez] happen for me.\"\nIf Andrade can pull off the upset when he meets Benavidez, he could find himself in pole position to be Alvarez's next challenger.\nThe former two-division champion has long been one of boxing's most-avoided fighters for good reason.\nAn athletic southpaw who's hard to find in the ring, Andrade is undefeated through 32 pro fights. Now 35 years old and in his third weight class, Andrade will have the opportunity to showcase his ability in a major fight he's long yearned for.\nIf \"Boo Boo\" can resemble the elite boxer we've seen when he's at his best, he's a tough fighter to beat. And if Andrade defeats Benavidez, there's already a built-in storyline for a fight with Canelo.\nAfter Alvarez defeated Billy Joe Saunders in May 2021, Andrade crashed the news conference. Canelo responded with a bundle of expletives and a critique of Andrade's competition.\n\"Get the f--- out of here,\" Alvarez told Andrade. \"... You've fought with nobody.\"\nAlvarez has proved he has no problem fighting tricky southpaws, defeating Austin Trout and Erislandy Lara. Andrade can get his opportunity. He first must beat Benavidez.\nCrawford represents the biggest commercial option for Alvarez, a true superfight, but Alvarez didn't seem too interested in that bout at the postfight news conference after beating Charlo.\n\"I always say if the fight makes sense, why not? But [Crawford is] not in the plan,\" Alvarez said.\nThe matchup makes plenty of financial sense for both fighters, but Alvarez has expressed dismay in the past about fighting a much smaller man. Crawford, ESPN's No. 1 pound-for-pound boxer, has never competed above 147 pounds.\nAnd Alvarez, who calls the shots as the sport's top star, isn't going to make any weight concessions.\nBut never say never. Crawford vs. Alvarez represents the biggest money-making event of all the options, so it can't be counted out.\nCharlo was originally slated to fight Alvarez last month, but before the matchup was set, twin brother Jermell stepped in as \"Big Charlo\" dealt with a personal matter.\n\"Same size, same everything. I don't really care which Charlo brother it is,\" Alvarez told ESPN during fight week.\nJermell's lackluster performance against Alvarez likely killed any revenge angle for Jermall. Jermell's strategy against Alvarez produced little action and often elicited boos from the Las Vegas crowd.\nWhile his opportunity might be slipping away, Jermall is set to end a two-and-a-half-year layoff when he fights Jose Benavidez Jr. on the Nov. 25 undercard of Benavidez-Andrade.\nJermall, the WBC middleweight champion who is now training with Roy Jones Jr., last competed in June 2021 when he defeated Juan Macias Montiel.\nBivol is with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom, but he remains a contender to square off with Alvarez because of his win over Canelo in May 2022.\nThat bout, which took place at 175 pounds, wasn't remotely competitive as Bivol proved far too accurate and slick. Alvarez has insisted he wanted Bivol for his second fight of 2023, but only if it took place at 175 pounds.\nBivol, meanwhile, said he was only interested in a rematch for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championship.\nThat didn't happen in September, and it appears unlikely we will see an encore encounter between Alvarez and Bivol in May 2024. Still, the Russian remains the toughest challenger for Alvarez's four 168-pound belts.\n\"He looked good in the fight against Charlo,\" Bivol told ESPN. \"But I did not see anything new from when we last fought.\"\nThe loss clearly still bothers Alvarez, who maintains that he's a better fighter than Bivol and has pointed to his injured left wrist, which required surgery, as a reason for his performance.\nBivol is one spot behind Canelo at No. 5 on ESPN's pound-for-pound list.\nAdames seems like a long-shot option, but he's been adamant on social media that he's in the running.\nThe Dominican signed with Top Rank in 2018 as a much-ballyhooed welterweight prospect. He struggled with the company, and following a loss to Patrick Teixeira at 154 pounds in 2019, Adames was released.\nHe's found new life with PBC at middleweight, rattling off four wins, three of them inside the distance. At 29 years old, Adames feels more than ready for the life-changing opportunity.\n\"I won't run like Jermell. I have more merit than a lot of Canelo's opponents,\" Adames wrote on X . \" ... I have hurt big champions in sparring because I am a big 160.\""}

Or maybe it will be Biles wiping away tears -- or was that an eyelash? -- on the top step of the all-around podium, which featured three Black women for the first time in the sport's history. Or perhaps it will be Biles, 26, tripping over her own feet during her floor performance in the all-around, laughing at herself and then nailing her final tumbling pass.\nReally, it will be all these moments, because Biles is all these things: the most decorated gymnast of all time, a rock for her teammates, a gold standard for a generation of gymnasts, emotional in her return to the sport and unflappable and funny even when her performances don't go precisely to plan.\n\"I was excited being back out here competing, having fun, having that pressure again,\" Biles said after taking gold in the individual event finals on balance beam and floor Sunday afternoon. \"The whole entire experience that we've had at this world championships, I think we learned a lot from it.\"\nTruly the GOAT. 🐐With a gold medal in her final event at #Antwerp2023, @Simone_Biles extends her record as the most decorated gymnast in world championships history with 30 WORLD MEDALS. pic.twitter.com/RADXFOlbfu\nTen years after Biles made her world championship debut in Antwerp, she likely competed in her final world championship here, and it was a memorable one. Team USA won its seventh straight team gold, not with a perfect, dominant performance, but with a gritty one. When 17-year-old Joscelyn Roberson injured her left ankle during vault warmups minutes before competition began, Leanne Wong, 20, a three-time world medalist, stepped in to replace her in the lineups on vault and floor.\n\"I was a little disappointed with my performance, but I think I should be really proud of myself for stepping up and competing the way I did,\" said Wong, who finished seventh in the vault final. \"Winning a gold medal for Team USA is the most unbelievable feeling, hearing the national anthem play and knowing that you were a part of winning a medal for your country.\"\nThe U.S. women's team leaves Antwerp with seven medals. Biles takes home five of her own, which brings her world and Olympic medal count to 37, a record that will stand for a long while -- until she likely adds to it at the Paris Olympics. \"This makes me feel a lot better [about Paris],\" Biles said Sunday. \"We still have meets next year to look forward to and to clean up some work, but it makes me feel really good and a lot more comfortable and competent.\n\"I had to prove to myself that I could still get out here and twist and prove all the haters wrong that I'm not a quitter,\" she said. \"For me, I didn't care [about medals] as long as I'm out there twisting again, having fun and finding the joy for gymnastics again.\"\nThe men's team also made a statement this week, taking bronze in the team final, its first team medal since 2014. Nineteen-year-old Frederick Richard finished third in the all-around and made the floor final, and Khoi Young, 19, took silver on pommel horse and vault. Young became the first U.S. man to win multiple individual apparatus medals since Kurt Thomas and Bart Conner in 1979.\nThe vaults that secured Khoi Young another world championship medal. 🥈He captures silver in the men's vault final, bringing his total medal count at #Antwerp2023 to three.📺 @peacock pic.twitter.com/rcWOnh9v6m\nTeam USA is in a great position less than a year before the Paris Olympics. Here are four more takeaways from world championships as we look ahead to next summer.\nLook no further than the women's team final for proof. Although the U.S. won again, Brazil took silver, winning the first world team medal in the country's history. France earned bronze, its first medal since 1950, and announced its arrival as medal favorites at its home Olympics. China finished in fourth, dropped by a fall on floor and low difficulty scores on vault, but is always in the mix for a team medal.\nLast year's world championship podium included Great Britain (silver) and Canada (bronze), teams that struggled with falls here in Antwerp but are strong contenders when they hit. Both Brazil and China won individual gold medals this year -- in addition to taking silver in the all-around, 2022 world all-around champion Rebeca Andrade of Brazil won vault and took silver on beam and floor, and China's Qiu Qiyuan won uneven bars gold.\nRebeca Andrade IMPECÁVEL nos seus dois saltos no Mundial de Ginástica Artística, em Antuérpia 🇧🇪1º salto: 15.0002º salto: 14.500Nota final: 14.750 pra gritar É CAMPEÃ 🇧🇷 pic.twitter.com/rGcpUIrTiZ\nWithout defending Olympic gold medalists Russia in the mix -- FIG banned the Russian and Belarusian teams after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 -- the podium in Paris is anyone's to grab. Of course, if the U.S. hits -- or even has a fall and a few mistakes, as it had here -- the rest of the world is competing for silver.\nAnd let's not forget Algeria's Kaylia Nemour, who took silver on the uneven bars and delivered her country -- and Africa -- its first world championship medal in history.\nBiles and all-around bronze medalist Shilese Jones, 21, who also took silver on uneven bars, have been rock solid all season and, barring injury or change of plans, look like locks to make the Paris squad. That leaves three open spots, plus alternates.\nWong made a strong case for herself this season, and especially here at worlds, where she did exactly what she was brought to Antwerp to do: hit routines, help the team build strong scores during qualification and step in last-minute in the event of an injury. Roberson also did her part during team qualification, and it's a shame she didn't have the opportunity to perform more than she did.\nShilese Jones shined from every angle to win Bronze! 🥉#Antwerp2023 pic.twitter.com/7WTVPthNtK\n\"I hope when we get home and get an MRI, there is nothing too serious. I hope it's just a sprain,\" said Laurent Landi, who coaches Biles and Roberson. \"She's very, very hungry. And I think that [injury] made her even hungrier for next year.\"\nNone of Biles' Olympic teammates were named to the worlds team, except for alternates Wong and Kayla DiCello, who was also an alternate in Antwerp. But Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Sunisa Lee are all working to be in the mix for a spot on the 2024 team. So too are 2022 national champion Konnor McClain, who's competing at LSU this year; 2012 Olympic all-around champion Gabby Douglas, who announced she's training with an eye on Paris; and the University of Florida's Trinity Thomas, the 2022 NCAA all-around champion, who is back in the gym training and coaching the Gators with plans to return to elite competition next year.\nAnd don't forget the young up-and-comers, several of whom train with Biles, Roberson and Chiles at World Champions Centre in Houston: Tiana Sumanasekera, 16, and Zoe Miller, 17, who will compete at Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, later this month, as well as 15-year-old Dulcy Caylor. Kaliya Lincoln, 16, who trains at WOGA in Frisco, Texas, and is also on the Pan Ams team, is a strong performer on floor and beam.\nRichard, the 2023 NCAA all-around champion from the University of Michigan, took bronze in the all-around, becoming the first American man since 2013 and only the fourth ever to medal in the all-around at worlds. After the medal ceremony, he tossed his stuffed \"Gymbo\" mascot to his mom, Ann-Marie, in the stands and told reporters he hopes his performances -- and his clothing brand, Frederick Flips -- help to grow the sport.\n👀👀👀With just one more rotation to go, 19-year-old American Fred Richard currently sits in first after this routine on the parallel bars.#Antwerp2023 | 📺 @peacock pic.twitter.com/37g1YKQoxH\n\"I want my brand to outlive me in the sport,\" he said. \"I want it to take over the sport for men's and women's gymnastics, and then go to other flipping sports like Parkour and cheerleading.\"\nBut first, Richard said he wants to reach for the performance level of Biles. \"I love just watching the way she competes,\" he said. \"It looks like she's just showing off to the world and that's what I'm trying to replicate. I want to eventually get to that level where I'm just performing for you guys and the gold medal is set.\"\nThe men's team leaves Antwerp with three medals and has a real shot at doing the same -- or better -- in Paris next summer. That speaks to the effectiveness of a move by USA Gymnastics after the Tokyo Games to add bonuses that incentivize gymnasts to attempt more difficult skills in order to compete with countries like Japan and China, the most dominant teams in men's gymnastics this quad.\nIn Antwerp, the Japanese and Chinese teams took gold and silver, respectively, and Japan's Daiki Hashimoto, 22, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, won his second straight world all-around title.\nBACK-TO BACK 🥇Japan's Daiki Hashimoto wins the men's all-around once again. #Antwerp2023 pic.twitter.com/t1IJaacsGV\n\"They're only going to get closer [as a team] from here and more hungry,\" U.S. men's program VP Brett McClure said after the team final. \"Since we've been in a drought, now [an Olympic medal] is attainable.\"\nThe U.S. men's most recent Olympic team medal is a bronze from Beijing in 2008, and they've won the Games only once, in Los Angeles in 1984. \"The reality has set in that they can actually do this,\" McClure said. \"It's not some unicorn off in the distance that doesn't exist.

Allmendinger, who became a father within the past month, was sobbing when he collected the checkered flag.\n\"Because you don't know when you are going to do it again,\" cried Allmendinger, who turns 42 in December. He said he normally gives the checkered flag away to a fan but was keeping Sunday's flag for his newborn son.\n\"That was probably the drive of my life,\" he said later.\nAllmendinger then went into the stands to pose for selfies with the fans chanting his name. It was the third Cup Series win for Allmendinger, who has raced across 16 Cup seasons but took a break from NASCAR's top series in 2019 and 2020. Kaulig slowly lured him back with five Cup races in 2021, all the way to this year's full season in Kaulig's second year fielding cars at the elite level.\n\"I hate crying right now, but it's a freaking Cup race, man. You don't know when it's ever going to happen again,\" Allmendinger said. \"This is why you do it. This is the only reason you do it. You fight. All the blood, sweat, tears. It's our second year in the Cup Series.\"\nAllmendinger won four consecutive Xfinity Series races on the hybrid road course/oval but wasn't entered Saturday for Kaulig because he's already exhausted his allotted five starts in the second-tier series. Allmendinger won twice in Xfinity Series, and it's unclear if he'll be in the Cup Series or return to the Xfinity Series next year.\nEither way, his win was pivotal in the playoff elimination of Kyle Busch, the two-time series champion who had to win Sunday to advance to the round of eight. Busch gave it a few tries but couldn't get into second place -- William Byron finished second -- and Busch settled for third.\nBusch was uncharacteristically optimistic after elimination and said he'll try to win each of the final four races.\n\"I would love to be the spoiler. That would be fun,\" Busch said. \"We've got our work cut out for us, but we'll keep building.\"\nAlso eliminated was Ross Chastain, last year's title runner-up, 2012 champion Brad Keselowski and Bubba Wallace, whose first playoff appearance ended in the round of 12 on his 30th birthday with 23XI Racing co-owner Michael Jordan watching from Wallace's pit stand.\n\"We weren't supposed to be here, according to a lot of people, but we proved them wrong,\" said Wallace, who finished 16th. \"... Got to continue to work. I don't think we're a winning car yet, but we're light years from where we were a few races ago.\"\nIt was a brutal day for Chevrolet, which lost both popular Chastain of Trackhouse Racing and a resurgent Busch, who won three times in his first season driving for Richard Childress Racing. He's been a boost to the organization, which won its last championship in 1994 with the late Dale Earnhardt.\n\"First year at RCR, means a lot to me for Richard having me and for the Chevy guys having me, everybody, to get this far,\" Busch said. \"Rides on me to get to the next round, so I've just got to do a better job.\"\nKeselowski knocked a Ford team out, while Toyota lost a championship chance with Wallace.\nMoving on\nThe remaining eight drivers in the championship race are led by Byron and Ryan Blaney, who both won in this round to earn automatic berths out of the round of 12.\nDenny Hamlin advanced in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing, as did Tyler Reddick, who drives for Hamlin and Jordan at 23XI Racing. Christopher Bell and Martin Truex Jr., the regular season champion, advanced with Hamlin for Gibbs to get three cars through.\nKyle Larson drove a backup car to a 13th-place finish to join Byron, who has a series-best six wins this season, representing Hendrick Motorsports and Chevrolet in the next round. Larson crashed in Saturday practice and Hendrick Motorsports, which is located about a mile from the speedway, had to work into the night to get a car through Sunday morning inspection.\nFord has Blaney of Team Penske and Chris Buescher of RFK Racing, which didn't advance Keselowski through but still has one driver racing for the championship.\nHamlin had already locked himself into the round of eight earlier in the race via stage points, so his last-place finish Sunday was irrelevant.\n\"We've already shifted our focus to Vegas and we'll see what we can do there,\" Hamlin said. \"Really optimistic for the next three weeks.\"\nUp next\nThe round of eight of NASCAR's playoffs opens Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

{"title": "European women's review: Greenwood red baffles, late goals a theme", "date": "2023-10-09 13:47:43", "text": "Sophie Lawson reacts to a 1-1 WSL draw between Man City and Chelsea, as the hosts have two players sent off. (1:23)\nThere was one major bone of contention in the Women's Super League (WSL) this weekend as those new refereeing standards caused issues again. These are the key talking points from the WSL, along with some highlights from European action.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nYeah, we really have to start with this one, don't we? As highlighted last week, there has been a concerted clampdown on fouls, perceived timewasting and dissent in the WSL, but those new rules were pushed to the limit on Sunday afternoon as Manchester City had two players sent off in their 1-1 draw with Chelsea. Chelsea's Guro Reiten scrambled a 96th-minute equaliser to cancel out Chloe Kelly's seventh-minute opener.\nBut it was a match that, ultimately, had very little football in it after the 37th-minute sending off of City captain Alex Greenwood for a second yellow card as she apparently took too long (a whole 26 seconds) over a free kick. In total, referee Emily Heaslip brandished 11 cautions -- three for City's Kelly, Laia Aleixandri and Jill Roord in protest at the decision -- including second yellows for Greenwood and then Lauren Hemp in the 81st minute, as most fouls or dissent seemed to carry an automatic booking.\nRather than adding a layer of protection for the players, or building trust and respect between herself and those on the pitch, Heaslip's interventions left no room for common sense as she followed the letter of the law to the extreme. An engrossing game quickly descended into chaos as the referee took centre stage and ended up on the end of constant booing and chants of \"cheat\" from the home crowd.\nAnyone who regularly watches women's football knows that far too many fouls are let go and players have been put in danger for years by lax officiating. But what we saw in Manchester was a rapid overcorrection that doesn't benefit anyone.\nHeaslip generally sets a high standard for officiating in WSL, allowing games to flow, using her time as a player to read the game and consider the nuances and intent. Yet none of that pedigree was on show at the Joie Stadium as she tried to follow the WSL's new guidance.\nAfter sealing a double of WSL and FA Cup for Chelsea in 2022-23, manager Emma Hayes called their season \"a grind.\" The football had been far from vintage for sizable chunks, but her side were still able to pick up more silverware come the end of the season.\nTwo games into this campaign and there is still the same ragged look to the champions. In the first 37 minutes against City, when it was 11 vs. 11, they were entirely overrun. Even against 10 players after the sending off of Greenwood, the Blues continued to struggle. Fresh legs off the bench helped the visitors settle eventually, as they hit the woodwork three times, but there was an impotence to the team hotly tipped to lift a fifth consecutive WSL crown.\nAway days in Manchester are historically the hardest for the Blues, but their midfield was too easily bypassed, and their attack had no fluency and balance. A lack of fitness to key players -- with Australia star Sam Kerr only coming off the bench at half-time and Erin Cuthbert making her first competitive start since July -- didn't help the ring-rust, but they did enough to claim a draw as Reiten's scrappy equaliser in the 96th-minute took advantage of City being down to eight players, with defender Alanna Kennedy off the pitch receiving treatment. They will have to be better than this, though.\nThere are three coaches who have more than one WSL title: Chelsea's Emma Hayes (six), former Arsenal boss Laura Harvey (two) and Liverpool's Matt Beard (also two). Although Beard's triumphs came in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, he helped set a blueprint in the burgeoning league. Now in his second stint back at Liverpool, Beard's side are going from strength to strength.\nAfter leading the team back to the WSL in 2022-23, following their relegation, the 45-year-old lifted the level of his squad to make them a competitive force again, all the while negating the usual issues that come with the jump back up. Their first season back was dotted with gutsy performances and memorable results as they finished a respectable seventh and, two games into this season, Beard looks to have once again raised the bar.\nAfter a 1-0 opening-day win against Arsenal at the Emirates, where Liverpool nullified their opponents' strengths, the Reds again put in a smart performance in a 2-0 win against Aston Villa with goals from Marie Hobinger and Natasha Flint. It's a long season that will be full of twists and turns. But, after two games, there are signs that the Reds are flourishing; the players are all on the same page, enjoying their football, and their manager is clearly able to get the best out of them.\nAfter an opening-day loss to Manchester City when they struggled to get a foot on the ball, there may have been alarm bells going off for West Ham. But under new coach Rehanne Skinner the Irons played some of their best football in recent memory for a 2-0 win over Brighton.\nHaving gone through a number of different coaches and styles over their five-year stint in the WSL, it has been hard for the club to find an identity. But this win was punctuated with the attacking style that Skinner alluded to before the start of the season, with her frontline putting on a show.\nSummer signing Riko Ueki impressed, having a hand in both goals and spending her 78 minutes on the pitch putting the Brighton defence under constant pressure. And, whether on the front foot or weathering a storm defensively late in the first half, the Hammers remained composed throughout and held out as goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold kept her first clean sheet of the season.\nFrom Arsenal and Chelsea, to Juventus and Real Madrid, game-changing late goals are fast becoming a theme around Europe this season. Cloe Lacasse saved the Gunners in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United on Friday night, while we have covered Reiten's equaliser for Chelsea above.\nBut both Spanish and Italian runners up from last season also left it late against their respective opposition on Saturday. Arianna Caruso's match-winner for Juve against AC Milan came in the 87th minute, while Signe Bruun connected with Olga Carmona's low cross in 90th-minute for Real Madrid to seal a 1-0 win over Villarreal.\nHaving invested heavily over the summer to add more depth and quality to the team, losing key player Caroline Weir to an ACL injury last month has seen the rest of the team required to pick up the slack. Even still, Las Blancas laboured against a Villarreal side who are without a win in Liga F so far this season, before snatching all three points.\nDrifting towards their first loss in five games, Swedish Damallsvenskan side Vittsjö grabbed a last-gasp equaliser in a 1-1 draw against league leaders Häcken as goalkeeper Lainey Burdett struck from a stoppage-time corner.\nTrailing to Rosa Kafaj's ninth-minute effort, the Las Vegan-born shot stopper's gamble paid dividends for Vittsjö as she rose to meet Sarah Stratigakis' floated delivery with the side of her head to salvage a point. It was a goal that kept her team's hopes of finishing in a European berth alive as the fourth-placed side sit five points adrift of a qualification spot with four games left to play."}

{"title": "Just how good is Usman Nurmagomedov?", "date": "2023-10-09 14:14:36", "text": "Three champions put their titles on the line at Bellator 300 on Saturday. Three champions dominated.\nThe event at Pechanga Arena in San Diego showed off some high-level command from two champs and a little workmanlike mastery from the third. Lightweight champ Usman Nurmagomedov did the improbable in the main event, outshining a legend, women's featherweight titlist Cris Cyborg, who'd just put on a thrashing in the co-main. And Liz Carmouche, while not an entertainer in her women's flyweight title defense, got an emotionally challenging job done with unemotional efficiency.\nAs for the \"300\" part attached to the fight card, that's a nice, big number, showing Bellator has persevered since its founding 14 years ago. The promotion has delivered some big moments, as well as some bizarre ones. But was this a milestone for the company or a roadside marker indicating the end is right up ahead? Reports and rumors have been swirling that Bellator is on the verge of being bought by the PFL, putting the promotion's future in doubt. At this point, the only event scheduled is next month's Bellator 301. Is that the last we'll see of Bellator?\nJeff Wagenheim and Brett Okamoto offer some thoughts on all things Bellator -- what happened Saturday night at Bellator 300 and what it means for the fighters' futures, as well as what might happen in Bellator's near future and what it means for the fight promotion.\nWagenheim: Let me begin by pointing out that my sorting of the top 10 is totally unofficial, ESPN-wise, since it's Brett, not I, who decides on our divisional rankings. But I do have an opinion -- surprise, surprise, longtime readers -- and in my view Nurmagomedov has shown himself worthy of a spot.\nWhich spot, though? I'm leaning toward the lower end of the rankings, based on the 25-year-old's lightweight title defense at Bellator 300 and other recent performances. Nurmagomedov is undefeated, just like his cousin Khabib was. Usman has been dominant, just like Khabib. But the level of competition matters. Whereas Khabib Nurmagomedov finished his career with whuppings of Justin Gaethje, Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor, Usman Nurmagomedov's last three wins have come against up-and-down Brent Primus, one-step-in-the-retirement-home Benson Henderson and Patricky \"The Lesser Pitbull\" Freire. This is not the most definitive measuring stick.\nI'd love to see Nurmagomedov face a stiffer test, one that disrupts his flow state. Saturday's fight against Primus seemed to be unfolding in slow motion for Nurmagomedov, who gracefully dodged practically everything thrown his way by maintaining a pace and a distance where he could strike and not get struck back. It was a safe, winning strategy, and the champ showed poise and command. But it felt like he was coasting. We need to see him pushed and see him push back.\nNurmagomedov is slated to next fight in the final of the Bellator Lightweight World Grand Prix against the winner of the Nov. 17 semifinal between Freire and Alexander Shabliy. We've already seen how the champ matches up with \"Pitbull,\" but Shabliy, winner of eight in a row and 15 of his last 16, might give his fellow Russian a run.\nPerhaps down the road, we'll see Nurmagomedov in with the other (and better) \"Pitbull,\" Patricio, or dynamic AJ McKee. Or maybe we can measure him against ESPN's No. 1 lightweight and arguably the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, UFC champ Islam Makhachev. They tussle all the time as training partners at American Kickboxing Academy in California. Oh, to be a fly on the wall at one of their sparring sessions. That might be all we need to form a more precise opinion of where Nurmagomedov belongs in the top 10.\nWagenheim: Cyborg and Carmouche scored finishes at Bellator 301. But that is where the comparison ends.\nActually, that's where the comparison of their current state as fighters ends. In the big picture of women's MMA history, both have been key participants in seminal moments. When Cyborg knocked out Gina Carano -- the sport's first crossover star -- in a 2009 Strikeforce women's featherweight title bout, it was the first time a women's fight headlined a major MMA event. And in 2013, Carmouche fought in the first women's bout in UFC history, falling to Ronda Rousey by -- what else -- armbar submission. But Carmouche nearly finished \"Rowdy Ronda\" early in that fight after gaining back control, and boy would that have changed the story of women's MMA.\nBeyond those breakthroughs, the two women's paths diverge. Carmouche has had a few nice moments over the years, while Cyborg has authored a legendary career. And at Bellator 300, Cyborg showed she is not slowing down. Actually, she is slowing down -- but in a good way. Instead of charging out of her corner on Saturday with the old Cyborg blitz, which won her some highlight-reel quick finishes earlier in her career, Cyborg showed poise in walking down Cat Zingano on the way to a TKO late in the first round. She took Zingano apart more methodically than explosively.\nCyborg is 38 years old, and speed is the first thing to go for a fighter. So, her newfound patience will serve her well. It might be the thing that keeps her near the top of the women's game for years.\nIf the Bellator sale to the PFL goes through, Cyborg will work for the same company as Kayla Harrison and Larissa Pacheco. Fights against those would be two of the biggest in women's MMA, true legacy enhancers for whoever gets her hand raised.\nAs for Carmouche, she is not on Cyborg's level -- now or ever -- but she showed on Saturday that she remains strong and smart four months away from turning 40. Fighting longtime friend and former training partner Ilima-Lei Macfarlane, Carmouche didn't let loose with anything resembling fury but gradually broke down the former champ with leg kicks. And while that low engagement annoyed the crowd, it ensured that the champ would not get caught by a desperate shot. It was a sustainable strategy for Carmouche.\nBut who knows what the future will hold for Carmouche? If the Bellator sale happens and fighters are assimilated into the PFL, would there be a home for the women who fight at flyweight? Stay tuned.\nOkamoto: A couple of weeks ago, in a Five Rounds segment, I wrote that Bellator's bantamweight title fight between Sergio Pettis and Patchy Mix is the most underrated fight for the rest of the year. I challenge anyone to argue any differently.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nPettis is on a six-fight win streak, with his last two coming against tough competition in Patricio \"Pitbull\" Freire and Kyoji Horiguchi. Before that, he faced Juan Archuleta, who is no easy task, either. Pettis is ESPN's No. 7-ranked bantamweight, with a case to be in the top 5. And that's the most stacked division in the sport right now, particularly at the top. Mix might be one of the most underrated fighters in the world right now. He's a guy who finishes fights at 135 pounds and he is bringing a ton of momentum into this title fight. This is just a world-class matchup in a division that's on fire right now -- especially in the UFC. If you added these two to the UFC's roster, on top of what's already going, it would be the strongest division the UFC has had in years.\nThe rest of the Bellator 301 card is very good as well. AJ McKee will continue his new run at lightweight. Ukrainian welterweight champion Yaroslav Amosov is a worthy headliner. But for me, this card is mainly about the 135-pound title fight, which I consider one of the top fights on the MMA calendar.\nOkamoto: To be determined. Rumors of Bellator MMA's demise (or its absorption by PFL) have been swirling for the better part of this year. Showtime's long-term interest in combat sports, in general, would seem to be on its deathbed. If Bellator does hold another event past Bellator 301, it would likely occur in December, although no fights are officially booked at this time. One industry member probably put it best to me in a text message: \"It's up in the air.\"\nFor the sport, it would be great to see Bellator continue to exist on its own, but from a business perspective, this move would probably be well overdue for Showtime -- and its parent company, Viacom. Bellator has some world-class fighters under contract, but as a whole, the promotion has lacked direction and enthusiasm for quite some time now. There have been advanced talks of a PFL acquisition, and that is the outcome I anticipate at the moment.\nBellator president Scott Coker's comment over the weekend that \"these things take time\" was probably the most accurate, insightful update he could provide. The interest and desire are there to combine companies, but all of the sorting out of details takes time. How much time, we'll see. But Bellator's days do seem numbered."}

(1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind. With the majority of drafted players entering the NBA in their late teens or very early 20s, and many of those players international, the development process from prospect to professional can extend beyond a single season. .\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball.\nAs you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}

(2:20)\nWe say it every year -- typically, rookies aren't drafted until the middle to late rounds in fantasy basketball.\nYes, every now and then, there's a hyped up player who sneaks into round three (like this year), but most seasons the top rookie won't go until the fourth or fifth round at the earliest.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThis presents a major opportunity for the savvy fantasy manager, who dedicates the early rounds to setting up the foundation of their team while having a certain rookie or two in mind for the middle and late rounds. Find the right rookies, and this can be a winning formula.\nBut who are the rookies to have this season? And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ½ inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}
{"title": "Goalie tandem picks: Which player should you draft?", "date": "2023-10-03 12:54:37", "text": "I feel like it's safer trying to predict the rainfall on a day six months from now than it is to confidently state how the goaltender position will play out in the coming fantasy hockey season.\nThat's not to say there aren't safer bets out there -- but you have to pay for them. Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Jake Oettinger, Connor Hellebuyck ... they are likely to be better investments for your fantasy squad, but they'll cost a high draft pick.\nBut winning your league last year was better accomplished by drafting Linus Ullmark and Alexandar Georgiev, which was just a matter of backing the right two sleepers. Who will those sleepers be this season? As implied, that's a tough call.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nMore than ever, a winning fantasy strategy can be lifted from the world of tandems. When one emerges and dominates, it's a low-cost draft investment that can lead to championships (think Ullmark). But even if the time split remains, goaltenders can earn fantasy value -- Ilya Samsonov placed 108th overall last season with only 50.2% crease share and Filip Gustavsson was 81st overall with only 46.5% crease share.\nWe've listed the teams below most likely to use a tandem this season. Some are more likely than others and some are just a guess given the current status of their goaltenders. There's also a chance we missed some that could emerge. But when doing your draft shopping for your crease, don't overlook the potential value of a goaltender projected to get just 50% of the crease share.\nRelevant stats for each goaltender include their crease share from last season, their overall ranking for fantasy, their fantasy points per 60 minutes, and their average draft position so far this draft season. Remember that an ADP higher than about 220 means they are not being drafted in most ESPN leagues.\nLinus Ullmark: 58.9% crease share, fourth overall fantasy points, 5.38 fantasy points per game (FPP60), 38.2 average draft position (ADP)\nJeremy Swayman: 41.1% crease share, 144th overall, 4.04 FPP60, 108.6 ADP\nThis is the potential tandem that will offer the most headaches for fantasy managers. Ullmark blew away the field last season and would be a no-brainer first-round fantasy pick if we knew he was going to do it again. But so many offseason changes, not the least of which was the retirement of Patrice Bergeron, leaves a lot of questions. Are the Bruins as good defensively? Do they win as frequently? But even beyond those questions, Swayman earned himself a raise and a chance to prove he has a long-term future as a starter for the club.\nI would not advise paying the premium for Ullmark given the question marks, but if he falls in your lap closer to the 70th-overall pick, I could get on board. Given that Swayman is on the weak side of the tandem, his draft price of 108th on average is also on the high end. But let's be clear: Both of these goaltenders have the potential to be fantasy difference-markers in 2023-24. The problem is that we can't say that with heaps of confidence for either one.\nAdin Hill: 33.7% crease share, 451st overall, 3.02 FPP60, 211.3 ADP\nLogan Thompson: 49.1% crease share, 248th overall, 2.99 FPP60, 241.9 ADP\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nNeither goaltender was a staple of fantasy clubs for most of last season, though Thompson had some nice runs earlier in the campaign. But we all know what Hill did after the regular season in leading the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup. There's an argument to be made that this isn't a tandem coming into the season, with Hill earning a massive raise, but Hill has never played more than 27 games in an NHL season before, so it's hard to call him a workhorse starter at this stage.\nThis will probably be a \"hot-hand\" crease, with whichever goaltender is having a solid run getting the lion's share of starts. After Hill was so dominant in the postseason, he would be my preference for a fantasy team. That said, there is a chance you can secure both later in drafts and have the crease of the defending champions locked up on your roster.\nStuart Skinner: 58.9% crease share, 132nd overall, 2.86 FPP60, 158.0 ADP\nJack Campbell: 41.1% crease share, 627th overall, 1.29 FPP60, 229.0 ADP\nThis tandem, like the Golden Knights, had a flip-flop from the regular season to the postseason. Skinner was the hero in the regular season, taking the starting job away from Campbell and keeping the Oilers on track for the playoffs. But Skinner stumbled in the postseason, with Campbell coming on in relief multiple times and not looking too bad. That narrative from the playoffs was arguably enough for a soft reset on whose crease this is coming into 2023-24.\nThe Oilers should win plenty of games with their overpowered offense and upgraded defense, but who is going to be in the crease for most of those wins? Skinner's ADP is very palatable, but you shouldn't completely count out Campbell at this stage. In fact, this might be an old school insurance scenario in which drafting Skinner means you should target Campbell in the final rounds to play it safe. There is value to be had here, as the Oilers are a 50-win team these days.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever!

Sign up for free today be the commish!\nFrederik Andersen: 40.1% crease share, 430th overall, 2.34 FPP60, 155.6 ADP\nAntti Raanta: 31.5% crease share, 339th overall, 3.54 FPP60, 230.3 ADP\nPyotr Kochetkov: 28.4% crease share, 506th overall, 2.78 FPP60, 211.1 ADP\nThis is probably the messiest of the creases in the NHL, but also one of the best for a goaltender to generate fantasy value. When both Andersen and Raanta were hurt last season, Kochetkov had a chance to show he could do the job in net. But the rookie faded with his chances later in the season, ultimately leaving the Hurricanes to decide to re-sign both Andersen and Raanta on fairly short-term deals. Kochetkov, now 24, can be sent down to the AHL without risking waivers, so he'll be the No. 3 goaltender for the Canes this season.\nThen there's the Andersen or Raanta debate. Raanta was the better goaltender of the two last season, posting better ratios and almost as many wins in fewer starts, but we are only two years removed from when Andersen finished 24th overall in fantasy in 2021-22 with 3.85 FPP60.\nHealth will be the first and foremost concern, as Andersen and Raanta were both fragile last season and the season prior (recall that Andersen missed the 2021-22 playoffs). That said, the Hurricanes wouldn't invest in Andersen and Raanta again unless they thought one of them could be the guy for at least one more season with Kochetkov still waiver eligible. Andersen's ADP is actually trending low if he ends up getting the bulk of starts here, which is the most likely scenario.\nCam Talbot: 40.1% crease share, 587th overall, 1.57 FPP60 (with Ottawa Senators), 219.5 ADP\nPheonix Copley: 42.2% crease share, 351st overall, 2.56 FPP60, 230.2 ADP\nAs much as Copley saved the Kings from themselves last season, he apparently didn't do enough to get a clear shot at the starter's gig yet. Copley was a huge stabilizer for the Kings last season, winning twice as many games as anyone else on the roster. But his ratios weren't great and faded down the stretch. The Kings brought in Joonas Korpisalo at the trade deadline, but Korpisalo opted for the Ottawa Senators in the offseason. The natural choice from there? Sign the Senators goaltender from last season. Cam Talbot had a rough year, earning almost no fantasy value, and is now 36 years old. The age is a major concern, as Talbot is past the spot on the goaltender curve where they usually remain productive for fantasy. But Copley, adequate, wasn't exactly changing the game for fantasy managers in his 37 games last season.\nTalbot hasn't had as much wear and tear as some other 36-year-old goaltenders, spending a lot of his career as a backup. So there is a world in which he can pull out another solid season behind a solid squad. Copley doesn't have a lot of upside, so the ideal situation here is Talbot hanging on for another year of value and getting the bulk of starts. He's the one to take a chance on.\nVitek Vanecek: 59.0% crease share, 111th overall, 3.08 FPP60, 116.2 ADP\nAkira Schmid: 18.2% crease share, 574th overall, 3.48 FPP60, 228.4 ADP\nJordan Binnington: 71.4% crease share, 541st overall, 1.00 FPP60, 228.1 ADP\nJoel Hofer: 6.4% crease share, 805th overall, 2.16 FPP60, 230.0, ADP\nNeither of these teams look like they will have a tandem on paper. But Schmid and Hofer have both shown glimpses and are both 23 coming into the season, which is about the age goaltenders really start coming on. If you are drafting Vanecek, Schmid is a good idea to handcuff. You probably shouldn't be looking at Binnington for your crease, but Hofer has upside if he pushes for more time.\nReady to play?
