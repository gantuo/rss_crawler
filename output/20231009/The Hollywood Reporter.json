Trian is expected to request multiple seats on Disney’s board of directors, including one for Peltz, the source says.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDoes Disney's Management of Hulu and ESPN Violate Antitrust Laws? A Judge Weighs In\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney Distribution Vet Ken Caldwell to Retire After Nearly 40 Years (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIf Disney does not agree to this, the fund may look to again nominate alternative directors ahead of the Hollywood conglomerate’s annual meeting in the spring. The source added that Trian gave Disney and Iger time to turn the company around after the CEO announced a turnaround plan back in February, but that the stock slump spurred on the decision to make a new board play.\n\n\tThe fund feels the Disney board should strengthen its alignment with shareholders given Disney’s stock has fallen from around $113 in early February to $82.94 as of Friday’s market close.\n\n\tPeltz abandoned his attempt to win representation on Disney’s board after the company unveiled major cost cuts and other initiatives under Iger. “This was a great win for all the shareholders. Management at Disney now plans to do everything that we wanted them to do,” Peltz said on CNBC back then. However, he also emphasized that Disney and Iger had to deliver on their promises.\n\n\tDisney back then said: “We are pleased that our board and management can remain focused without the distraction of a proxy contest, and we have tremendous faith in Bob Iger’s leadership and the transformative vision for Disney’s future he set forth.”\n\n\tIt has since then been exploring strategic alternatives for such assets as Hulu, its broadcast business and its Indian operations.\n\n\tOne thing that is not clear in the new Trian effort is whether former Marvel chairman Ike Perlmutter is involved. Perlmutter — a friend of Peltz’s and a fellow Palm Beach resident — was involved in the last proxy fight, and held millions of Disney shares. It is now known how much is stake is currently.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPerlmutter was laid off from Disney’s Marvel Entertainment division (not associated with Marvel Studios) in March.\n\n\t“I have long expected that my working relationship with Disney would end. That it should come as a result of my trying to help Disney improve its business should sadden many shareholders as it does me, the company’s largest individual shareholder,” Perlmutter said in a statement after the termination.\n\n\tA spokesperson for Trian declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported Peltz’s new push.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon last week initiated coverage of the media and telcom sector, with Disney as one of his two favorite stocks, rating it at “outperform” with a $103 stock price target. Calling Disney “the only credible challenger to Netflix,” he said that “we are bullish on Disney’s potential to transition to direct-to-consumer at scale once combined with Hulu.” He added about Hulu: “Disney has more to gain with full control of the asset, and (a) favorable resolution of the deal (with Comcast) will likely lift a modest overhang on the stock.”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
{"title": "Meet Tom Brady’s Hollywood Marketing Machine: Shadow Lion", "date": "2023-10-09 13:05:00", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nWith work for brands like Hasbro and EA Sports under its belt, the creative studio launched to support the former NFL star's off-field ambitions has expanded well beyond the quarterback's social channels.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tAshley Cullins\n\nSenior Business Editor\n\n\tWell before NFL star Tom Brady retired from professional football, his off-field legacy was beginning to take shape through a business that’s grown from a handful of people dedicated to optimizing the quarterback’s social media opportunities to a multidimensional creative studio with about 20 employees across the country.\n\n\tThe company is called Shadow Lion, and it was founded in 2017 by a core team including Brady’s longtime manager Ben Rawitz, Jeff Fine (who happens to be Rawitz’s brother), and Gilad Haas who previously worked for Brady’s New England Patriots teammate Julian Edelman. The firm is one of a few celebrity founded marketing agencies — think: Ryan Reynolds’ Maximum Effort — that have cropped up in recent years. \n\n\tThe buzzy Hertz commercials? That was them. The Emmy-winning series Tom vs. Time? They worked on that, alongside Religion of Sports, too.\n\n\tBut in the years since the creative studio was founded to advance Brady’s off-field endeavors, they’ve expanded well beyond the lion’s shadow, so to speak. They’re focusing on audience-specific content, whether that’s a 10-second social clip or a 30-minute docuseries, and aspire to be a household name when it comes to creating standout creative work, similar to what A24 is doing in Hollywood. They’ve built a roster of clients including some of the biggest brands out there, like Pepsi, Hasbro, Under Armour, Aston Martin, Meta, Peacock and the NFL, and have worked with elite athletes like JJ Watt, Zdeno Chára and Mookie Betts.\n\n\t“When you see a Shadow Lion project, whether it’s a campaign for a brand, or a film, TV or audio project, we want it to be synonymous with quality,” says Haas, Shadow Lion’s managing director. “We want people to seek out the things we’re producing because they’re fans of the creatives we have and the content we produce.” (With multiple yet-to-be-announced original content projects in the pipeline, they’re well on their way.)\n\n\tRawitz, Fine and Haas talked with The Hollywood Reporter about how Madden 2018 sparked the launch of Shadow Lion, why “ego is the enemy” and where the company is headed next. \n\nHow was Shadow Lion formed?\n\nBen Rawitz: I’ve been working with Tom Brady for the last 15-plus years. It was an operation of really just me, Tom, and his agent. We needed some extra help in Tom’s world as social media was growing and my brother Jeff was graduating college at that time. Jeff came on in 2013 to support Tom, myself and everything else that was going on.\n\nJeff Fine: For a couple years there we were just helping build Tom’s presence on social media, which was just Facebook at this point. In general, people like Tom were gaining control over their story and these channels were growing. There were a lot of opportunities to work closely with brands. Gilad was working with Julian Edelman at the time and a mutual friend introduced us. We had seen some of each others’ videos and immediately hit it off. It was a no-brainer to figure out a way to work together. That was really the birth of the idea of starting the company. We were all interested in a creative career and in building something. \n\nRawitz: There was a natural progression on the deal side with athletes in general, not just Tom, where athletes’ social media were becoming part of deals. Companies and brands wanted to own a part of social media, which was great because the athlete can use their own voice and make it more authentic. So it was a win-win.\n\nGilad Haas: Within the first couple months we had an opportunity beyond Tom’s social, and maintaining that organically, to work with a commercial partner in EA Sports. They were launching Tom on the cover of Madden 2018. They weren’t entirely sure how to announce it, but they knew they wanted to do something special and to take advantage of Tom’s momentum and growth on his social channels. We ended up producing two pieces of content for them with Tom in 45 minutes and they became Tom’s highest engaging branded content thus far. It set off a light bulb for Tom and for us that there was an opportunity here to create really high-quality and engaging content, and ensure that time-on-task for talent is incredibly efficient. It was a catalyst to us formally creating Shadow Lion in August of 2017.\n\nWhy go beyond Tom? Because his business alone would be enough for you guys to keep busy.\n\nHaas: As we were working more in Tom’s world, we were coming across other athletes and brands who were familiar with the work we had produced without knowing we had produced it. It just kind of seemed like a natural next step for us. We felt like we had the bandwidth to do more, and there were new opportunities for us. As storytellers, there is an innate curiosity in all of us at Shadow Lion, and I think  that curiosity can’t be fed through working on Tom-exclusive projects. The opportunity to branch out was going to be something that fueled us and created some fulfillment beyond what we were doing day-to-day for Tom.\n\nRawitz: There was also a shoot with Uggs, I remember. They had spent months on end trying to come up with a concept that would fit for Tom and they were paying a big agency. Ultimately it was like, “Hey, can you guys concept some ideas?” Because we know Tom, and at that point we had a great understanding of Uggs, we were able to come up with some great ideas and use Tom’s time-on-task. I think we saw that there’s a need for this kind of internal, almost from the athlete’s perspective, storytelling.\n\nFine: We have had an interest from the very beginning in growing as people and as creatives and have interests outside of sports. We see how growing different creative experiences can help enrich the work that we do with Tom. It’ll help us grow the team, help us produce at a high level. It is, in a way, as simple as that: We want it to grow.\n\nHow has Shadow Lion grown since then and what does the business look like today?\n\nHaas: At the beginning it was kind of exclusively oriented around Tom and his world. There are three main arms of our business now. There’s the agency side of our business where we continue to support Tom across his off-field opportunities and we work with elite athletes and entertainers and other figures in a similar capacity. We’re the social agency of record for a couple of large brands, and we do social strategy and execution as one-off projects for large brands. Then the other side of our business is original content, ideating, developing, packaging, producing and executing on unscripted, scripted and audio content.\n\n\tSandwiched between those two arms, agency and original content, is our production team. That’s really enabled us to handle everything internally. When you’re working in the digital marketing landscape and original content, being able to move fast and ensure the quality and end product is what you want it to be is super important. The ability for us to handle a lot of that production internally has really benefited us in our growth. \n\nWhat do you consider some of your biggest success stories so far?\n\nRawitz: To me, the biggest success is the people here at Shadow Lion and the vibe in the office. Everybody gets excited about coming to work every day. It’s one of the best environments I’ve been in. So, to me personally, it’s the people in this family at Shadow Lion.\n\nFine: I would definitely echo that. We’ve really built a team that cares about each other as people and it extends to the work. The through line is just the relationships. It’s nice to have that as a baseline in everything you do. We want everything we work on to be the best it can be and that really carries through and drives our growth as people and as a company.\n\nHaas: We talked a lot about Tom’s social media for obvious reasons. What we’ve demonstrated there was the biggest proof of concept that we needed to show other folks what we were capable of doing. [Tom is] one of the most transcendent generational athletes, also known for extreme privacy and eliminating distractions on the field, and being able to create a consistent, creative and engaging social presence for him is something that we all have taken pride in. \n\n\tEA Sports has brought us back every single year pretty much since that inception project that we did with Tom, helping them announce their ratings week or helping them with in-game content in Madden 23 this past year with Chad Ochocinco. We did a doc series on Zdeno Chára, who was captain of the Boston Bruins, that was on Peacock. Being able to follow him for two years and tell his story helped us really set a foundation for everything that’s to come and reinvigorated the whole team. There’s Team Impact, which is a charity that pairs chronically ill children with athletic programs at colleges and universities and makes them official teammates of those teams. We’re excited at the potential of taking a larger role with them, and we’ve been able to see that what we produce has materially affected kids’ lives. \n\n\tEchoing Ben and Jeff on the culture at Shadow Lion, the ability to go into work every day and never have the Sunday scaries, to support your teammates and treat everybody with respect is something that I think  is rare. It doesn’t really matter who came up with the idea. For us, ego is the enemy and our goal is to create a space for creatives to thrive.\n\nWhat do you see for the future of the company?\n\nHaas: We’re super excited about for what’s to come. I outlined the three buckets for us, as far as what we do between original content production and agency work. What we’re really excited about is to scale all three of those and maintain the quality of work. We have some fun and exciting opportunities on the agency side that we’re really excited about to continue to grow that team. We look at the scripted space as an opportunity that we’re excited to dip our toes into next year, and the audio space is a big one that we plan to make a move into toward the end of this year as well. \n\n\t[Internally], it’s to continue to build a space for creative talent and people to come and flex their muscles and maybe skip some rungs in the ladder and produce really great quality content at a high level and not necessarily have to go through the bureaucratic process that some legacy agencies or bigger companies might have as part of their formal process. We’re excited to open new locations in new cities and hopefully appeal to talent in those locations. The goal is really for us to grow our team, maintain our culture, maintain our quality and continue to cement Shadow Lion as a brand known for quality storytelling, quality content, quality creative and quality people.\n\nIs there anything else about Shadow Lion that you really want people to know right now?\n\nFine: One note just to build on what Gilad was talking about; I think from the very beginning we’ve seen this as a space for people and for creatives to thrive and grow. It’s not lost on us how fortunate we are to get the opportunity to create and have our work seen. We’re all sports fans since we were younger, and to be able to put out content with Tom, for instance, around some of these amazing moments that are just so emotional and wonderful is an amazing opportunity. \n\n\tSomething we realized early on, or at least I know I felt, was that any of my friends could be doing what I’m doing right now. They just don’t necessarily have the opportunity, and I think that runs through a lot of what we do. We feel like people can, if given the opportunity, really put out amazing work. Putting people in positions to succeed and have opportunities to do their best work, and the support system to do it, is central to everything we do. Some of my proudest feelings around the company are seeing how the people here have grown in just the last few years and thinking about the trajectory of that growth. It happens with every project and we’re constantly making bets on ourselves that are a little outside of our comfort zone because we believe we can do it. That’s always paid off for us because we believe we can rise to the occasion and we tend to. More people can do this type of work than tend to get the opportunities, and it’s cool to have the opportunity to do so.\n\nInterview edited for length and clarity.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Aside from its market-oriented aspect, MIA aims to be, first and foremost, a place where the most influential people in the audiovisual sector can meet.  \n\n\tThe goal for this year’s edition, which opened on Monday and runs through Friday, Oct. 13, is to expand the scope and increase the event’s range and offerings.\n\n\n\n\tAs per usual, content is the starting point. For this reason, further visibility and resources have been allotted to the MIA XR section that explores and delves into the technological innovations in the movie and TV industries, ranging from special effects to virtual reality. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCapri, Hollywood Film Fest: Italian Oscar Entry 'Io Capitano,' About African Migrants, to Receive Humanitarian Award\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGuillermo del Toro Confirms He Was Working on a Now-Scrapped 'Star Wars' Movie About Jabba the Hutt\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe same vision to enrich and enhance the content offered has been extended to the animation subdivision, which launched last year with success. “We wanted to try and explore the creative possibilities that technology can give producers,” said MIA Market director Gaia Tridente.\n\n\tFramed by the historic Palazzo Barberini in Rome where the MIA Market found its home, between the VR installations, the various set-ups and historical rooms, the space is truly impressive even at first glance. Guests welcomed this year in this space dedicated to technology include Marvel VFX supervisor Jake Morrison. \n\n\tIn addition to putting a spotlight on the future, Tridente emphasized that it was also important to stick to the path traced in previous editions, maintaining the market’s four pillars: movies, dramas, animation and documentaries.\n\n\tWhat is new for this year’s edition? Among other things, an attempt to introduce proper forums dedicated to factual entertainment. Another fundamental aspect this year will be the MIA Buyers’ Club, focused on movie distribution in theaters. Plus, a new subdivision dedicated to projects in development, “Comin’ Up,” will be introduced. Here, Tridente said the attempt will be made to predict what projects are going to be completed and distributed in the months following the event.\n\n\tCo-produced projects will likewise receive much visibility and focus, thanks to an entire dedicated floor within Palazzo Barberini. Many of this year’s main guests are seasoned female producers, such as Nicole Clemens from Paramount and Marge Dean from Skybound Entertainment. Representatives from the Scandinavian, Spanish and Italian markets will also discuss European productions for Netflix.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“This is the embodiment of MIA Market: paying attention to the present as well as the future,” emphasized Tridente. For this reason, she explained, even smaller players from all over the world will be given considerable space. “We want to represent the whole world,” she highlighted. \n\n\tAnimation in particular is going to be one of the key content areas in focus. “When we launched our subdivision last year, we wanted to explore this form of expression in its entirety, first of all,” said Tridente. “And I believe we’ve succeeded in engaging the most important players. The future of animation is going to be essential for the growth of the entire industry.”\n\n\tThe Hollywood strikes involving screenwriters and actors have not, she says, affected this year’s planning. “We hope that these issues will be solved soon and that the value of all workers in this industry will be acknowledged. MIA Market is not a festival, therefore it wasn’t undermined by these events,” explained Tridente. \n\n\tAnd she emphasized that the 2023 edition of the MIA Market will continue to push its international reach and flair, facilitating encounters amongst all sorts of parties, and not merely with Italian producers and institutions.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Del Toro was working on the project with screenwriter David S. Goyer, who first teased the news last month on the Happy Sad Confused podcast.\n\n\t“There was just a lot of behind [the scenes] stuff going on at Lucasfilm at the time,” Goyer said on the podcast. “But it’s a cool script.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCapri, Hollywood Film Fest: Italian Oscar Entry 'Io Capitano,' About African Migrants, to Receive Humanitarian Award\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney's 'Moving' Sweeps Busan Film Festival's Asia Contents Awards \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn response, Del Toro tweeted at the time: “True.

Sometimes I’m bitter, sometimes I’m not. I always turn to my team and say, ‘Good practice, guys. Good practice. We designed a great world. We designed great stuff.

Del Toro, though, has no hard feelings.\n\n\t“You can never be ungrateful with life,” he said. “Whatever life sends you, there’s something to be learned from it. So, you know, I trust the universe, I do. When something doesn’t happen, I go, ‘Why?’ I try to have a dialogue with myself. ‘Why didn’t it happen?’ And the more you swim upstream with the universe, the less you’re gonna realize where you’re going.”\n\n\tWhile it’s unclear exactly how long ago Del Toro and Goyer were working on the project, not getting a chance to direct a Star Wars movie obviously hasn’t hindered Del Toro’s career: He’s won three Oscars, two for The Shape of Water (best picture and best director) and one for Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio (best animated feature). For his part, Goyer has been involved with numerous superhero films, including The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice along with Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJabba, meanwhile, has appeared in several Star Wars movies and on TV. He was first introduced in 1983’s Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi. He also was later added to Star Wars: Episode IV – a New Hope when the film was rereleased for its 20th anniversary in 1997, via a previously unfinished scene. The character appeared again in 1999’s Star Wars: Episode I – the Phantom Menace.\n\n\tJabba also is a key part of the storyline for the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars and appears in several episodes of the TV series that followed.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

He graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1982 and received his bachelor’s degree in hospitality management from Florida International University in 1984. The chef opened his first restaurant, Toby’s, in Miami. The following year, he was named Chef of the Year by Food & Wine magazine. \n\n\tHe returned to California in 1986, where he helped open Tra Vigne Restaurant in Napa Valley. Over the course of his career, he also opened restaurants like Bottega and Ottimo. Carrie Underwood praised Bottega, telling The Hollywood Reporter in 2018 that it was her “happy place.” Judy Greer also expressed her appreciation for the restaurant, noting it had the best “carbs to soak up the wine.” \n\n\t“Chef Michael Chiarello’s passion for food and life will forever be etched in our kitchens and our hearts. While we mourn Michael’s passing, we also celebrate his legacy that continues with his restaurants, Bottega, Coqueta (San Francisco and Napa Valley) and Ottimo,” his longtime partners in Gruppo Chiarello said in a statement. “In remembrance, we ask that you join us in celebrating his remarkable journey and the incredible impact he had on the world of food, wine and family by inviting you to share a meal with your family and friends to remind all of us that the bonds forged over a meal are among life’s most precious treasures.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
