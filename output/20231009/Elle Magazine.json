{"title": "What We Learned from Stephanie Grisham's Trump Tell-All, <i>I'll Take Your Questions Now</i>", "date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nIn her new book, Stephanie Grisham reveals a peek behind the scenes of the Trump White House, “where everything was like a clown car on fire running at full speed into a warehouse of fireworks.”\nAnother day, another Trumpworld memoir. The latest damning dispatch from the Trump Administration comes courtesy of Stephanie Grisham, who served various roles in the White House throughout a four-year period: communications director and press secretary in the West Wing, as well as communications director and chief of staff in Melania Trump’s East Wing. In I’ll Take Your Questions Now, her new memoir, Grisham depicts a White House “where everything was like a clown car on fire running at full speed into a warehouse of fireworks.” Caught between the president’s abusive leadership style and the conflicting loyalties she felt toward the first lady, Grisham’s final straw came on January 6, 2021, when she tendered her resignation hours into the insurrection at the Capitol. \nThe Trumps, for their part, have already moved to discredit Grisham. Describing Grisham as “very angry and bitter” after a break-up, President Trump said in a statement, “Stephanie didn’t have what it takes and that was obvious from the beginning. She had big problems and we felt that she should work out those problems for herself. Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.” Melania Trump also clapped back, saying in a statement, \"The author is desperately trying to rehabilitate her tarnished reputation by manipulating and distorting the truth about Mrs. Trump. Ms. Grisham is a deceitful and troubled individual who doesn’t deserve anyone’s trust.\"\nGrisham’s account, like any Trumpworld memoir, must be read with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, as Grisham herself admits, “Casual dishonesty filtered through the White House as though it were in the air conditioning system.” But Grisham anticipates that readers may not take her account at face value, writing, “This is not, by the way, a book where you need to like me.” We read I’ll Take Your Questions Now in advance of publication; now, we’re breaking down the biggest bombshells below.\nFirst up: Grisham offers insight into the daily routines of the first lady, and the derisive nickname they inspired:\nAccording to Grisham, there was no lost love between Melania Trump and her stepchildren, particularly Ivanka Trump:\nInappropriate behavior on the part of the Kushners earned the couple their own derisive nickname. “Because they dabbled in a bit of everything and could be precocious and self-absorbed, we in the East Wing dubbed [the Kushners] ‘the interns,’” Grisham writes. “Mrs. Trump was amused and herself used the nickname every now and then.” Tension between the East Wing and the Kushners is an enduring theme throughout the book, with Grisham continually emphasizing the conflicts of interest proposed by the Kushners’ role in the administration.  Take, for example, the matter of Jared Kushner’s security clearance:\nRemembering when Kushner teamed up with speechwriter Stephen Miller to write a televised address at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Grisham writes at length about what she saw as Kushner’s poisonous influence in the White House:\nBut the Kushners aren’t the only Trumpworld acolytes to come under fire in I’ll Take Your Questions Now. Grisham doesn’t mince words when writing about Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham:\nGrisham, like many other Trumpworld alums, takes note of Trump’s obsession with dictators. But it’s her recollection of 2019’s G20 Summit in Osaka that’s the most chilling, suggesting an all-too cozy rapport between Trump and Vladimir Putin:\nThe most interesting moments in I'll Take Your Questions Now come when Grisham offers a look behind the scenes of memorable moments. Take, for example, her recollections about the hand slap heard ‘round the world. In 2017, Melania Trump made headlines when she appeared to slap her husband’s hand away during a diplomatic visit to Saudi Arabia in 2017. The truth, according to Grisham, is less interesting:\nGrisham also delves into the Stormy Daniels scandal from 2018, remembering when Daniels sued Donald Trump over his efforts to suppress her disclosure of their affair. In the ensuing media blitz, Daniels likened Trump’s penis to a toadstool—a depiction he took such issue with that he called Grisham from Air Force One to set the record straight. \nRemember Trump's mysterious visit to Walter Reed Medical Center in 2019, when protocol was disrupted and doctors were asked to sign NDAs? Grisham takes us behind the scenes there, too. \nBut we know the real behind-the-scenes story you want to know about: behind the scenes of Trump's haircare routine. Grisham has got you covered:\nThat’s all for now, dear reader. We’ll see you next time there's a Trumpworld memoir to excavate, which surely won’t be long. \nAdrienne Westenfeld is the Books and Fiction Editor at Esquire, where she oversees books coverage, edits fiction, and curates the Esquire Book Club. \nIsrael-Palestine: How to Help the Victims of War\nAll the Celebrity Break Ups In 2023 (So Far)\nAll About Dalton Gomez, Ariana’s Ex-Husband\nA Timeline of Taylor and Travis’ Whirlwind Romance\nSarah Jessica Parker & Matthew Broderick Timeline\nA Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Love\nAll About Taylor Lautner's Wife Taylor Dome\nCiara and Russell Wilson's Relationship Timeline\nKhloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson's Romance\nRami Malek and Emma Corrin’s Relationship Timeline\nKendall Jenner Joins Bad Bunny in Miami\nLindsay Lohan Makes ‘Mean Girls’ Commercial\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "11 Indigenous Designers to Support on Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Always", "date": "2023-10-09 13:22:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThis month, we celebrate and honor Native American people and commemorate their histories and cultures. But the time to support Indigenous artists is year-round. Sustainability and tradition are often at the forefront of Indigenous design, whether it’s the way Keri Ataumbi  uses visual storytelling in her jewelry or the history behind Jamie Gentry’s bespoke moccasin boutique. For Amy Denet Deal of 4KINSHIP, creativity is also about telling Indigenous stories, which have so often been misunderstood or not told at all. “I want people to know we are limitless,” she says. “Our creativity has been highly coveted by the fashion industry, and for decades has been appropriated. It’s our time to step into the fashion space to tell our own stories and present our own creative visions ourselves.”  \nBy uplifting Indigenous, Native American, and First Nation-owned brands, you help grow small businesses, spread inclusivity, and encourage authentic art. “There is such a pan-indigenous view of native people, yet we are over 574 different tribes, so there is certainly not just one point of view,” Denet Deal says. We hope to see more and more of these talented visionaries sharing their perspectives in the years to come. For now, here are 11 designers to support this Indigenous Peoples’ Day—and always. \nKorina Emmerich descends from a long line of Coast Salish Territory fisherman on her father’s side, and her designs for EMME Studio often reflect that legacy. She is known for crafting beautiful jackets and shirts in bright sunset and oceanic colors, and in patterns that pay homage to the sacred relationship between humans and animals. Celebrities and politicians like Deb Haaland have worn Emmerich’s designs, and one of her creations, a wool skirt and coat, was even featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” exhibit. At the height of the pandemic, Emmerich used her sartorial skills to help her community by crafting hundreds of face masks in traditional patterns and hues. “[Indigenous] masks can carry heavy ceremonial responsibilities in recovery and healing,” Emmerich told ELLE at the time. “Everything created is meant to be used and masks help share traditional teachings in a sort of theatrical way.”\nLauren Good Day, an Arikara-Hidatsa-Blackfeet-Plains-Cree designer, learned beadwork from her mother as a child. She then took that passion for art and traditional design and incorporated it into her eponymous contemporary clothing brand, which is known worldwide for its bright unisex graphic tees, hoodies, and pants. Her latest collection honors the “aesthetic of the flourishing Northern Plains” and features traditional floral and elk patterns in bright colors.\nGrowing up on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, Keri Ataumbi developed a love for contemporary Native American design at an early age. The Kiowa fine jeweler categorizes her work as “wearable art,” because it incorporates conceptual narrative and often features juxtaposing materials. “In the Western world, there’s been a real separation in terms of what’s art and what isn’t art,” she said in an interview. “There’s not an integrated feeling about jewelry, that jewelry is actually art and can have all the same stories and potency that a painting does.”  \nRenowned beadworker Jamie Okuma is thoughtful and eco-conscious when she comes up with her luxury designs—which often incorporate intricate patterns of florals and animals. Okuma—who is Luiseño, Shoshone-Bannock, Wailaki, and Okinawan—keeps production quantity relatively low in order to avoid overstock. “We all have those go-to pieces in our closet that we keep for years and literally wear out before we retire them,” she said in an interview. “I’m here to make the go-tos, the keepers.”\nLesley Hampton, who landed a spot on ELLE Canada’s list of designers to watch, credits her Anishinaabe and Mohawk heritage for shaping her work. Hampton’s sleek designs, which bring to light issues like mental health via phrases and sayings emblazoned on them, have been spotted on runways and red carpets (Lizzo is a fan). But that’s not why Hampton got into fashion. “I’ve been doing a lot of growing up and discovering my Indigeneity,” she told ELLE Canada. “I use the collection as a catalyst for figuring out my identity. Being able to present that with beautiful garments on the runway is just a bonus.”\nJamie Gentry is from the Kwakwaka’wakw Nation, and grew up immersed in a world full of traditional culture and art—particularly sewing, beading, and weaving. She took that deep-rooted passion for all things handmade and turned it into a bona fide bespoke moccasin-making business. Each pair is custom-made and, Gentry says on her site, says “infused with love.”\nAs a teenager, Tania Larsson immersed herself in her Gwich’in culture—teaching herself how to make traditional jewelry and beaded garments. She found a mentor in Ataumbi, featured above on this list. After apprenticing under the designer for two years, Larsson began making her own beautiful jewelry under her brand Gwich’in Fine Jewellery, which she described in an interview as “a conduit that creates connections between the land, animals, elders, hunters, community members, and the wearer.” \nFast fashion didn’t suit artistic designer Amy Denet Deal. So in 2018, she left her corporate fashion job in Los Angeles and headed to New Mexico. Inspired by the sense of sustainability of her native Navajo community, Deal launched 4KINSHIP as a woman-led “artwear” brand focused on upcycling and producing one-of-a-kind clothing and accessories and uplifting Indigenous communities, particularly those in the Southwest where 4KINSHIP is based. She also founded the 4KINSHIP Indigenous Futures Fund to help incubate emerging talents and encourage Native creativity and expression. \nThunderVoice Hat Co. is one of Denet Deal’s personal favorites for its “exquisite upcycled luxury products.” ThunderVoice does offer an array of high-end hats and jewelry, but you can also find a wide variety of smaller items that would be perfect for gifting, like stickers, pins, and fanny packs. One thing that is particularly special at TVHC is the art. You can find classic works like “Girl With a Pearl Earring”  and “American Gothic” reimagined through a Native American lens. The results are stunning. \nThere’s only one Indigenous denim brand in the entire world—one!—and it’s Ginew. This brand takes modern Native American style and adds inflections of Ojibwe, Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee motifs. All of Ginew’s apparel and goods are made of the highest quality and with the utmost care and tradition. All leather goods are made with pre-industrial techniques informed by generations of craftsmanship.  \nFrom northern Arizona’s Diné (Navajo) people, comes Di’Orr Greenwood. Greenwood specializes in hand making bespoke wooden flutes, skateboard decks, and longboards. Her designs are colorful and, more importantly, meaningful. “Any art that comes from me is definitely ancestral based,” she said in a Navajo Times interview. “It’s more of a feeling.” Themes and symbols Greenwood incorporates include the four directions, elements, mountains, and the seasons. \nRose is a Senior Editor at ELLE overseeing features and projects about women's issues. She is an accomplished and compassionate storyteller and editor who excels in obtaining exclusive interviews and unearthing compelling features. \n \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions. She also co-writes a monthly column, Same Same But Different. Meg has previously written for Cosmopolitan and Town & Country. Her passions include travel, buffalo sauce, and sustainability.

{"title": "Pisces Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:11", "text": "(February 19 - March 20)\nYour friends and colleagues are your lifeline, but signals (and connections) may have been strained over the past five months as intensifying Pluto idled in a frustrating retrograde through your eleventh house of teamwork and technology (since May 1). But on Tuesday, October 10, the cathartic planet resumes forward movement, bringing more clarity and stability to your social life. (This can also clear up some of those mysterious tech issues you’ve experienced!) You’ll feel more connected to your inner circle and might want to get to know a co-worker better. Part of Pluto’s “curriculum” has been to show you, firsthand, who you do—and DON’T—have the time or energy for anymore. The eleventh house rules all kinds of groups and communities, and if you’ve been dabbling on the sidelines with one or a few special-interest groups, take a leap of faith and get more involved. As you feel your way into different organizations, it won’t take long to know whether you’re ready to commit to full-fledged membership or not.\nA heavy emotional weight begins to lift this Thursday as activator Mars pulls up stakes in Libra and your eighth house of secrets, seduction and jealousy, where it’s been since August 27, and charges into Scorpio and your liberated, expansive ninth house until November 24. Scorpio is a fellow water sign, and it’s co-ruled by Mars, so these next six weeks could be intense. Motivated Mars in this unrepressed zone can help you shake off any gloomy or negative feelings of the past month and a half. If possessiveness or distrust have been holding you back, you may find a new lightness around your heart center. Since the ninth house also rules travel, foreign cultures and higher education, interactions with different types of people will be especially stimulating for you over the next six weeks. Don’t be surprised if you’re drawn to folks from very different backgrounds or whose lifestyles are wildly divergent from yours. That’s what makes life interesting—and creates chemistry! If you’re in a committed union, you can spark a romantic revival by adding more adventure to your life. Challenge yourself (safely) with a hiking trip, an adventure-themed getaway or by enrolling in a month-long boot camp—together. Or take the same week off from work and plan a super-fun staycation, with each of you planning little surprises for the other.\nBoth of the week’s major themes—transformation and relationship—get supercharged on Saturday, courtesy of an annular “ring of fire” solar eclipse/new moon in Libra and your eighth house of metaphysics and intimacy. While you may not have been able to articulate it, you’ve had a growing sense that a certain area of your life was in need of a deep change. This new eclipse cycle, on the Aries-Libra axis, began last April 20 (and is in effect until March 29, 2025), and you might have been feeling the rumblings. And shifts are imminent! Over the next two weeks, as the moon wanes, you’ll have increasingly clearer glimpses of what needs your attention—and HOW you can initiate or accelerate the process. Be patient with yourself, Pisces. Eclipses’ sphere of influence lasts six months, so give yourself time to do the slow, lasting work that will support your big decision. And since the eighth house rules shared resources, a fringe benefit of all your inner work could be taking a committed next step with bae… or meeting someone with the potential for permabonding.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Aquarius Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:10", "text": "(January 20 - February 18)\nUntil this Tuesday, October 10, you may not have realized just how deeply and intensely buried emotions, old wounds and unresolved issues have been affecting you, Water Bearer. But this week, one of the main instigators of that, alchemist Pluto, wraps up an unnerving five-month retrograde through your twelfth house of the unconscious, healing and mysticism. Now that the cathartic dwarf planet is back in forward motion, you’re ready to finish the curriculum, learn the big lessons, and release any resentment, grief or pain. But make sure you’ve become conversant with what those feelings are and how they function inside your psyche. If you’ve been doing ANY kind of inner process work—psychological, spiritual or around addiction—you’re already way ahead of the game. And for Aquarians who are hesitant (or straight-up resistant) to “going there,” remember that whatever you tell yourself, you’ve still got a powerful metaphysical side. And as Pluto gains momentum and pushes full steam ahead, you could find yourself open to some very different ideas—and people. Don’t be surprised if boundaries blur or you’re suddenly willing to ease up a bit on any death-grip control.\nWork is a perfect arena to channel this renewed energy starting on Thursday, when action planet Mars charges into Scorpio and your tenth house of success until November 24. While others are off leaf-peeping and apple-picking, you’re just getting going on a major project. Set your sights on the juiciest goal you’ve been dreaming of while Pluto was retrograde and map out your first key steps. You won’t have to twist any arms or cajole anyone into teaming up with you: Your work ethic, talent and innovative style will make you a force to be reckoned with over the coming six weeks. If you’ve been eyeing a leadership position, let the appropriate decision-makers know. On the other hand, if you’re not happy with your current gig, double down on your job-searching efforts—discreetly! Stand out from the pack by putting personal touches on your resume, portfolio, reel or professional profiles to make them memorable. If you’re an entrepreneur, this is a perfect time to invest in the business by expanding PR, marketing or online advertising.\nGet as much momentum going as you can right out of the gate, Aquarius, because Saturday’s annular “ring of fire” solar eclipse/new moon in Libra activates your ninth house of global adventures, which could bring your simmering wanderlust to a full boil. While it’s great to have your professional mojo back, there’s another side of you that can’t keep away from travel blogs and hunting for last-minute deals. Where have you been fantasizing about? Which far-flung friend has been trying to lure you to their neck of the woods? These next few weeks are an auspicious time for doing anything expansive, so even if you can’t book a trip now, you can scratch that travel itch by planning it or simply engaging in cross-cultural connections. Eclipses reveal what’s hiding in the shadows, so be careful what you wish for. With this eclipse cycle in effect from April 20, 2023, to March 29, 2025, your independent spirit needs room to roam. An essential component is being honest about your needs and desires. So if something’s not sitting right with you, swallow the truth serum and broach the tough topic within two weeks of the eclipse. You can’t change the status quo until you confront it directly.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a. The AstroTwins) are ELLE.com’s resident astrologers.

{"title": "Capricorn Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:10", "text": "(December 22 - January 19)\nReady, set, exhale! Finally, after five frustrating months, cathartic Pluto ends its retrograde and resumes forward motion in your sign on Tuesday, October 10. Since May 1, you may have felt like someone (or something) was personally out to slow you down or hold you back, but that’s about to change immediately! Even if you got in a rut and have been spinning your wheels, you can thrust ahead and quickly gain momentum by boldly stepping into your power and being seen and heard. Your gusto will be infectious and help you make up for what seems like lost time. As things pick up speed and begin to soar over the next seven months, continually check in with yourself to make sure you’re acting authentically from the heart. You’ll have to shed any emotional armor you acquired during Pluto’s retrograde, even when you feel vulnerable. But ultimately, that’s a sign NOT of weakness but of strength and confidence. And with direct-moving Pluto in your corner, you have the secret ingredient for success!\nThe same week that Pluto corrects course, Mars does a “costume change” of its own, exiting Libra and your professional sector and marching into Scorpio and your eleventh house of group activities until November 24. Part of you is happiest (and feels safest) working on your own. But because you probably won’t always be able to work solo, it’s important to sharpen your interpersonal communication skills for when you are part of a team. Mars and Pluto co-rule Scorpio, and their mutual moves can highlight themes of power, cooperation and the need to align over shared values. Over the next six weeks, you can become more adept at navigating what might be a minefield. First: Do an attitude assessment. If you have a belief (conscious or not) that working with others requires you to give up your personal power, stop right there and reframe it so you can focus on the strength—and talent pool—that’s found in numbers. No one excels at everything, Capricorn, and where you’re a little weak, someone else might be a rock star, and their knowledge and expertise can actually make YOU smarter! You may have to share the glory, but there’s more than enough to go around!\nAnd speaking of kudos… Saturday’s annular “ring of fire” solar eclipse/new moon in your career corner could bring rapid—and highly visible—developments at work, your favorite kind! Now, to reach that next level of success you may have to stretch and pivot in new ways and at a more rapid pace than you’re used to. But that’s what “advancement” is all about! You’ve got major eclipse mojo working for you, so trust the process, be ready to act and resist the default “overthinking” that comes with Capricorn territory. Assume that a plum opportunity is waiting for you. Dress for success—i.e., the job you WANT to have—and self-promote on social media, set up power lunches and conference calls, and let your voice be heard in meetings. Shoptalk isn’t restricted to the office or “9-5,” either. You could have a serendipitous meeting with a stranger who turns out to be the perfect connection for your career. But you won’t find out if you don’t stick your neck out a bit!\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a. The AstroTwins) are ELLE.com’s resident astrologers.

{"title": "Sagittarius Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:09", "text": "(November 22 - December 21)\nIf you’ve struggled to keep your head above water for the past five months—or sunk into a sea of debt—the universe throws you a lifeline this week. (Or at least you’ll find it easier to stay afloat.) This Tuesday, October 10, shadowy Pluto resumes forward motion after a long, frustrating retrograde through your financial zone. But don’t expect money to fall out of the sky. You still have to do your bit, and right now is the perfect moment to re-commit to managing your cash flow in a more positive way while also finding a way to boost your bottom line. Do a little “damage assessment,” Sag: Are you underpaid and underappreciated and ready to start earning what you deserve? You know what you’re worth, but it can be daunting to try to persuade the people who sign your paycheck to bump up your pay. But if you “can’t” and they “won’t,” then it’s time to start hunting for a new job. Pluto will gain momentum as it marches forward over these next seven months, meaning it’s your job to make yourself indispensable and irreplaceable. (Of course, no one needs to know you’re discreetly circulating your resume at the same time.) While your indie-spirited sign isn’t generally a fan of following rules, you can—and should—be working the Law of Attraction!\nKeep your motivation high even when your energy dips. That may be the case starting this Thursday as go-getter Mars slips out of your social sector and under the covers in your internally focused twelfth house until November 24. Every other year, the action planet goes underground for six or seven weeks, and that can induce YOU to go off the radar. That may or may not be possible, but honor the urge by giving yourself plenty of downtime by day, and allowing extra dreamtime by night since the twelfth house is where you receive divine downloads. When you’re not in the mood to be social, don’t force yourself—and don’t let anyone guilt-trip you into doing what doesn’t feel right. Trust the process! Since this realm is also associated with closure, release and transitions, you may finally be ready to quit a bad habit—or a toxic relationship. Get the support you need by surrounding yourself with positive people and maybe working with a therapist or coach. By resting, recharging and healing, you’ll come out more creatively inspired than ever, more than ready for Mars-in-Sag season on November 24.\nEven when you’re on your personal retreat, you’ll want to reach out to your inner circle. But this introspective period might have you reconsidering certain members (er, hangers-on?) in your social network. On Saturday, an annular (“ring of fire”) solar eclipse/new moon in Libra—the first one in this sign since 2016—turns the spotlight on your eleventh house of group activity. As a Sagittarius, you can’t help but draw the eclectic people wherever you go, but not all of them deserve your time and attention. Solar eclipses are like new moons on steroids, so there could be some radical new beginnings with your squad mates. “Pruning your garden” is one thing, but if you pool your talents and resources, what exciting venture might some of you create as a collab? Assemble your dream team or plan an event where you can play superconnector and bring everyone together. Eclipses reveal hidden opportunities, and since this one lands in your tech sector, you could serendipitously meet a new collaborator through social media.

{"title": "Scorpio Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:09", "text": "(October 23 - November 21)\nHave you been trying to read the tea leaves, Scorpio, only to be stuck attempting to decode all kinds of cryptic messages and ambiguous subtexts? You can let that go on Tuesday, October 10, as transformational Pluto—your cosmic co-ruler—ends a frustrating five-month retrograde in your third house of communication. As the mighty dwarf planet resumes forward motion, you’ll be back to your old incisive self, able to read people without said tea leaves or coffee grounds or even a divination deck. Better yet? The gift of this Plutonian dive into the underworld (i.e., reverse pivot) is that you may have a stronger and clearer message to share, AND you may finally have found the confidence to shout it from the rooftops (or perhaps your social media channels). While you’re at it, how about cherry-picking a few select people and inviting them into your inner sanctum? Trust can be challenging for many Scorpios, but the number one way to get over that is to open up to a few people who’ve shown their loyalty and responsibility, and mutually proving that you have each other’s backs.\nOn Thursday, you might not be able to hold yourself back from blasting ahead. This star-powered day has been two years in the making! Your OTHER co-ruler, go-getter Mars, busts out of the private twelfth-house chrysalis it’s been since August 27 and charges into your sign until November 24. As Mars returns to Scorpio, you’ll experience an energizing burst of motivation, which will supercharge your ambitions and fill you with can-do spirit for the next six weeks. Mars only comes around every two years, but when he marches through your sign, you WILL feel it! Forget hiding out in the shadows, like you may have done while Mars was holed up in your introspective twelfth house. Now’s the time to step off the sidelines and get 100 percent back in the game. Good luck trying hide that legendary Scorpio charisma and animal magnetism. Just one word of caution: Stay mindful of where you’re aiming your beams. It could be easier to draw someone in than disconnect from them when you’re ready to move on.\nBut leave plenty of white space in your calendar, Scorpio. Saturday’s annular (“ring of fire”) solar eclipse/new moon in Libra powers up your twelfth house of endings and transitions, unofficially dubbing this your “sweet surrender” time. You’re not a big fan of “letting to,” but this is a rare and potent opportunity to loosen up your death grip on the control panel and yield to—or set an intention to co-create with—a higher force. You might feel righteously indignant at someone, but hanging onto anger or resentment only hurts YOU. While you may never condone or accept their actions, forgiveness is always an option—and it’s one of the most important steps to true healing and lasting change. This is a great time to focus on strengthening your sense of self and establishing firmer boundaries, which support all future relationships. And you don’t have to DIY! Work with a coach or therapist or find a simpatico support group to help you move past any grief, anxiety or fear. Easy it’s not, but the payoff could literally change your life during this eclipse cycle, which is galvanizing the Aries-Libra axis from April 20, 2023, until March 29, 2025.

{"title": "Libra Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:08", "text": "(September 23 - October 22)\nIf “confusion and chaos” has been a more accurate description of your domestic life than “home sweet home” over the past five months, get ready for a major sea change. This Tuesday, October 10, radical Pluto wraps up the retrograde in your fourth house of home and family that began May 1. This may explain why things on the Libra home front have been anything but calm and even-tempered. Roommates, relatives, children and even landlords have taken turns acting disruptively, the cumulative effect of which may have sent you into a frustration spiral. But now, with Pluto’s course correction, it’s safe to come out of hiding. And auspicious timing because you may have a big decision looming around home, family and where you live. Just lean into your natural Libran quest for balance and you’ll find a harmonious solution to any problem. Even if your domestic life has been serene, relations with a certain relative may have gotten strained. With Pluto back to forward motion, you’ll have the perfect opening to extend an olive branch—AND proactively get some stricter boundaries in place!\nThursday’s skies bring more good news—specifically a boon for your bottom line! Things will start to look up, fiscally speaking, from now until November 24, as hard-driving Mars races through Scorpio and your second house of money and security. This monetary uptick is welcome news, even if it means the enlivening red planet is leaving your sign for another two years. You’ve been hosting Mars since August 27, which has been energizing AND nerve-racking since the competitive warrior planet isn’t at his most comfortable in your cooperative, peace-loving sign. Hopefully you got the kind of motivational jolt you need to move into this next revenue-boosting phase. Now, as Mars enters his home sign of Scorpio, you’ll be in a position to come up with a practical plan for last month’s brainstorms. But pace yourself, Libra. Mars’ M.O. is to come on strong and act impulsively, which could lead you to do things you could regret later. Be sure to keep a mindful eye on your spending, which can balloon out of control with Mars at the helm.\nOn Saturday, a “ring of fire” (annular) solar eclipse/new moon in Libra sounds the starting bell for a new beginning…on anything your heart desires! But take note: You may have to come crawling out from behind the scenes and step into the spotlight. Dust yourself off and get used to it. This is the first eclipse to activate your sign since 2016! And while it might feel like the ground’s moving beneath your feet, that might be exactly what it takes to put yourself out there again. It’s not an ego trip, Libra—at least, it doesn’t HAVE to be. (And knowing you, it won’t be.) Think of it this way: By sharing your progress and accomplishments, you can inspire others to work harder on THEIRS. Make this an integral part of your message. When you’re promoting your offerings, emphasize the benefits for other people. As your partnership-oriented sign knows well, the best things in life are always mutual.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Virgo Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:08", "text": "(August 23 - September 22)\nHit the reset button on your love life, Virgo! This Tuesday, October 10, transformative Pluto resumes forward motion in your fifth house of passion, fame and amour after five frustrating months of idling in neutral there. But as that annoying retrograde comes to an end and the penetrating dwarf planet blasts ahead, you won’t be deterred by the speed bumps and potholes that have slowed your roll since May 1. Some Virgos may still be a little nauseous from that emotional roller-coaster ride. But now, with Pluto back on track, you can recalibrate your romantic radar. Set an intention for what kind of partner or upgraded relationship you want to manifest this year. You may need to step outside your comfort zone and experiment with new approaches to meeting prospects, whether that means trying a new dating app or asking friends to make introductions. Should you go that route, be more open-minded about your pursuits. Screen carefully and with typical Virgo discernment, but give the “maybes” more of a fighting chance. Couples can revive their vibe by exploring some new terrain, whether in a couples’ massage class or a sexy beach getaway.\nIf you’re single, don’t categorically rule out ALL platonic connections as potentials. On Thursday, seductive Mars blasts into hot-blooded Scorpio and your third house of local friends and community until November 24, putting you in fine flirting form. This gives you a bone-deep confidence to go after what your heart desires. Deal with any remnants of self-consciousness or guilt that come up—assuming they’re misbegotten! We realize that not all Virgos are comfortable articulating romantic interest, so lean into your natural superpowers of keen observation and a quick wit. But don’t get carried away by leading someone on who you’re not into in, and by all means, steer clear of too-easy snark and sarcasm. (A double risk with hotheaded Mars in the picture.) Get 100 percent clear on the difference between teasing and being mean, and stop far short of crossing that line. With your communicative third house activated, your Virgo mind will be razor-sharp, making this a great time for any writing, media or teaching projects.\nThe universe wants to show YOU the money this Saturday as the annular (“ring of fire”) solar eclipse/new moon in Libra electrifies your second house of money. If you’ve been waiting for news on a big pitch or job offer, be ready to pounce. Your phone could start blowing up with promising opportunities for big paydays now or over the next two weeks (peak manifesting time). Eclipses reveal what’s been hidden—sometimes in plain sight. If you haven’t been happy with the status quo, start poking around in the shadows! Should something new come your way, don’t worry about not acing it on first try—a tendency of your perfectionistic sign. Just say yes, be patient (easy for your humble sign) and plan to learn on the job. This fiscally auspicious eclipse gives you the nerve to raise your rate or request a pay increase, so get a meeting on the books with the folks who sign your paycheck.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(July 23 - August 22)\nHas the wellness wagon passed you by…again? Don’t despair, Leo. You may finally be ready to hop aboard! After five unnerving months spinning retrograde in your sixth house of healthy living, organization and service, transformational Pluto resumes forward motion this Tuesday, October 10. Whether you were idling in neutral or slipping into old habits, the place to start is by accepting wherever you’re at now and concocting a new game plan. But easy does it! You can’t go from full-on decadence to Olympian overnight. And make sure you’re being realistic about what your ultimate goal is. Not sure where to begin? Nutrition is always a good idea. Slow, steady steps in a greener direction will make you feel better, give you more energy and build momentum toward larger changes. Then commit to moving your body on a regular basis. Find exercise or movement classes that genuinely excite you—maybe a fun barre or dance-based workout? Pluto’s pivot forward also supports you in organizing your daily routines and streamlining your systems. If you know there are certain chores you always resist, for whatever reason, figure out if you can outsource them.\nLove to entertain? Then make sure Chez Leo is up to snuff because over the next six weeks, your lair could become a buzzing social hive. This Thursday, passionate Mars blasts into intense Scorpio and your domestic fourth house until November 24, turning up the heat on all home-based activities. And YOU get to decide what those functions will be. What do you need to do ASAP to get your place party-ready? Are you up for a major cleanup and decluttering mission? Restock the fridge and pantry, dust off your board games, download some appropriate playlists and go pull some cute cozy season ‘fits. On the plus side, Mars will motivate and energize you…but it can also churn up competitive and even aggressive vibes with some people. So the heads-up is to make a point of limiting your exposure to the divas and high-maintenance folks in your circle. If you’ve been considering a move, the red planet can spark a fire in your belly and keep it lit for six weeks. Speaking of keeping the home fires burning, lusty Mars intensifies your desire to play house with bae or, if you’re single, get serious about meeting someone. Don’t reflexively reject the “nice” guys or girls. They can be surprisingly hot when you get to know them.\nBut keep your guard up this weekend. Saturday’s annular (“ring of fire”) solar eclipse/new moon in Libra powers up your house of friendship, and since eclipses reveal hidden information, you could learn something unpleasant about a person you considered a BFF. This eclipse cycle—which is galvanizing the Aries-Libra axis from April 20, 2023, to March 29, 2025—might expose a fair-weather friend or opportunist. If you do discover something unsavory, don’t ignore it. Before you read anyone to filth, however, make sure you’ve got all the facts. Surprises aren’t always bad. You might find out that unbeknownst to you, someone has been going to bat on your behalf. This is also your realm of siblings, and over the next two weeks, you could resolve a long-standing issue with one of yours.

{"title": "Cancer Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:06", "text": "(June 21 - July 22)\nRelationship refresh! You may feel like your love life is catching a cosmic tailwind starting on Tuesday, October 10, and amen to that! Transformational Pluto resumes forward motion after a seemingly endless (but really just five-month) retrograde in your dynamic-duos sector. Some Crabs grappled with heavy issues, sending you down a frustrating rabbit hole. For others, an important relationship may have hit the skids, or you couldn’t figure out if a certain someone was worth moving forward with. Now, as Pluto straightens out, clarity and optimism will return, laying the tracks for progress in your partnerships. Whether you’re making some necessary adjustments or doing a hard reset, don’t underestimate the primacy of being totally honest about your needs—with other people AND yourself. HOW you communicate those desires is even more important. In a new situationship? Tap the brakes and don’t be too available. It’s not manipulative to slow down and let desire build. Anticipation makes the payoff that much sweeter!\nLending support on this front is passionate Mars, who blasts into intense Scorpio and your fifth house of romance, fame and creativity on Thursday for six weeks. Your prickly protective shell may be easily removed by the right person! From now until November 24, you’ll be the life of every party, turning heads wherever you strut. It’s a safe bet that your love life won’t lack for drama! This frame of mind may feel uncharacteristically forward, but whenever it does strike, you’re actually quite skillful at taking the lead. This makes it more essential that you know exactly what you’re looking for, whether a sizzling no-strings fling or a union with the potential to go the distance. And don’t forget to let the object of your affection know what’s in your heart. Watch out for Mars’ tendency to come on too strong. Candid and direct are fine, but maintain a modicum of mystery to keep them intrigued! If you’re an artist or performer, this is your cue to put yourself out there. This Martian power surge could get your name on the map before Thanksgiving!\nSave some energy and bandwidth for your kith and kin, though! Saturday’s annular “ring of fire” solar eclipse in Libra powers up your domestic fourth house and could signal some changes in your home environment. This is a new moon, and that monthly phase is associated with beginnings. Caveat: Decisions made under an eclipse tend to come with a “plot twist,” especially if you don’t peer around into the shadows, so really think through the worst-case scenarios. Have you been considering inviting a new roommate (or partner) into your lair? Maybe a relative needs more support—or LESS? But if you give away too much of your time, space or freedom, you stand to ruin a great friendship or romance if you’re not careful. If you’ve been dreaming about a move—to a warmer or cheaper clime or more culturally diverse locale—get familiar with real estate websites and listings. And to the degree you can, check out the area IRL, too. Happy where you are? Could Chez Crab use a little zhushing to make it all the sweeter?

{"title": "Gemini Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:05", "text": "(May 21 - June 20)\nReady for some levity, Gemini? Of course you are! And lightness and ease are scheduled to return this Tuesday, October 10, as penetrating Pluto, which has spent the past five (exhausting) months back-spinning through your eighth house of intense emotions, seduction and shared resources, finally corrects course. Some Geminis may come out of this relatively “unscathed” while others will be radically transformed. Whatever your situation, this is a good week to take a moment to assess the shifts and stress-test your foundation to ensure your structure is intact—then you can start to think about goals and what’s next. Honor the new depths through which you may have experienced life—meaning, don’t just dust yourself off and pick up where you left off before Pluto’s retrograde. Think of these hard-won lessons as your badges, and it can only be helpful to process what you’ve learned and all the ways you’ve grown over these possibly challenging five months. Whether you dealt with someone’s unsavory behavior or your own abandonment issues, consider it a major victory because it’s only when we courageously confront our personal demons that we can truly understand ourselves and our deepest desires.\nPluto’s power plays notwithstanding, the past six weeks may have felt like one endless party, and now you’re ready to bring order to the Gemini court. In a stroke of perfect timing, on Thursday, go-getter Mars blasts into Scorpio and your sixth house of work, service, organization and healthy living until November 24. This can bring the kind of laser-like focus and stick-with-it-ness your mercurial sign can struggle to find. Mars in its “second home” sign of Scorpio intensifies your drive and lends so much world-class perseverance that you’ll actually be motivated push yourself harder than you’re used to. Just don’t slip into Scorpio-style obsessiveness. “Extreme moderation” is plenty! At work, you’ll be unstoppable over these next six weeks. Set some ambitious (yet realistic) goals that will ensure you end the year strong. It’s not just about crossing the finish line: You want to get there first—AND with your integrity intact. Competitive Mars might tempt you to take a shortcut, but if your heart tells you that would be a hollow victory, resist the temptation!\nThis weekend is all about the sizzle. On Saturday, an annular “ring of fire” solar eclipse/new moon in fellow air sign Libra electrifies your passionate fifth house, amplifying your creative and romantic juices. Eclipses expose what’s been in the shadows, and this one could reveal a treasure trove of buried desires. This eclipse cycle—which started on April 20 and lasts until March 29, 2025—is galvanizing the Aries-Libra axis and its theme of independence and cooperation. And for you, Gem, as Saturday’s moonbeams start working their magic, you won’t be interested in compromising your standards or putting up with immature behavior from a halfhearted lover. Single? Be ready at a moment’s notice because Cupid could pay an unannounced visit within two weeks, and to gain the gifts of this eclipse, you’ll have to make a quick decision. Give a promising budding connection a chance to take root—you’ll never discover its highest potential if you don’t go all in. And since the fifth house rules fame, these next two weeks (peak manifesting time for this lunation) could bring some unanticipated recognition for your talents.

{"title": "Taurus Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:05", "text": "(April 20 - May 20)\nAs much as you love your routines and sense of security, Bull, sometimes a case of wanderlust is all it takes to send you racing off for new vistas. And that may be the case this Tuesday, October 10, as transformational Pluto ends its five-month retrograde through your ninth house of adventure and global expansion. Whether you literally felt your wings were clipped or this cycle has been one long “psychic hibernation,” the net result could very well have left you with cabin fever. The best way to overcome inertia and stuckness is by picking one or two new pursuits and lunging into them! It matters far less what they ARE than whether they’re juicy enough to get your imagination cranking and your body moving. The ninth house is about stretching out of your comfort zone and expanding your horizons, literally and figuratively. If you’ve got a vacay on the books or can pull one off quickly, that would be ideal. If not, simply researching a bucket-list trip—like a yoga or writing retreat or a voluntourism experience—can get your blood pumping. Closer to home, you can scratch that itch at the library, indie bookstores or any of your town’s myriad cultural options. Take the Plutonian lessons you learned (or are still downloading) from this dive into life’s shadow side and test the limits of your wingspan!\nRomance reboot: coming right up! On Thursday, passionate Mars blasts into Scorpio and your seventh house of relationships until November 24. For the next six weeks, your focus will be on the key connections in your life, both of a personal and professional nature. If you’re in an LTR, this is a great time to rekindle the sexy sparks or do something together that you’ve never done to get the blood pumping. If you’re single or in a “too soon to call it” situation, stop to ask yourself some big-picture questions, starting with, what kind of partner do you WANT? Mars is the action planet, and in this position, it can trigger necessary changes, but it still falls to YOU to enact them. With the lusty planet making tracks in this realm, you might find your thirst is spiking—bordering on insatiably—so take the steps to bring satisfaction. You may have to try some new approaches, but if the tried and true aren’t delivering results, it’s worth a shot.\nOne thing you can do on your own that’s good for your love life and your sense of adventure is improve your health and vitality. And perfect timing: On Saturday, an annular solar eclipse/new moon in Libra electrifies your sixth house of wellness (and work and service). Considering that autumn has just kicked off (in the Northern hemisphere), it’s not too late to start your own fall training, so join a new gym, buy a yoga package or find another way to commit to regular exercise. And since you are what you eat, do a proper inspection of what’s been going into your mouth lately. You may decide to cut out sugary snacks, gluten or alcohol, but be sure to replace those mood boosters with healthier things that also nourish you, including movement. This eclipse cycle—which is galvanizing the Aries-Libra axis—started on April 20 and lasts until March 29, 2025.

One is queued up to kick in any time starting this Tuesday, October 10, as potent transformer Pluto returns to forward motion in your career sector after a lethargic five-month retrograde. Slowdowns, setbacks and deep introspection may have been the major theme of your work life during that time. After five months in low gear, you’re ready to blast ahead. From now until next May, you’ll be drawing from a bottomless well of inspiration—and opportunities. As Pluto dances back and forth across the Capricorn-Aquarius border for the next 13 months, you’ve got a chance to go really big with your dreams, pitches and proposals. Reach out to the power players with your best material. And before Pluto moves into Aquarius and your eleventh house of colleagues and cohorts on January 20, take some time to envision your dream team of collaborators, mentors and coaches. Not only will you want to surround yourself with them, but you may need to lean on them a bit in your climb to the top.\nMore exciting shifts are in store this week, with a highlight coming on Thursday. That day—and stretching until November 24—your galactic guardian, impassioned Mars blasts into Scorpio and your erotic and intimate eighth house. This should bring the sizzle and seduction you’ve been craving. If you’re in a committed union, this can rekindle sparks and possibly inspire you to pool resources you’ve kept separate. But if you’re unattached or in a too-new-to-call-it situationship, take a minute to get clear about what you truly desire in a partner. Your wishes, coupled with a clear vision, will help you manifest what’s in your heart. Bear in mind that in Scorpio, the lusty red planet can turn up the heat AND stir up strong emotions as well as trust issues. What do you need to feel comfortable in a close relationship? And for some Aries, the million-dollar question: Do you even want commitment? The one thing Mars unequivocally demands is authenticity.\nThe feels are out in spades this Saturday as an annular “ring of fire” solar eclipse/new moon in Libra electrifies in your seventh house of partnerships. This could take a just-getting-off-the-ground connection and turn it into something mind-blowing—or it might open a tinderbox of intense emotions you’ve never experienced. If you’ve been keeping a secret crush to yourself, speak up! You might be pleasantly surprised to learn the attraction is mutual. Solar eclipses (new moons) signal beginnings, but sometimes they signal the beginning of the END of something that’s reached its expiration date. If you’ve been waiting for a sign that it’s time to move on, this eclipse could bring it. But take the next two weeks to really think it through so you don’t—whoops!—make a decision you’ll live to regret. This eclipse cycle is galvanizing the Aries-Libra axis from April 20 until March 29, 2025. If everything’s rock-solid, perhaps it’s time to put a literal rock on THAT finger…this could be one of the happy revelations this Libra solar eclipse brings.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

It's only spring, but the year 2023 has seen the end of several high-profile celebrity relationships, and there will likely be more to come. It's not a wish; it's just a fact.\nCheck below to see if any of your favorites have said goodbye to one another this year.\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's six-year romance was kept mostly private by the couple, although Alwyn inspired many of Swift's love songs over the years. News of their secret breakup, which took place in March and was initiated by Swift, broke on April 8. A source told People days later that although they had talked about marriage just months before, greater incompatibilities made it clear to the pair that they weren't right for the long, long term. “Joe has struggled with Taylor's level of fame and the attention from the public,” the source said. “The differences in their personalities have also become harder to ignore after years together. They've grown apart.”\n“Taylor didn't see them working out in the long run,” the source added.\nSoon after her break up with Alwyn, Taylor Swift was romantically connected to The 1975 frontman Matt Healy. The two had been linked for a brief time in 2014, but never confirmed anything. It seemed like they were very hot and heavy for a month or two, but sources said they split in June for good.\nElle Fanning, 24, and Max Minghella, 37, were first linked in July 2018 when they were seen holding hands in Florence, Italy, according to Us Weekly. The pair worked together on Teen Spirit, which Fanning starred in and Minghella wrote and directed that same year. The project is where their love story started. (Read more about their history here.)\nThroughout their run as a couple, both members opted to keep intimate details to themselves, although they would sometimes go to events together or post Instagrams showing moments from their life together.\nFanning announced the pair's breakup indirectly during her interview with Harper's Bazaar UK, published at the beginning of April. She revealed she was currently single but hopeful about finding love again. “I’m a hopeless romantic. I believe in love at first sight,” she said. “Call me crazy, but I believe in those things. I feel that it’s my destiny.”\nCaptain Marvel star Brie Larson and Elijah Allan-Blitz, a 36-year-old virtual reality director, were first photographed kissing in July 2019. The couple didn't talk about their relationship much while dating, but they did attend events together, such as the 2020 Oscars, The Daily Front Row's 2022 fashion awards in Los Angeles, and the D23 Expo in September 2022. The pair worked together on The Messy Truth VR Experience series, which earned them an Emmy in the ceremony's outstanding original interactive program category, per People.\nLarson and Allan-Blitz were last photographed together showing affection in September 2022, as seen above. \nLarson revealed that they privately broke up sometime after during a Harper's Bazaar interview published in late March 2023. She didn't specify when exactly the split occurred. She only said she's open to what's next in her life: “I don’t have a next job. I don’t have a home. I don’t have a partner. I don’t have a plan. I’m just completely open.”\nNoel Gallagher and Sara MacDonald met in the year 2000 while in Ibiza, and they got married in 2011. After 12 years of wedded life, they announced on January 16, 2023, that they were getting a divorce. \n“Noel and Sara will together continue to look after their children who remain their priority,” a spokesperson said. “Noel and Sara ask the media to respect their privacy and that of our family at this time.”\nThe former couple share two sons, Donovan, 15, and Sonny, 12. Gallagher has a daughter, Anaïs, 22, who he had in his former marriage to Meg Mathews, who he divorced in 2001.\nAfter five years together, Maisie Williams and Reuben Selby broke up. Williams shared the news with her followers on February 23, posting a selfie with Selby on her Instagram Stories. \nOver the pic, she wrote, “The end of an era. @reubenselby_ and I decided to end our relationship. Since we met 5 years ago, our connection always extended deeply into our shared, and separate, creative careers... and it will continue to do so.\"\nShe continued, “This decision is something we are so grateful or as we can protect the magic, that we can't help but emit, whenever we put our brains together. P.s no further questions, please, we must protect our children (my dog).”\nSelby reshared the announcement in his own Stories, adding a heart emoji.\nAvril Lavigne and Mod Sun started dating in January 2021, and became engaged in April 2022. But they ended their relationship, confirming their split on February 21.\n“Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months, but are no longer together as a couple,” an insider told People. \nMod Sun posted in early March that his life had “completely changed” on Instagram.\n“In 1 week my entire life completely changed,” he said in the caption. “I just know there’s a plan for it all. 💔 Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage.”\nAfter eight months together, singer Camila Cabello and Lox Club CEO Austin Kevitch split up after first being linked in summer of 2022. Entertainment Tonight reports that the news broke when a newsletter for Lox Club subscribers stated that, “Austin is single again.” \nIn news that shook the reality TV fandom, Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix broke it off in March 2023 after nine years together. The breakup was famously instigated by Sandoval's ongoing affair with Vanderpump Rules costar Raquel Leviss. \n“They had been having problems for a while, but this was the final straw for Ariana,” and insider told People. “She put up with a lot over the years, but she won't sit back and be disrespected this way.”\nMaddie Ziegler and Eddie Benjamin went public with their relationship in March 2020 after about a year together, but a source close to the couple told People that the Dance Moms alum and Australian singer broke up in February after three years.\nTheir last photos together posted on Zeigler's Instagram page were three months ago around the Christmas holidays.\n\nJust days shy of their 12th wedding anniversary, Witherspoon announced on her Instagram that she and her husband Jim Toth had decided to separate. She wrote in a statement from the former couple:\nIn late July, 2023, it was reported that Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro had split and broken off their engagement after two years together. The former couple recently released a three-song EP titled RR featuring the hit song “Beso.”  \n“Yes, a few months ago Rosi and I ended our engagement,” Alejandro wrote in his Instagram Stories July 26. “There are thousands of problems that could cause a breakup, but in our case it was not due to third parties or infidelity.”\nHe added, “During the space that I am taking to assimilate all of this, erroneous public allegations have emerged, and out of the respect I have for her, our families and all that we lived through, I could not stay silent and continue to watch how they try to destroy the story of the most real love that God has permitted me to live.” \n“I never saw myself in a position of even thinking that I would have to give public statements on this matter that is so private to me,” he concluded.\nA day later, Rosalía wrote a statement on her Instagram Stories.\n“I love, respect and admire Raúl very much,” she said. “Not paying attention to the theatrics, we know what we have experienced. This moment is not easy so thanks to everyone for understanding and respecting.”\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie, announced their separation after 18 years of marriage. The couple were married in 2005. They'd actually know one another in their childhoods, but reconnected again in 2003 at a charity gala. They share three children, 15-year-old Xavier, 14-year-old Ella-Grace and 9-year-old Hadrien. \n“As always, we remain a close family with deep love and respect for each other and for everything we have built and will continue to build,” they said in a statement on Instagram. \nAriana Grande and Dalton Gomez reportedly broke up in January, but it was noted in July when the Wicked star was seen at Wimbledon without her wedding ring. Soon after, it was confirmed that she is dating her co-star Ethan Slater.\nThey first broke up in November 2021 after dating for two years.  In July of 2023, it was confirmed that model Bella Hadid had broken up a few minutes earlier. In April of 2022, she shared some more about her relationship with Vogue, saying, “I think that’s why things have been able to last. When you give other people room to have opinions on things that are so personal to you, it poisons it.”\nCamila Cabello and Shawn Mendes broke up in November of 2021, but in April of 2023 they sparked dating rumors again when they were seen kissing at Coachella. However, a source told Entertainment Tonight in June, “Shawn and Camila broke up and are no longer seeing each other. They gave things a try, but ultimately the timing isn't right for either of them. They're both staying busy and doing their own things.” \nThe couple announced their divorce on July 17, 2023, after seven years of marriage and one of dating. Manganiello filed, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split.\n“They have been growing apart for some time now and tried to resolve things, but they are focused on different areas of their lives,” a source told People. “They definitely love and respect each other, but once that initial passion dies down and other areas get in the way, then little differences get bigger.”\nShortly after their 11th wedding anniversary, Portman and Millepied reportedly separated after news of the choreographer's affair, with 25-year-old climate activist Camille Étienne, broke. They have supposedly been working on rebuilding trust because the actress wants to preserve a home for their two children.\n“Natalie believes Benjamin’s affair was a brief and stupid liaison that means nothing to him,” a source told US Weekly in August 2023.\nAfter 14 months of marriage and seven years together, Spears and Asghari separated at the end of July 2023. The marriage has “been on the rocks for months” according to a source. \nThough they have yet to comment on their alleged split, TMZ reported that Jonas and Turner's relationship has been “circling the drain” for the past six months over Labor Day weekend.

{"title": "All About Dalton Gomez, Ariana Grande’s Ex-Husband and Partner of 3.5+ Years", "date": "2023-10-08 19:26:00", "text": "The former couple officially filed for divorce on September 18, 2o23.\nOn May 15, 2021, Ariana Grande secretly made one of the biggest moves of her life: She married her fiancé and partner of over a year, Los Angeles real estate agent Dalton Gomez. The pair got engaged just ahead of the Christmas holiday, less than a year after the two were first seen together in February. On May 26, Grande shared the first photos from their wedding, taken by Stefan Kohli. The shots gave the public a rare and intimate look at the two together. \nGomez and Grande had publicly been together for over a year and privately longer. But they always kept their relationship out of the limelight, from the very beginning. \nTMZ reported in late March 2020 that the man Ariana Grande was seen making out with around Valentine’s Day was actually Gomez, and he had been her new boyfriend for “several months,” according to the outlet’s Grande sources. People and E! independently reported the same news hours later: that Grande is off the market but has been keeping her new relationship private.\nGrande and Gomez quarantined together, and he appeared on her Instagram Story, TMZ pointed out.\nThe singer confirmed their relationship in her “Stuck With U” music video on May 8, 2020. On May 26, 2020, Grande gave Gomez his first proper Instagram shoutout.\nGomez made his Instagram private right as news broke of their dating, but Grande did follow him. Amid news in July 2023 of their separation, Gomez's Instagram appears to have been disabled or deleted. Gomez and Grande ultimately filed for divorce in September 2023.\nSo who is Gomez? Here, all you need to know about him and his relationship with Grande, including info about their private wedding and what led the couple to privately separate in January 2023.\nAccording to his bio on the site, Gomez was raised in southern California and has been working in the luxury real estate market for five years. He works with A-list buyers and has sold multi-million dollar homes.\nTMZ points out he has other celebrity friends. He shared an Instagram Story of himself hanging out with Miley Cyrus in July 2017.\nDalton Gomez via Instagram Stories pic.twitter.com/wm5j3WUOKV\nA little over a year after Grande and Gomez made their first public appearance together, the two have wed, TMZ and E! report. A rep for Grande confirmed the wedding on May 17, detailing that the two wed in a private ceremony in her Montecito home over the weekend.\nAs for why the venue was chosen, a source told People, “Both Ari and Dalton love Montecito. They spend a lot of time there. It seems only natural that they would get married at Ari's beautiful and historic house.”\nAn insider describes the gathering to E! as “tiny and intimate. There was a lot of love and everyone is really happy.” TMZ was told by sources that there were less than 20 guests, and the nuptials were informal. There was no real “ceremony,” per the outlet, just a casual vow exchange. Neither Grande nor Gomez have posted about the news immediately after it broke.\nE! was told that “hundreds of white florals” were used as decor. “It was beautiful but not over the top,” a source said. “Ari wanted it to be simplistic and tasteful. All they cared about was having family there and to be able to enjoy the special moment together.” \nOn May 26, Grande shared photos from their wedding, taken by Stefan Kohli, in three Instagram posts. She confirmed their wedding date was May 15. She wore a Vera Wang dress for her nuptials. \nGrande broke the news of their engagement on December 20, sharing rare photos of them together and showing off the diamond and pearl ring that Gomez gave her. “forever n then some,” Grande wrote. The engagement comes 10 months after the couple were first seen in public together in February 2020.\nPeople reported that Gomez gave Grande a platinum, diamond wedding band he helped design. Solow & Co designed the band, and a spokesperson for Solow & Co told People that “they worked with Dalton on this. It's a beautiful, tasteful platinum and diamond pave band. Dalton was very happy with it.”\nGrande didn't keep the couple's honeymoon destination a complete secret. On July 11, she shared a gallery of honeymoon photos featuring her and Gomez in Amsterdam.\nGrande and Gomez kissed in a photo she shared of them on her Instagram two days after Valentine's Day. Grande wore a lace black dress alongside her suited up husband.\nGrande shared a series of photos of her and her friends, including her husband Gomez. “home is wherever these humans (and dogs) happen to be :),” she wrote. Gomez appears in the second slide:\nOn November 29, 2022, Grande shared a gallery of images including rare snaps of her husband. It was captionless, but within its first five hours up, had already garnered 3.4 million likes.\nFor Valentine's Day 2023, Grande gave another rare look at her and Gomez's relationship in a tribute to him.\nGrande, who had kept a relatively low profile on social media while shooting Wicked, posted two Instagram Stories to celebrate her husband on Valentine's Day 2023. She reposted his tribute to her from his private Instagram (“my forever Valentine,” he wrote) and added her own post of just him, tagging him.\n\nGrande and Gomez have kept most details about their relationship out of the press. But after their May 2021 wedding, sources spoke to Entertainment Tonight and People about what the two's relationship is like.\n“Ariana's brother Frankie and her mom are so happy for her. They think Dalton really balances Ariana out and allows her to be her true self,” Entertainment Tonight's source said. “Ariana appreciates that Dalton accepts her and loves her for who she is. He's a little nerdy and hardworking and she loves that about him. He's also very protective over her and goes above and beyond to make her happy.”\nTwo sources spoke to People after the wedding.\nA friend told the outlet that “they're a great fit together. Dalton's entirely unfazed by the scope of her celebrity and is very grounding for her. He's young but mature and knows what he wants out of life.”\nA second source said that “he is very hardworking and focused. He is low-key and doesn't like attention. He isn't impressed by celebrities. He is perfect for her. Their life together is pretty special.”\nGomez appeared on Grande’s social media, hanging on her couch and petting her dog. TMZ’s sources told the outlet that the two were “seeing each other for several months now.”\nPeople’s source confirmed that Grande “has been with the same group of people for days” on March 25. “One of the people she is with right now is Dalton—they have been hanging out for a couple of months. Ariana doesn’t want to do another public relationship so she is trying to keep this one quiet, but she seems very happy with Dalton.”\nAnother source updated Entertainment Tonight on the couple’s quarantine at the end of May 2020. The insider said Grande is “in a really good place” but is in no rush to share her private life with him on social media.  “Ariana has had some hesitation being so public about her relationship with Dalton as she’s seen how that has worn on her past relationships [like with Pete Davidson and Mac Miller],” the source told ET, adding, “Dalton and Ariana are in Los Angeles together during quarantine, and it has been a great opportunity for them to spend quality time together.”\nWhile Grande hasn’t shared extensive details about her relationship on social media, she offered a little glimpse of it during her and Gomez’s birthdays. In late June, Grande went ’gram official with Gomez in honor of her 27th birthday. She posted a series of photos, one of which was a cuddled-up selfie of the couple. “almost 27 :)” she captioned the post.\nAfter celebrating her 27th birthday with a Midsommar-themed birthday affair, Grande shared a few more snaps of herself and Gomez kissing. \nFor Gomez’s 25th birthday in 2020, Grande gave the biggest glimpse into their relationship yet on Instagram. She shared several photos and videos of the pair, writing, “hbd to my baby my best friend my fav part of all the days :) i love u.” He wasn’t tagged in the post, but she also hasn’t disabled the comments—a difference from her last post featuring Gomez. \nFor Gomez’s 26th birthday in 2021, Grande posted a tribute with what looks like a photo from their Amsterdam honeymoon:\n“happy birthday to my baby my husband my best friend,” she wrote on her Instagram Story post. “i love you infinitely.”\nShe also shared this black-and-white image from their wedding:\nGrande confirmed her and Gomez’s relationship during the final minute of “Stuck With U.” The two appear dancing and showing PDA together. This is Grande’s first public acknowledgement of their relationship.\nGrande featured a clear shot and footage of Gomez on her Instagram Story on May 26. Gomez had helped her with her and Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Weather Girls short. She captioned a shot of him creating “rain” for the video with emojis. It was one of the first unobscured shots she’s shared of him. Gomez was hooded in her “Stuck With U” music video, which was the first glimpse she gave the public of their relationship.\nIn February, footage came out of Grande making out with Gomez at Bar Louie in Northridge, California. She arrived with him and her friends at 1 a.m. and stayed for about 30 minutes. Grande just had water there, TMZ reported at the time, while her friends drank. The guy she kissed “wasn’t instantly recognizable.” \nwait i hope the rumors about ariana dating dalton gomez are true.....i mean look at him🥺 pic.twitter.com/5xvcZPHpiN\nSince she seems to be ready to reveal this, here is part of my old thread: Ariana is dating Dalton Gomez, a real estate agent. pic.twitter.com/x8VXiifhMF\nFinally, last night Ariana posted several stories on instagram where Dalton is clearly seen. In the one he pets Toulouse, you can get a glimpse of an offering bowl he has, as posted by his brother Dakota. pic.twitter.com/DHdqupUyyA\nGrande was last linked romantically to Social House’s Mikey Foster. But multiple sources confirmed to ELLE in September that actually, Grande had been single. Grande and Gomez’s relationship is her first remotely public one since her engagement to Pete Davidson ended in October 2018.\nNo outlet has reported specifically on how the two met, but E! was told by a source at the end of March that the two share a lot of friends. “[They] run in the same circle,” the source said. “He used to be a dancer, and they have many mutual friends. She’s gotten to know him quickly with the quarantine. They’ve been spending a lot of one on one time at home.” \nGrande hasn’t posted on social media about Gomez. She explained why days after news broke that they’re dating. Grande wrote on a since-deleted Instagram Story that the internet’s criticism of her personal life led her to choose to share less of it on social media.\nGrande shared the video Florence Pugh posted defending her boyfriend Zach Braff after he was bullied by fans on Pugh’s IG because of his 21-year age gap with Pugh . “I am 24 years old,” Pugh told those fans in her video. “I do not need you to tell me who I should and should not love. And I would never in my life ever, ever tell anyone who they can and cannot love. It is not your place. And really, it has nothing to do with you. So if those rules are something that you do not like, then please unfollow me because the abuse that you throw at him is abuse that you’re throwing at me.”\nGrande praised Pugh for her statement and wrote that it resonated deeply with her because of her own experience sharing her life online. “Sharing special, personal life things that make u happy on the internet can be truly traumatic,” Grande said. “I know I’ve taken a step back from doing so to protect my loved ones and myself but I just wanted to share this and let u know how perfectly u expressed this and how appreciated u are for doing so @florencepugh.” \nSleuth fans noticed Grande follows both Gomez and his tattoo artist brother Dakota. One pointed out that Gomez and Aaron Kirman had the listing for the property she purchased. He also commented “This gurl cute” on her Instagram Live in March, the fan pointed out, to which Grande responded “I feel blessed.”\nNow to the more solid proof. Ariana has gone live on instagram yesterday, and one particular comment made her say “I feel blessed.” This comment is by Dalton, and her response is in a little delay, like responses usually are in a live stream on instagram. pic.twitter.com/WG08R9xokq\nA source confirmed this account to Us Weekly. “Ariana was looking for a home outside of Los Angeles to be her getaway house, and her team found Dalton to help,” the insider explained. “When she saw him, she immediately thought he was cute and very good-looking, and she asked her team to set up an in-person meeting with him. Ariana fell very hard for Dalton shortly after they met.” \nThe fact that Grande and Gomez are keeping their dating low-key isn’t the only difference between him and her exes. A source told Us Weekly in late August that Gomez really takes care of her. Grande’s previous boyfriends never “met her needs in the same way Dalton does. Her exes acted as though she was demanding and had crazy standards,” the source said.\nThat source added that Gomez “is the type of guy she has been looking for. He’s very protective of her, will go out of his way for her and does little things that are chivalrous. Dalton will go above and beyond to meet her needs.”\nGiven that things have really escalated. Us’s source said that “their relationship is serious. They’ve fallen madly in love with each other.”\nA few days after this update on their relationship, Gomez attended the MTV VMAs by Grande’s side. She posted a photo of the pair holding hands on Instagram, sneakily placing it as the last pic in the post. Us’s update came just three months before the two announced their engagement.\nEntertainment Tonight got an update from a source about how Grande and Gomez were settling into life as newlyweds—and how marriage changed how they feel about sharing their relationship publicly.\n“Ariana and Dalton felt like before they were married they couldn't be as open about their relationship without it being scrutinized in the media and now they feel way more at ease,” the outlet's source said. “They have plans to travel more together and feel closer than ever.”\nGrande and Gomez enjoy their new life as a married couple, the source added: “Ariana is happy and feels very relaxed. She feels like she is entering a new chapter of life and is excited to see where it goes.”\nThe couple really likes “making unified decisions,” the source said. “Ariana is Dalton's first priority in everything that they do and he really values her and shows it. Ariana loves that Dalton is super chill and how understanding he is of her.” \nDays after Entertainment Tonight reported that Grande and Gomez were more comfortable sharing their relationship publicly, Grande did just that on her birthday. The singer posted a video of the two kissing on her Instagram Story. She captioned it, “a bday baby. deeply thankful for so much love.”\nAriana Grande Via Instagram Stories pic.twitter.com/NxZ24yr6JO\nOctober 30 marked a new era in Grande’s music, and several songs on her sixth studio album seem to be about Gomez. In her first song, “Positions,” Grande sings about wanting to “meet your mama on a Sunday” and “make a lotta love on Monday” in reference to her current relationship.\nOther “Positions” lyrics nod to her new romance, including “Perfect, perfect / You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)” and “Heaven sent you to me / I'm just hopin’ I don’t repeat history” as she did with ex-fiancé Pete Davidson. However, Grande doesn’t name Gomez outright as she did with her past loves in the track, “thank u, next.”\nThere are other nods to Gomez throughout the record. The explicit “34+35” lyrics paint a picture of the couple’s sex life. It also talks about her desire to have a family with Gomez. “You might think I’m crazy / The way I’ve been cravin’ / If I put it quite plainly / Just give me them babies,” she sings, later belting, “who’s counting the time when we got it for life?”\n“Safety Net” is about Grande falling for Gomez after being hurt by past relationships. In that track, she sings, “You’re making me forget my past / Never thought I’d feel like that / I came to peace with my past / Now you got me off track.” \nThe song “POV” also cements just how serious Grande and Gomez are. “I wanna love me / The way that you love me,” she sings. “For all of my pretty / And all of my ugly too / I’d love to see me from your point of view.”\nOn Christmas Day 2020, Grande posted a photo of her and Gomez cuddling near the Christmas tree as the first photo in a holiday gallery.“\"merry :)” she wrote. \nShe also included photos of her and Gomez spending the day with her brother Frankie, Frankie’s boyfriend, and her mom Joan. \nIn a sign things between Grande and Gomez are still going strong a year into dating, the private couple made a rare appearance in Los Angeles. On March 6, Grande and Gomez enjoyed a romantic dinner at the FIA restaurant in Santa Monica. Paparazzi photographed the two lovebirds wearing matching masks as they left the restaurant. Grande also wore her massive one-of-kind engagement ring, of course. The date was one of the first public sightings of Grande and Gomez together since Gomez proposed.\nIn a rare public show of affection, Grande posted a few photos of her and Gomez getting cozy.\nLove a just-because romantic moment. \nGrande and Gomez leaned into their first Halloween as a married couple with two different looks. They did an elaborate Miss Creature From the Black Lagoon look, with Grande as the swamp monster and Gomez as a handsome scuba man. They then debuted a more causal (for celeb standards) second couple costume: Audrey and Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors. A PDA shot capped off the gallery of that second look:\nGrande had family and contestants from Season 21 of The Voice over for Thanksgiving, and shared a series of photos and videos from the night of celebration.\nAmongst them was a cute picture of Grande sitting next to Gomez and hugging their dog Toulouse, hiding her face so only her signature ponytail and ribbon were visible.\nAriana Grande has been incredibly busy with the filming schedule for Wicked, in which she plays Glinda. A source told ET that Gomez has been backing her up during this demanding time.\n“Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez have both been keeping busy with work projects,” the source claimed. “Ariana has been so focused, but Dalton has been there with her and supporting her behind the scenes... He is happy for her and they are very in love.”\nA second source added, “This role is Ariana's dream and she's throwing herself fully into it and Dalton is supportive.”\nGrande revealed just how long she and Gomez had been dating in May 2023 when she posted a photo of them kissing on their wedding day to mark their two-year anniversary. “2 [years married], 3.5 years together!!!! I love him so,” she wrote. It served as a remarkably rare look into their relationship:\nOn Sunday, July 15, Grande was seen at Wimbledon without Gomez, watching the men's singles final between Djokovic and Alcaraz. Fans noticed that there was no ring on her wedding ring finger, despite it being a high profile event. She had been seen on social media without it as well, so this added fuel to rumors that they might be going through a rough patch.\nGrande was seated between Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield and Bridgerton star Jonathan Bailey. \nGrande has been in the UK filming Wicked Part 1 for some time now, and Gomez has deleted his Instagram. \nGrande’s lawyer Laura Wasser was the first to file for divorce on Monday, September 18, citing “irreconcilable differences” as their reason for splitting. Gomez filed after. Their date of separation was listed as February 20, 2023.\nSources explained to TMZ that Grande and Gomez worked everything out before they filed. Grande will “cut Dalton a check, and that will be that,” the outlet wrote.\nA source revealed to TMZ that there are no hard feelings between them, and their delay in filing was just because the former couple was sorting out everything and settling in private.\nGrande sparked speculation that she and Gomez may have broken up when she attended Wimbledon on July 16, 2o23, not wearing her wedding band. A day later, TMZ confirmed that Grande and Gomez had privately separated in January, per multiple sources connected to the couple. Their issues predated Grande going abroad to the U.K. to shoot Wicked in December. The outlet reported that privately, Grande and Gomez tried to reconcile a few months ago, but the effort failed.\nGrande and Gomez are still on good terms though, with the outlet describing them “friends [who] still talk on the phone regularly.” Their romance has ended though, and one source characterized them as “heading for divorce.”\nGrande did not immediately comment on the report.\nIn the first day after TMZ broke the news of Grande and Gomez's split, more outlets received details on the private effort they made the reconcile. TMZ reported that Gomez and Grande lived separate lives starting in January; they tried reconciling briefly in May but after two weeks, called it. Entertainment Tonight received more intel from a source on that last-ditch effort. “Dalton went to Europe recently to be with Ariana and try to work things out between them,” the source said. “But it just wasn’t working. They were having issues for a while, but they are trying to be as respectful as they can and protect each other's privacy through this breakup.”\nSources told TMZ that Gomez has already begun dating again with Grande's blessing since they separated. The outlet reported that Gomez struggled with Grande's fame once COVID-19 restrictions lifted.\nA source also noted to People that distance was a factor as Gomez's work keeps him in Los Angeles. “She was happy in Los Angeles for a couple of years. She wanted to make a life there with Dalton,” the source started.\n“He is super focused on his career and needs to live in Los Angeles,” the source continued. “It's definitely been an issue for them. Dalton's career is demanding and he can't leave Los Angeles often. So when [Grande] started filming Wicked in England, they were in for a long-distance marriage.”\nOn August 25, Gomez was photographed out in public for the first time since his breakup from Grande was announced. He appeared downcast in photos and was no longer wearing his wedding ring. A source spoke to Us Weekly on August 28 and confirmed that Gomez was still having trouble with the split.\n“It’s been a little while since Ariana and Dalton split, but he’s been adjusting to his new normal and learning to accept it for what it is,” the source said. “It’s certainly not how he expected things to play out because he obviously assumed they would be together forever.”\n“He never imagined he would be going through a divorce in the public eye,” the source added. “But he’s hanging in there and is grateful for his friends and family who have been really supportive.”\nOn September 13, a source told Entertainment Tonight that Gomez is still healing from the end of his and Grande’s marriage. “[He’s] throwing himself into work and working harder than ever since his split from Ariana,” the source said. “He is trying to stay distracted and keep himself busy in positive ways.”\nAs for his love life, Gomez “is dating a little bit and a lot of girls are giving Dalton attention. He is not completely over his relationship with Ariana, but he is doing his best to move forward.”\nThe update came a day after a source claimed to Daily Mail that Grande hadn’t completely let Gomez go. “It seems as if Ariana is holding onto Dalton in case things with Ethan don’t work. It is just so strange that she is living with Ethan and has not filed documents to end it with Dalton,” the source alleged. Of course, neither Grande, Gomez, nor Slater have commented on any of this.\nJust a few weeks after filing for divorce, the former couple came to an agreement on the end of their marriage. TMZ reports they had a prenup and there will be no spousal support. However, Gomez is reportedly receiving $1,250,000, tax-free, and half of the net proceeds from the sale of their home in Los Angeles. Grande will be asked to pay up to $25,000 of her ex-husband's attorney fees and for his continued 24-hour security. \nA source told Page Six, “Ariana and Dalton really wanted to take care of each through all of this and make it as easy on one another as possible—which is why they really took their time with everything.”\nThe insider added, “They have a strong mutual respect for eachother.” \nAnother source told TMZ, “There is still a strong mutual love and respect between Ariana and Dalton and they wanted to make sure everything was done right in lockstep with one another.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nIt’s a love story that could actually be a Hollywood rom-com: The top American pop singer and the top American football player meet up, sparks fly, and they end up dating with the world watching. Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have dominated headlines since their romance was first rumored to be a thing, with Swift’s first appearance at Kelce’s game in Kansas City becoming one of the year’s most buzzed-about moments. \nWhile the two may not be official just yet, things are escalating quickly, and anything is possible in the future, sources have made clear.\nHere, the full history of their relationship that is known so far.\nKelce plays “Kiss, Marry, Kill” in an interview, with the choices being Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. “Damn, that’s messed up. I don’t want to kill any of them,” he prefaced. He then answered, “Ariana is kill, unfortunately. I love you, but you’re gone. And then Taylor Swift would be the kiss, and then Katy Perry would be the—what’s the last one? Katy Perry would be the marry.” The interview resurfaced in 2023 as the dating rumors with Swift began to gain traction.\nKelce discusses shooting his shot and missing while attending Swift’s Eras Tour show in Kansas City, Missouri on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason, an NFL player for the Philadelphia Eagles. Kelce’s remarks get media pickup.\n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce said. “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are a friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it. All right now.”\nJason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or phone number. \n“You know which one,” Kelce answered. “She doesn’t meet anybody and at least she didn’t want to meet me so I, um, I took that personal. But it was an unbelievable show and I’ve only seen Arrowhead filled like that for Chiefs games with that much excitement, and yeah, everybody was dressed in pink and purple going crazy. It was a wild show.”\nSwift and Kelce’s romance takes off this month. Here’s the play-by-play (pun very much intended).\nSwift goes out in New York City, wearing Foundrae’s Forever & Always a Pair Pendant, which has an opal teardrop stone on it. Fans note later that opal is Kelce’s birth stone (he is a Libra), and the necklace may have been an easter egg.\nThe Messenger reports that Swift and Kelce have been spending time together. “Taylor and Travis have been quietly hanging out,” a source told the outlet. “She saw him when she was in NYC a few weeks ago.”\nThat same day, another source told Entertainment Tonight that Kelce isn’t Swift’s secret new boyfriend: They are “not officially dating.” Sources will continue to stress this in the coming weeks.\nKelce’s brother Jason adds fuel to dating rumors during his appearance on the TNF Nightcap’s post-game interview.\n“I’ve seen these rumors…I cannot comment,” he said, noting that “ever since Catching Kelce [Kelce’s 2016 E! dating series], everyone’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life, so, I don’t really know what’s going on there. I know Trav is having fun, we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.”\nTony asked Jason about the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift dating rumors 😂@TonyGonzalez88 | #TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/iHHqDvWC9B\nThat same day, Kelce dodges questions about Swift during an interview with Andrew Siciliano. \n“I’m not gonna talk about my personal life,” Kelce said. “I know what you writers wanna hear, and you wanna hear more about that, and I’m not gonna give you anything.”\nJason jokingly confirms the Taylor-Travis dating rumors on Audacy’s SportsRadio 94 WIP. When asked about the gossip surrounding his brother and Swift, Jason said that “it’s hard to answer because I don’t really know a lot about Travis’ love life. I try to keep his business kind of his business, stay out of that world. But having said that, I think he’s doing great, and I think it’s all 100 percent true, and I hope this thing goes a mile.” Then he made it clear he was just kidding: “No, I’m joking, I don’t know what's happening.”\nThe Messenger also gets more intel on the relationship from Swift’s side that day.\n“She and Travis have hung out twice, and it’s nothing serious,” the source said. “She thinks he is very charming, and they have been texting this last week. He is a little embarrassed at how much attention they are getting, but he has told her he would love to continue seeing her.”\n“They are seeing where things go,” the source added, noting that Swift’s “friends are always playfully suggesting people to set her up with. [She’s] in her fun girl era and strictly having fun right now.”\nKelce says he invited Swift to his game during an interview with The Pat McAfee Show. She later does attend it.\n “It’s hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it’s like a game of telephone,” Kelce said of the dating rumors. “No one actually knows what’s going on, especially when you got [my brother] Jason Kelce on live television telling people both sides—he doesn’t know, it’s true, this and that.” \nRegarding his status with Swift, Travis gave a frank answer: “I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court. I told her, you know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit. So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”\nA source close to the situation tells E! that Swift and Kelce have no plans to see each other imminently, downplaying their closeness. \n“[They] met up once in New York,” the source said. “They’ve been texting and talking here and there but [have] no set plans to see each other again. It’s been very low-key as he’s been in season.” Obviously, that changes two days later.\nSwift takes up Kelce’s invitation and attends his game in Kansas City. She is photographed in the stands with his mom. Sources reveal later that it was her first time meeting his family, and it went well.\nSwift and Kelce are filmed leaving the game, marking the first video of them together.\nDaily Mail later reveals that Swift met Kelce’s friends and family at his home before going to the game. The outlet wrote that she spent an hour with them before boarding a party bus with them to the stadium. \nA source told Daily Mail, “Travis wasn’t at his house, but it was filled with his friends and family. He has a personal chef and several friends from high school and college who use his place as a crash pad whenever they are in town.”\nA source told People that day that, once again, Swift and Travis aren’t serious, but she was happy to see him play. \n“Taylor is very focused on work right now and hanging out with her girlfriends. Travis invited her to the game, and of course she said ‘yes,’” the source said. “She just thought it was a fantastic way to spend Sunday.”\nA source later added to People that “they’re having fun. This was Taylor’s first time meeting his mom and dad, and everyone was enjoying themselves. She was super chill and low-key hanging out with his friends and family.”\nKelce and Swift end their day celebrating with his teammates and family at Prime Social Rooftop. They get affectionate there.\nOutlets get more information on the post-game date. \nInitial reports claim that Swift and Kelce paid to rent out Prime Social Rooftop. In reality, they had a reservation.\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight, “Travis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis. The two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis’ teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 A.M.”\nTMZ was also told that Swift and Kelce were affectionate at the game’s after-party. “Sources say they were holding hands at the restaurant he rented out for his family, friends, and teammates after the game. At one point Taylor was sitting on Travis’ lap,” TMZ wrote.\nIn addition, multiple sources discuss Swift and Kelce’s current relationship status.\nTMZ was told by sources that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is not a publicity stunt, first of all. The sources shared that Swift and Kelce have seen each other “several times” over the last few months, but are not officially dating yet. Previous in-person meetings have been in a “very private setting,” per the sources.\nEntertainment Tonight’s insiders said that things between Swift and Kelce remain casual, but he has potential to be a good match for her. Swift specifically liked that he pursued her.\n“Travis has never shied away from his desire to give dating with Taylor a try, which he even said during a press conference a few months ago after seeing Swift in concert,” one source said. “Travis and Taylor are taking things slowly and not rushing into anything serious. Both are very career-focused, so the focus is on that for now, but that’s not going to stop them from enjoying life when it’s the right moment.”\nA second source added that “Travis and Taylor have a lot in common and they are having a great time getting to know each other. They have similar values. She likes that he pursued her and it has been easy and exciting for both of them.”\n“Taylor is enjoying some time off from touring and it’s been fun hanging out with Travis during this break,” the source continued. “Taylor wants a guy that’s into his career, does his own thing, but is also supportive and understands her, and Travis fits those qualities.” \nLast of all, a source told People that Swift and Kelce’s romance is in the “super, super early days.” That source added of their future, “They’re just hanging out, and there’s no pressure.”\nSwift is seen arriving at the airport in Kansas City around 10:30 A.M. to fly back home. Daily Mail reported that security vehicles were seen parked on Kelce’s street on Sunday and Monday nights in a clear sign that the two stars spent some private time together post-game.\nMultiple sources speak to Us Weekly that day about Swift and Kelce’s relationship. Once again, they say it’s not serious.\nOne Us Weekly source said that Swift met Kelce through a mutual friend: “They have been on a few dates, and Taylor is smitten with him. It is not serious, and Taylor is having fun right now.”\n“[She’s] working hard right now and not looking for anything serious,” the source continued, citing her tour schedule and his NFL schedule as reasons why a more committed romance would be more difficult. “But anything is possible. They’re getting closer and closer every day.”\nKelce speaks on his podcast New Heights for the first and maybe last time about his relationship with Swift.\n“I know I brought all this attention to me, right?” Kelce started. “I did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everyone how butt-hurt I was that I didn’t get to meet Taylor.”\nAt the same time, he has no any regrets. “You miss 100 percent of [the shots] you don’t take, baby, so yeah,” he said, then adding, “What’s real is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives. She’s not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like the McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\n“I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports…will kind of have to be where I keep it,” he said.\n“I’m on the roller coaster, the roller coaster of life,” Kelce added of the experience dating Swift. “Yeah, I notice a few things [are different], like paparazzi outside my house.”\nKelce gave Swift two shout-outs on the program: “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up [to the Chiefs game],” he said first. “That was pretty ballsy, that was pretty ballsy, yeah. I just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things about her, you know the friends and family. She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light, and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive.”\nOf the game generally, he said, “It was definitely a game I’ll remember. That’s for damn sure. And then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end.”\nHis second shout-out to Swift was simple: “Shout-out to Taylor for coming through and seeing me rock the stage.” \nLater that day, TMZ runs the first photo of Swift and Kelce showing PDA from the post-game party.\nAfter rumors emerge that Swift could be attending Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, a source confirms it to Entertainment Tonight. “Taylor Swift is planning on attending the Jets game this Sunday,” the source said.\nA second source added, “The Jets haven’t been notified specifically about Taylor coming to Sunday’s game, but are prepared to welcome her if she decides to come. Patrick Mahomes booked a suite for his family and friends and Taylor could be joining that suite.”\nIn a separate report, a different source told Entertainment Tonight that Swift wasn’t initially expecting much from her and Kelce’s time together, but things are changing. “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime,” the source said. “So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.” \nThe Daily Mail reports that the couple has allegedly discussed doing a Halloween costume together and potentially attending Heidi Klum’s famous Halloween party, a celeb-packed event. The “insider” said they joked about dressing as Barbie and Ken. \nThat source gave more detail on their dynamic, claiming that “the whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is okay with. He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”\nAs rumored, Swift attends Kelce’s Sunday night game against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. She brings a pack of celeb friends including Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sophie Turner, Hugh Jackman, and Sabrina Carpenter.\nSwift and Kelce aren’t photographed or filmed together during the game, truly keeping things more private. They left the stadium separately after the game. Page Six reported that Kelce was photographed leaving Swift’s apartment earlier in the day, although not because he spent the night Saturday. \nA source told Page Six that the two had a Sunday morning hangout, as Kelce adhered to his team’s 11 P.M. curfew on Saturday. He left Swift’s apartment around 11 A.M.\nAfter the game, Swift went to Zero Bond with her brother Austin Swift and his girlfriend Sydney Ness. Kelce was not photographed there with her.\nMultiple sources tell People that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is undefined.\n“[They’re] still just getting to know each other,” the first source said. “It’s nothing too serious.”\nA second source added that their relationship is casual and unlabeled: “He is a charming guy. It’s more of a hanging out situation than dating,” that source said. They added that while Kelce is spending time with Swift, “he’s focusing on football like he always has. During the NFL season, his priority is the Chiefs, and it’s all about the team.”\nSources speak to Us Weekly about Swift’s feelings for Kelce and how her approach to their romance is differing from hers with ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. \n“Taylor has decided she’s not going to hide anymore,” one source said. “She’s going to be her authentic self and enjoy life.”\nKelce and Swift “talk every day,” the source added. “Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis. They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”\nA second source said Kelce feels similarly: “Travis is completely smitten.”\nA third source said, “Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back. If something feels right—like it does with Travis—she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”\nKelce, meanwhile, discusses how he wasn’t expecting his relationship with Swift to blow up the way it did during his appearance on Chasin’ It with Trey Wingo and Chase Daniel. “I had no idea, man,” he said. “I had no idea. You can’t tell me that anybody else did either, but I can’t be mad at how it’s all played out. I’ll say that.”\nSwift is seen leaving New York City the day before Kelce’s birthday, sparking rumors she may be traveling to spend the day with him. \nKelce, meanwhile, spoke about the attention his romance with Swift has gotten from the NFL during his New Heights podcast. “They’re overdoing it a little bit, for sure,” he said of their promotion. “Especially my situation [with Swift]. I think they’re just trying to have fun with it.”\nAfter Kelce’s remarks go viral, the NFL defends their social media approach. “We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what’s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,” the organization tells People. “The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we’ve leaned into in real time, as it’s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.”\nOn Friday, October 6, Kelce was interviewed at the team's practice facility, and shared a bit about the media frenzy around his connection to Swift.\n“As all the attention comes it feels like, you know, I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl and right now even more on top of the world,” he told reporters. “It's fun.”\n“We're learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place, but at the same time it comes with it,” Kelce continued. “You got a lot of people that care about Taylor and for good reason.”\nVideo of everything Travis Kelce said today about Taylor Swift, Pfizer backlash, his b-day and focusing on football:\"I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl, and now even more so.\"\"You've got a lot of people that care about Taylor, for good reason.\" #ChiefsKingdom @KCTV5 pic.twitter.com/qIRzyAleAd\nHe added, “Just gotta keep living and learning and enjoying the moments. At the end of the day, I've always been pretty good about compartmentalizing and being able to stay focused in this building. So I'll just keep rolling with that.”\nWhen asked if it was a distraction, Kelce focused on his teammates.\n“Everybody's having fun with it, you know? Whether I think they're overdoing it or not, I know I brought this to myself,” Kelce said. “I've been fortunate enough to have with it. That's all that matters, that it's not pissing anybody off, over here at least.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick's Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-08 18:29:00", "text": "Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick have one of the longest marriages in Hollywood, but they have managed to keep much of their private life private outside of a few strategic announcements. This is especially surprising considering how huge Parker got as the iconic Carrie Bradshaw on HBO's Sex and the City.\nThe couple seem to really understand one another, and that likely comes from the fact they understand their shared industry very well, too. They started dating in the early nineties, married in the late nineties, and went on to have three children together. \nHere's a timeline of the couple's 30-plus year relationship.\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick met after being introduced to Parker by her brothers, Pippin and Toby, who founded the Naked Angels Theater Company. Both Parker and Broderick were already in the business, and the actor directed a play at the siblings' theater. They were then introduced.   \nAfter five years of dating, the couple finally performed together side-by-side. Their debut was on Broadway in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Parker told the Los Angeles Times, “He's probably the funniest fellow I've met in my whole life...He's so bright, so handsome, I think he's the most handsome man I've seen in my life. And he inspires me. I'm mad for him, totally.”\nShe also shared how they got together the first time.\n“He left a very charming, very self-effacing message on the machine,” Parker told the New York Times that same year. “You know, ‘Hi, it's Matthew Broderick.’ You had to use your last name.”\nOn May 19, 1997, the couple tied the knot at New York City's Angel Orensanz Synagogue. They did not prep anyone for a wedding, inviting 100 friends to a party that then turned into a surprise ceremony. \nOn October 28, 2002, the couple welcomed their first child, a baby boy named James Wilkie, after the actor's late grandfather, James Broderick. \nBroderick joins Parker at the premiere of the Sex and the City movie.\nOn June 22, 2009, they welcomed twin girls via surrogate, named Marion and Tabitha. In an interview with Vogue, Parker said the couple “tried and tried and tried to get pregnant” in the conventional way, but it did not work out. \n“I would give birth as often as I could, if I could,” she said. “I cherished all the milestones, the good and the bad.”\nAfter about twenty years together, Parker admitted that things between them weren't always smooth sailing in an interview with The Telegraph.\n“We've been together for 20 years and you have good days, you have decent days, and you have bad days. That's a marriage,” she said. “That's a relationship. That's a friendship, even—relationships outside the marriage run the same course.”\nParker added, “If you're in it for the long haul, and you want meaningful relationships, you are going to go through lots of different periods.”\nBecause of her work as the star of the majorly popular Sex and the City, Parker is generally the one getting interviewed, and Broderick tends to keep a low profile. But while on the Meredith Vieira Show, he talked about why things have worked out for them long-term.\n“We really are friends beyond everything else, and we talk a lot,” he said. “Keep talking, I guess, I know how cliché that is. Too much silence is definitely not a good idea.” \nFor their 20th anniversary, Parker shared a sweet wedding photo on Instagram with the caption, “It flew by Baby. Good golly I love you. XXX, Your wife.”\nParker appeared on an episode of Sophia Amoruso's podcast, Girlboss Radio,  and said she and Broderick often end up being apart for work.\n“I know this sounds nuts, but we have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,” she said. “His work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that's been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share in a way.”\nThe couple finally returned to the stage together again for a Broadway show called Plaza Suite that made it to the pre-run before being shut down by the pandemic. In March 2020, they told WSJ. Magazine that there's a reason they waited so long to bring the band back together.\n“We very rarely both work at the same time,” Broderick explained.\n“This is the first time since we've had three children that we … are even prepared,” Parker added. “And it's hard. We have a son who's about to be away for spring semester. But I say all the time, there are families with parents serving in the military who are away all the time, you know? Just endless, impossible situations.” \nWhile on the SiriusXM show Quarantined with Bruce, Broderick shared another little “secret” to marriage: There is none.\n“I don't know the secret at all, but I'm very grateful, and I love her. It's amazing,” he said.\n“You know, speaking of how talented my wife is, I should also say that getting to do this play, even though we only just did it in Boston for a little while ... she was so, so good in it,” he said. “And I had never acted with her onstage and had never really acted with her at all. And I was just reminded of how funny and smart and what a great comic actor she is—or actor, never mind the comic part.”\nHe added, “She's very good at it. So I hope everybody gets to see her do it.” \nParker is supported by her husband and son at the premiere of And Just Like That...\nParker appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen  and shared that her first kiss with Broderick “was outside an apartment building,” and the second while heading to the subway station.\n“I had a Ricola in my mouth. It was the dead of winter and I thought—well, it just seemed like a third party. So I spit it out into my gloved hand because I was getting on the subway … It was stuck on my glove,” she said.\nAnd it did ruin the glove. \nBroderick took his turn on WWHL with Andy Cohen, and was asked when he knew he wanted to be with Parker forever.\n“Oh, the first time I met her,” he said. “I saw her walking down the street and thought, ‘That's it.’” \nFor their 25th marriage anniversary on May 19, Parker shared an intimate pic with Broderick on Instagram.\nThe couple appeared together at the Hocus Pocus 2 premiere, in which Parker plays evil witch Sarah Sanderson, along with their daughters Tabitha Hodge and Marion Loretta Elwell.\nOn Saturday, May 20, Parker shared a photo of a champagne cork that came out of the celebratory bottle she shared with Broderick for their 26th anniversary. \n“Happy 26th anniversary, my husband,” she wrote in the caption. “That sure was a nice celebration and a real nice bottle of champagne. And a gorgeous walk home.”\nShe added, “Oh the miles we have strolled together. I love you. XOX, your SJ.”\nOn Thursday, October 5, Parker and Broderick walked the red carpet at the New York City Ballet Fall Fashion Gala. In a sweet moment captured by People, Parker stops to check and adjust her husband's bowtie. She was also wearing a long black bow accessory in her hair, which she briefly held up for a comparison to his before they both turned back to pose for photos arm-in-arm.\nParker was wearing a gown by Carolina Herrera with an off-the-shoulder neckline, peekaboo keyhole cutouts down the bodice, and a tulle skirt, along with different color heels in black and nude shades featuring rhinestone studded buckles. She also carried a small silver bucket purse and had a simple black watch on one wrist. Her husband wore a classic suit and glasses. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more. Her first book, The Lonely Hunter, will be released by Dial Press in February 2022.\nAll the Celebrity Break Ups In 2023 (So Far)\nAll About Dalton Gomez, Ariana’s Ex-Husband\nA Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Love\nKhloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson's Romance\nA Timeline of Jessica and Justin's Love Story\nZendaya & Tom Holland's Romance Through the Years\nAll About Dylan Meyer, Kristen Stewart’s Fiancée\nAll About Malcolm, Anya’s Husband\nA Timeline of Prince William and Kate Middleton\nJoe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s Timeline\nMeet Adele's Reported Boyfriend, Rich Paul\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky’s Complete History\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Relationship", "date": "2023-10-08 17:53:00", "text": "One of Hollywood's most beloved couples, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, seem to have a perfectly-balanced relationship—particularly when they take turns lovingly roasting each other on social media. The pair began dating in 2011 and were married about a year later. That might seem fast, but they'd been friends for a while and could simply no longer deny the chemistry between them.\nMore than a decade later, Lively and Reynolds remain happily married and share three daughters—James, Inez, and Betty—and their fourth baby, whose name and gender haven't been shared yet. \nHere, the complete history of Lively and Reynolds' love story.\nLively and Reynolds met through work. The two starred in the superhero movie Green Lantern but didn't date at the time. They both were actually in other relationships. Lively was dating her Gossip Girl co-star Penn Badgley, while Reynolds was married to Scarlett Johansson, a future on-screen superhero herself. They did appear together for the first time during Comic-Con in San Diego in 2010, preceding the film's release.\nA few months later, Badgley and Lively split after three years together but supposedly remained friends. \nA source told Us Weekly, “They’re professionals. They're still good friends and hang out on the set.” \nThey did not publicize the news of their break up right away, however.\nAt the end of that same year, Reynolds and Johansson released a joint statement to People confirming they were separating, which read, “After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we’ve decided to end our marriage. We entered our relationship with love, and it’s with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn’t expected, it’s certainly appreciated.”\nReynolds filed for divorce a few weeks later in December.\nLively and Reynolds walked the red carpet premiere of Green Lantern in Hollywood on June 15, 2011. There were still no rumors of a romance, and Lively was actually romantically linked to Leonardo DiCaprio. Lively and DiCaprio were first photographed together in Cannes, France that May, and then spent the summer together. But it was a brief fling, and E! reported they ended things when the season changed. \nBut with fall came new love. People reported that Lively and Reynolds were dating shortly before Halloween, when she was seen exiting his apartment in Boston at the crack of dawn after his birthday weekend. A source told People at the time that the two are “very much a couple,” and “they’re really happy together.”\nBy Christmas time, Lively was already familiar with Reynolds' family, visiting his hometown of Vancouver in late December. Paparazzi caught a shot of them holding hands while walking in the streets between family time.\nIn the new year, PopSugar reported the pair went to New Orleans to Reynolds' private home for a romantic getaway.\nThe couple were back in Vancouver in the spring, PopSugar reported. They also ferried to Nanaimo, British Columbia, to meet with Reynolds' brother.\nOn September 9, 2012, Lively and Reynolds got married during a small secret ceremony with friends and family. The bride wore a couture gown designed by Marchesa, and Reynolds was in a classic Burberry suit. \n“When Ryan first saw her, his face broke into a huge smile that crinkled his eyes,” a source told People. “They just stared at each other with absolute love. Their faces were lit up with the candlelight, and it looked like something out of a romance movie.”\nThe couple have since apologized for holding their event at Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Boone Hall is a former plantation, and wedding on one is generally viewed as distasteful and offensive given the site's history.\nReynolds said in an August 2020 interview with Fast Company, “It’s something we’ll always be deeply and unreservedly sorry for. It’s impossible to reconcile. What we saw at the time was a wedding venue on Pinterest. What we saw after was a place built upon devastating tragedy. Years ago, we got married again at home—but shame works in weird ways. A giant f*cking mistake like that can either cause you to shut down or it can reframe things and move you into action. It doesn’t mean you won’t f*ck up again. But repatterning and challenging lifelong social conditioning is a job that doesn’t end.”\nIn 2019, the couple donated $2 million to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights. \nJust after their marriage, Lively told Allure, “Right now, I'm so peaceful. I've never been happier in my life,” she said. It was also her first mention of a family since her marriage.\n“I've always wanted a big family,” she told outlet, answering a question about how many kids she wants with, “Oh, I'd love 30 if I could.” \nThe pair went to Paris for a little PDA, according to some Daily Mail photographs.\nThe pair appeared on the red carpet together for the first time since getting married, attending The Sound of Change Live concert at Twickenham Stadium in London.\nFor Lucky magazine’s September cover, Lively opened up about how marriage was influencing her personal style. Not at all!\n“I was recently asked how my style has changed since I got married, as if I was living under some sort of dictatorship,” she claimed. “I should hope I dress differently at 25 than I did when I graduated high school. I hope I never stop changing.\"\nBut she admitted that Reynolds does influence her in some ways. \n“I'm very lucky to be with someone who has better taste than me. We influence each other in different ways. With film and TV, you don't see the results for months. Building a home, you get immediate gratification.” \nThe couple attended the A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To Cure Parkinson's event benefiting The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research in New York City. Reynolds lost his father to Parkinsons, so the event is close to his heart.\nLively and Reynolds attended their first Met Gala together on May 1, 2014, in New York City, wearing Gucci.\nLively told Vogue that summer that she and Reynolds live in one another's pockets.\n“Everything we do in life, we do together,” she said. “He’s going to be a great father and leader and patriarch—he’s so meant to be all of those things.” \nShe spoke about children again in the September issue of Marie Claire, saying, “He's my best, best friend. What do you do with your best friend? You do nothing. If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would.”\nOn her lifestyle website Preserve, Lively announced she was expecting her first child with Reynolds, sharing a maternity photo.\nLively gave birth to her eldest daughter James in December 2014, though they did not initially share James' name or gender.\nA source told Us Weekly in earlier January, “The baby came early but everyone is happy and healthy.”\nThe big name reveal came from Reynolds during an interview on the Today Show. \n“It's James. Everyone knows. I didn't want to be the first guy screaming it out to the media,” he said. “Because as we know, little girls turn into teenage girls and little teenage girls sometimes scan through the archives and go, ‘Why did you do that?’”\nA couple months later, Reynolds shared a photo of baby James' hand. He captioned it, “Thumb wrestling isn’t always fair. Curiously, my hand is the small one.”\nThe couple began to get more goofy on social media in the following years, and that Chirstmas, Reynolds shared a present from his wife on Instagram with the caption, “Mrs @blakelively had this made by AdoraWools. Nothing says ‘I love you’ like a felt #Deadpool, holding a chimichanga while riding a Unicorn dressed in ass-less leather chaps. Amaright fellas?” \nIn February 2016, Reynolds' massive hit Deadpool premiered, and the couple walked the red carpet event together, their first major appearance since having a kid.\nWhile at the amFar New York Gala a few days later, Reynolds Entertainment Weekly that his first date with Lively was actually a double date because they were just “buddies.”\nHe said, “About a year after Green Lantern had come and gone, and we were both single we went on a double date–she was on a date with another guy, and I was on a date with another girl and it was like the most awkward date for the respective parties because we were just like fireworks coming across.”\nLively and Reynolds looked stunning State Dinner at the White House in Washington, D.C.\nMoving towards Lively's joke goal of 30 children, Us Weekly reported the couple were expecting their second child in April 2016. Lively was filming The Shallows at the time, and photos from set show her small baby bump.\nLively told Marie Claire that she knew Reynolds “would always be my best friend for my whole life” in a July 2016 cover story.\nShe continued, “I'd never known anything like the friendship that I had with him. I could like him as much as I loved him.”\nWhen asked what she was protective of, she replied,“My family: That's the thing that I feel most protective of and the thing that I feel is the most exposed when I feel exploited. Ryan had a nice, normal upbringing, and we want our kids to have the same normal life that we had. We don't ever want to rob them of what we had, because we'd feel really selfish.”\nTheir second child is born that September, as Page Six reported at the time. Once again, they keep their second daughter's name under wraps until Us Weekly revealed it to be Inez several months later.\nDuring an interview for GQ’s December cover, Reynolds was asked when he knew Lively was the one.\n“Probably after the sex,” he joked. “No, we were hanging out at this little restaurant in Tribeca that's open really late, and this song came on, and I was just like, ‘Want to dance?’ No one was in there, so it was just totally empty. And it was just one of those moments where halfway through the dance, it was like, ‘Oh, I think I just crossed a line.’ And then I walked her home. And, uh, you know, I don't really need to go into what happened after that.”\nWhen asked if he remembered what the special song was, he answered, “I do, but I'm not gonna say. You're shut out.”\nThe two girls made their red carpet debut with their parents when Reynolds was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nOnce again, Reynolds and Lively attended the Met Gala looking fabulous in New York City.\nLively and Reynolds are busy parents and busy actors, but they balance their hectic schedule.\n“My husband and I don’t work at the same time, so we all go together as a family,” she told People. “If we’re away as a family, it’s never more than for a day. We stay together.” And the kids go on set.\nShe added, “I’m not in an office where I can’t do that, so she’s either with me or when I’m shooting a scene, she’s one room away. If she really needs me, I can pop over there.”\nReynolds celebrated Valentine’s Day by sharing a photo of a delicious cake he made, joking the icing was glue in the caption. It was for his wife, of course.\nNow on year seven together, rumors surfaced that the couple might not be getting along too well, but Reynolds cleared things up by tweeting, “I wish. I could use a little ‘me time.’”\nI wish. I could use a little “me time”. https://t.co/S6kXFsWaMe\nWhile promoting Lively's new movie A Simple Favor, Reynolds teased his wife for answers to the film's mysteries on Twitter, and she answered, “Oh darling, of all the secrets I’m keeping from you, this should be the LEAST of your concerns... trust me.”\nOh darling, of all the secrets I’m keeping from you, this should be the LEAST of your concerns... trust me.\nFor the red carpet premiere of Reynolds’ project Detective Pikachu, the pair also premiered their new pregnancy. Lively wore a stunning yellow gown that showed off her figure and their expectation of a third child.\nIn October 2019, Lively and Reynolds welcomed their third child, a daughter named Betty, though her name wasn't revealed for quite a while—until it appeared on their friend Taylor Swift's album folklore.\nTaylor Swift loves to drop Easter eggs in her projects, and her fans guessed that when they heard the names James and Inez, the third baby's name must be somewhere in the lyrics of folklore track “Betty.” Indeed, Betty is the title of the song about fictional characters named after all three of Reynolds and Lively's daughters at that point.\n“She said ‘James, get in, let's drive,’” Swift sings, and, “You heard the rumors from Inez / You can't believe a word she says.”\nCanadian-born Reynolds got his American citizenship shortly before the 2020 elections, and the couple voted early together. Lively shared a photo of herself with him, writing in the caption, “It was Ryan’s first time. He was understandably scared. It all happened so fast. Like, REALLY fast. He wept. I pretended to weep. Then he called all his friends.”\nReynolds tells Access Hollywood that he loves “being a girl dad.” \n“I try to be as present as possible. I shoot movies, and my wife shoots movies, and we go travel all over the place, and we just all go together,” he said. “I think that that’s been the best part of it. We really don’t spend a lot of time apart. I get to spend a lot of time with my girls.”\nHe added, “I come from all boys. I have three older brothers. So for me to have three daughters has been such a ride, and I love every second of it.”\nThe couple shared on Instagram that they were getting their COVID-19 vaccinations.\nReynolds wished his wife a happy Mother’s Day with a photo of them cuddled up together, writing in the caption that Lively was the “heart and soul of every moment their family shares.”\nReynolds shared more about how he made the first move on Lively while on SmartLess podcast. He recalled how when he and Lively met up in Boston, their friendship became something “out of a fairy tale.”\n“I met Blake on the darkest crease in the anus of the universe called Green Lantern,” he joked. “We were friends and buddies, and about a year and a half later, we went on a double date, but we were dating separate people.”\nHe and Lively had “always kind of kept in touch sort of casually.” \n“Next thing you know, she was going to Boston, I was going to Boston and I said, ‘Well, I'll ride with you.’ We got on the train and we rode together. I was just begging her to sleep with me,” he claimed. \nWhen asked what his big move was, he said, “I would use a little bit of tear stick so I could get the tears kind of rolling…then I would tell a little sob story about my life.” \nIn August, the couple walked the red carpet together for the premiere of Reynolds' video game movie Free Guy, with Lively wearing Prabal Gurung dress and Lorraine Schwartz jewels.\nLater that same month, Reynolds said in SiriusXM interview, per the Daily Mail, that thecouple trusted Taylor Swift “implicitly” with sharing youngest daughter's name.\n“We thought it was pretty damn amazing. We still do,” he said. “I still walk down the street and shake my head thinking, ‘I can't believe that happened.’” \nHe continued, “The names are the names of our kids. We trust [Taylor] implicitly. She's very sensitive to any of that stuff.”\nReynolds also explained that the song “has nothing to do with our kids other than our kids' names.”  \nThe couple were “surprised,” and they had “no idea” until they listened to the song the first time.\nReynolds shared more about how he and Lively keep their romance alive after a decade together in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. The secret ingredient is friendship.\n“We don’t take each other too seriously, but we're also friends,” he said. “Falling in love is great, but do you like each other? That's kinda the question you gotta ask yourself, you know, going into it. We've always liked each other. We grow together. We learn from each other. So yeah, I'm lucky to have a buddy in that.”\nSpeaking of friendships, the pair celebrated Taylor Swift's musical guest spot on Saturday Night Live that month. They were joined by Swift's ex Joe Jonas, his wife Sophie Turner, and Selena Gomez. The group attened the SNL afterparty at L'Avenue.\nThe next day, Swift dropped a teaser for new video for “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),” which was directed by Lively.\n“SURPRISE! NEW MUSIC VIDEO TOMORROW at 10am ET,” Swift announced on her Instagram. “I finally got to work with the brilliant, brave, & wickedly funny @blakelively on her directorial debut. Join us as we raise a toast, and a little hell.”\nAfter a busy year, Reynolds said he'd be taking a break from acting to be more available to his family in an interview with LinkedIn News Senior Editor at Large Jessi Hempel.\n“I want my kids to have a pretty normal schedule,” he explained. “For many years when my wife Blake would shoot a film, I would not shoot a film and I would be with the kids and vice versa. So we would sort of trade off. We never really worked at the same time. But always we were away. So the kids were away too.”\nHe continued, “Now that they're in school, they have a somewhat normal schedule. I think it's totally important for their development, and I really enjoy being a present dad. I love taking them to school in the morning; I love picking them up.”\nThe couple were seen out on a casual date in New York City on January 24, bundled up for a cozy day on the town.\nReynolds shared a picture of himself on the beach in matching blue pajamas, holding a white mug and smiling, which he credited to his wife on Instagram. It offered a little glimpse into their married life. \nAfter many years of being attendees, the couple were co-chairs of the Met Gala in 2022, where the theme of the night was “Gilded Glamour.” Lively wore a crown and a custom Atelier Versace dress, and Reynolds wore a black tuxedo. \nA video of Reynolds’ reacting to seeing Lively in her outfit for the first time went viral on @21MetGala’s Twitter, and it's pretty adorable.\nTo celebrate Lively's birthday on August 25, Reynolds posted a TikTok of him and Mariah Carey, writing, “My favorite thing that's ever happened on August 25th.” \nThe couple announced that they were expecting a fourth child when Lively stepped out for the Forbes Power Women's Summit, where she was being honored, and her pregnancy was very evident.\nTo get the paparazzi off her back, Lively shared her own pregnancy photos on Instagram as well.\n“Here are photos of me pregnant in real life so the 11 guys waiting outside my home for a 🦄 sighting will leave me alone,” she wrote. “You freak me and my kids out. Thanks to everyone else for all the love and respect and for continuing to unfollow accounts and publications who share photos of children. You have all the power against them. And thank you to the media who have a ‘No Kids Policy’. You all make all the difference 🙏♥️. Much love! Xxb.”\nFor the holiday, Reynolds released a new version of the classic tale A Christmas Carol with comedian Will Ferrell, a musical title Spirited. The actor shared one of his much-needed choreography lessons on Instagram, joking, “You’ve got to be willing to be bad at something if you want to be… slightly less bad at it? Here’s Will and I proving that point!” \nReynolds might not have thought much of his moves, but Lively was all over it.\n“Can you get pregnant while pregnant??” she asked in the comments section.\nReynolds took the time during his People's Choice Award speech to gush about his family, after giving a thanks to his “work family.”\n“I’ve got to thank my family family,” he said, via Buzzfeed. “Blake and my three daughters. It’s going to be a fourth child very soon. If it happens tonight, while I’m here, I will be looking for a couch to sleep on for a little while. I'd venture to guess that [People's Choice Award performer] Shania Twain has an amazing couch, I'm just saying.” \n“But Blake and my girls, you are quite literally my heart,” he continued. “You are my hope, you are my happiness. I joke that my family exhaust me, but in reality, you give me more strength than any man could possibly deserve.”\nIn December, Reynolds also posted a photo of meeting Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus. \n“We met Jessica Claus and her husband on the Polar Express. She was everything I’d always dreamed since I was a kid. She smelled like cinnamon buns and sangria. 🎄,” he captioned it. \nOn January 2, Lively shared another pregnancy pic for her fans.\nHer other big news for the month was that she'd been cast as red-headed Lily in the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's mega hit It Ends With Us. After Deadline reported her casting, Lively posted an Instagram Story of herself with red hair, set to Smashing Pumpkin's song “Lily (My One and Only).” \nBaby #4 arrived...although the child's name, gender, and birth date were kept private. Lively subtly revealed during Super Bowl Sunday that she had given birth to their newest addition when she shared a photo of herself visibly not pregnant.\nReynolds discussed how he and Lively were doing in mid-February, declining to share the child's gender during an interview with CNBC’s Power Lunch. “We’re very excited,” Reynolds said. “Look, we wouldn’t do this four times if we didn’t love it. Everybody’s doing great. Everybody’s actually doing fantastic. If we hadn’t figured it out by now, I think we’d be in deep, deep trouble.”\nPresenting the 2022 CNBC Stock Draft Champions:@VancityReynolds and @weareMNTN's Mark Douglas They join to talk why they chose Netflix and Ford in the draft, recap the ads and marketing landscape after The Super Bowl, and other business ventures they're involved in pic.twitter.com/p9keg7Jwc5\nLively shared a look at her husband's summer physique—and made headlines for the “extra spicy” commentary she added to the photo. It marked a rare moment of public flirting for the pair.\nReynolds marked Lively’s 36th birthday on August 25 with a very romantic tribute full of never-before-seen pics of the couple. “The only thing irrevocably mine in the world is the love and appreciation and awe I feel for this person,” he wrote. “Witnessing her life is something I couldn’t take for granted if I tried. And believe me, I try. Happy Birthday, @blakelively. You hung the damn moon.”\nOn Sunday, October 1, the couple joined friend Taylor Swift in New Jersey for the New York Jets game. Swift's rumored love interested Travis Kelce was playing against the Jets with the Kansas City Chiefs, and she filled out the VIP box with other celebrities. In addition to Lively and Reynolds, she was joined by Hugh Jackman, Sophie Turner, Sabrina Carpenter, and Brittany Mahomes.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "All About Taylor Lautner’s Wife Taylor Dome", "date": "2023-10-08 17:38:00", "text": "Twilight’s Taylor Lautner found his other half in another Taylor. Taylor Dome has officially changed her last name to “Lautner” since their marriage, but to help with some confusion, she’ll be referred here by her maiden name. It’s an issue they deal with themselves, as they’re happy to joke about. In fact, when Lautner appeared in a Taylor Swift music video, the three Taylors recreated the Spider-Man meme about finding your doppëlganger.\nThe Lautners are very open about their lives and marriage, and even have their own podcast together, The Squeeze. But here’s some info on Dome and how her and Lautner’s marriage came to be.\nDome is a registered nurse, completing her studies in 2019. She has also been working on her profile as an influencer, launching LEMONS by Tay in January 2022, a site dedicated to self-care and mental health. \nShe was also once a huge Twilight fan. She shared a hilarious throwback photo of herself in November 2020 wearing a Twilight sweatshirt with the hashtag “#tbt #twilightforever.”\nIn June 2022, she shared a video about who her childhood crush was, and it turns out Dome was once Team Edward.\nAnd yet, she ended up with Jacob Black. Lautner commented on the post, “Bout time I won something.” \nDome is a good friend of Makena Moore, Lautner’s sister, and she introduced them.\n“My sister Makena actually introduced us,” he said in an interview. “She called me and said, ‘Dude, I found your future wife. You need to meet this girl.’ And the rest is history.”\nWhile doing an interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2022, he told Clarkson, “It’s just me and my sister so we’re super close, and she always said that she was gonna introduce me to my future wife, and I was like, ‘Sure.’”\nAt the time of the intro, Lautner had taken a break from acting.\n“I wanted to take a step back and enjoy life and spend some time with my family and friends,” he told People. “And I met my fiancée out of it, so it all worked out.”\nThey connected during a game night, he explained. \n“I love game nights. She’s [Moore] like, ‘Throw a game night, invite me and some of my friends over, and I’ll bring Tay. She’ll just be one of them, and you guys can just meet,’” he said. “We hit it off, and the rest is history.”\nThey shared that they were dating in 2018, and Lautner proposed in November 2021. They were married on November 11, 2022 in at Epoch Estate Wines outside of Paso Robles, California. Lautner wore a Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo, and Dome wore a Winnie Couture A-line gown.\nLautner described his proposal to Access Hollywood, saying, “She always has said, ‘I don’t want anything special. I don’t want anything big and grand. Do it in the kitchen...I love cooking, so I make us food all the time in the kitchen and we just eat at the counter. And she’s like, ‘One night after we eat in the kitchen, that’s all I want. Simple.’”\nBut he couldn’t stop himself from doing a little more.\n“I got tons of flowers and candles and a sign. So when she came home at the end of the day, after a long day of work, she walked into that,” he said. “It was a lovely surprise.”\nHe added, “It actually did take her a little longer than expected to say ‘yes’ because she was weeping so hard. She couldn't even walk up to me. So I was on my mark and I have to leave the mark to go get her to lift her up from crying … It took a sec, but it was super sweet.”\nFor Dome’s 26th birthday, Lautner gave her a tattoo session. They got matching tattoos of their wedding date “11.11.22” on their left wrists.\nThey made their first red carpet appearance together in April 2022, at the CMT Awards.\nOn The Kelly Clarkson Show, Lautner shared his wife’s plans to officially change her last name joking, “Cause we already share one name, so it’s gonna be extra complicated,” adding, “I’m a narcissist.” \nOn Wednesday, October 4, the two Taylors attended the Inaugural Rare Impact Fund Benefit which was hosted by Selena Gomez. They wore chic color coordinated outfits in black, with Lautner donning a two piece velvet ensemble with satin details and short sleeves and a pair of matching black shoes. His wife was in a strapless black gown with a thigh-high split up the skirt. She had a black-and-white blazer hung over her shoulders. On her feet were a pair of nude high-heeled sandals.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Ciara and Russell Wilson's Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-08 16:21:00", "text": "It seems like Ciara and Russell Wilson have been together forever, but they actually met in 2015, and were married only a year after they first connected. Together, the musical artist and Broncos star share three children: their daughter Sienna Princess, their son Win Harrison Wilson, and Ciara's son Future Zahir Wilburn from her former relationship with the rapper Future, whom Wilson treats as his own. \nHere's their complete relationship timeline so far.\nThe couple met on March 26, 2015, while at a basketball game at the University of Wisconsin. BET reports that Wilson asked Ciara out for dinner, seeing if she could meet him after a business meeting, but she said it was too late. He changed his plans.\n“I completely forgot about the 10:30 [P.M.] dinner,” he said. “Next thing I knew, it was 12:00 [A.M.], 12:30 [A.M.], and I was sold on you.” \nOnly a month later, they made their first official appearance together at the White House, during an event for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie Abe. \nThings went well, and soon, they were walking the red carpet at the BET Awards. \nThe couple made headlines when Wilson shared that they had decided to remain celibate until marriage. \n“I told somebody that’s the girl I want to be with before I even met her,” he explained during an interview with San Diego's The Rock Church. “Before I met her, I was like, ‘I’m probably going to end up with Ciara.’”\nHe continued, “She was in the dressing room getting ready to go before she went on stage, and she was sitting there, and God spoke to me and said, ‘I need you to lead her.’ And I was like, ‘Really?’ And he was like, ‘No, I want you to lead her.’ So I told her, ‘What would you do if we took all of that extra stuff off the table and just did it Jesus's way?’”\nHe added, “I ain't going to lie to you all now. I need you all to pray for us. I know you've seen her on the screen. If there's a 10, she's a 15.” \nThe couple made an appearance at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards at UCLA, which Wilson was hosting.\nCiara told Cosmopolitan more about their celibacy decision, saying, “You get to hug and you get to have a nice good kiss, but you have to be careful not to go too far so you don't end up in the place you're trying to avoid being in. Strong, strong, strong, strong! Just the strongest resistance to temptation.”\nIn another interview that month with People, Ciara said, “I’m not gonna lie. I’m human, so it is not easy, especially when I look at him, and I think he is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen—that I’ve ever laid my eyes on, to be honest.”\nThey also attended the pre-GRAMMY Gala together and posed for this iconic photo.\nA year after meeting, Wilson proposed to Ciara while they were on a trip in the Seychelles with a 16-carat custom diamond ring, according to Us Weekly. \n“She said Yes!!! Since Day 1 I knew you were the one. No Greater feeling... #TrueLove @Ciara,” he posted on Instagram on March 11, confirming their engagement.\nThey were married a few months later on July 6 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England, surrounded by friends and family. She wore a Roberto Cavalli gown with custom embroidery, bell lace sleeves, and a laced-up bodice, while Wilson was in a Giorgio Armani suit, People reported at the time. Celebs at the event included Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. \n“We are The Wilsons!” Ciara wrote over a photo from the day.\nCiara told People, “Our wedding was like a fairytale... We loved the countryside. We looked at a venue in the U.S., but we also looked abroad, and England just seemed magical and perfect.”\nShe added, “This is the happiest I have ever been.”\nThat fall, the couple announced they were expecting. Ciara shared the news on her 31st birthday, writing on Instagram, “On this special Birthday I received an abundance of love from friends and family.. and I'm excited to Finally share one of the Greatest Gifts of All that God could give... 👶🏽🍼💃🏽☺️❤️”\nWearing a floor-length red velvet gown from Jovani Signature to the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in February 2017, Ciara's pregnancy was very visible, and she looked radiant.\nTheir daughter Sienna was born on April 29, 2017.\n“Dear Sienna Princess Wilson, No matter how big the wave, we will always be your calm in the storm. We Love You. Love, Mommy & Daddy,” Ciara wrote on Instagram.\nThey shared the first photos of Sienna months later.\nCiara told E! that since marriage and welcoming a new child, her home has “been full of so much life and love.”\n“He's been such an incredible father since day one,” she said of Wilson's parenting skills. “He's so loving and very patient. He also likes to have fun—he's very spontaneous and we just have a good time as a family... He inspires me, he's so driven and very ambitious, and he's always working hard whether he's on the field or off the field.”\nShe added, “He's always trying to make an impact in any way that he can. It's really inspiring to watch and to have a partner that has that kind of ambition. I'm also a very ambitious person, I'm very driven...it really just flows.”  \nTwo years after their wedding, the couple went on an official honeymoon in Botswana, Africa.\n“I could wake up like this every morning,” the singer wrote over a safari video.\nShortly after, the couple launched Why Not You productions to develop both scripted and unscripted TV and movie projects. \n“While we work in different fields in our day-to-day, we are excited to come together to collaborate and create stories that we hope will touch people’s lives,” they said in a joint statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “We are both storytellers at heart and we want to be able to share stories that uplift people and inspire others to create positive change. That’s ultimately what we want this company to represent.” \nWhile promoting her new album Beauty Marks on The View, Ciara shared more about her relationship. \n“When you allow yourself to be vulnerable, you become your strongest,” she said. “When I met the love of my life it was not only loving me, it was to love my son.”\nLater that month, she told Access Hollywood, “You know my husband’s pretty awesome and you know it’s been an incredible journey...Time goes by so fast and we’ve been having the time of our lives. We call it organized chaos because obviously with him doing football and me doing music, the worlds are both moving fast and kinda like in two different directions, but sometimes parallel at the same time.”   \nIn January 2020, Ciara announced she and Wilson were expecting again. \n“Number 3,” she captioned a shot of herself in a bathing suit featuring a baby bump.\nOn July 23, their son Win Harrison was born. \n“Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy & Daddy Love You!” Wilson wrote on Instagram.\nCiara also shared a video of herself with the new arrival.\nCiara honored her husband at the 2021 Met Gala by wearing his jersey number in Seahawks green on a gown by Dundas while wearing his Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XLVIII and carriying a football clutch covered in crystals\nThe couple released a children's book together titled Why Not You?, encouraging kids to dream big. It is an extension of their shared Why Not You Foundation.\nCiara told People that young Future loves football, and Wilson has been helping him train.\n“He's all about the details. He's all about the technique,” she said. “He's firm with love though...He's all about coming back with love and so it's beautiful.”\nCiara brought Future and Sienna to watch Wilson play for the Denver Broncos in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAt the end of a difficult season with the Broncos, Ciara wrote her husband a loving message of support on Instagram.\n“This season has been a roller coaster ride like no other… I've watched you endure so much and keep your head up high through it all! Your faith, belief, and confidence never wavered!” she wrote. “What I do know is a Winner is someone that gets back up when they're knocked down, someone who doesn't stop believing. Someone who embraces adversity and stays neutral through it all. Someone who can't be influenced by the words or opinions of others. Someone who loves loving others, serving others, and is always there for his family. All of that you are!” \nCiara announced she was pregnant with her and Wilson's third child together and her fourth overall. She wrote on Instagram, “‘You look at me like that again, we make another kid… You my heart I’m your rib’ ”\nA source told People that Ciara and Wilson were looking to keep expanding their family. “She loves being a mother so this is what she loves doing,” the source said. “This is what she has always wanted, and Russ too. They've always wanted a lot of kids.”\nCiara made an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast in October, and discussed her pregnancy and plans for the future with Wilson. First, she told host Alex Cooper about the early days of their courtship and keeping things private to start.\n“It was the best thing for the both of us, we felt,” she said. “Because even though we were meeting as friends and all that stuff, my son was there and my dad was there.”\nShe added, “We were, like, talking and talking and talking and it was crazy. Everything that we talked about, like, we were aligned on...I knew that I'd never felt what I felt in that moment.”\nCiara also talked about Wilson as a dad.\n“He's an amazing father,” she said. “Watching him with all of our kids—it is one of the sweetest things. It's one of the sexiest things, to be honest with you. I'm just saying, ladies, when a man jumps in and changes the diaper, and he's pulling up to teacher-parent conferences, it's like, ‘Ooh!’”\nShe added, “There's something about a man turning on that part of them, like, they're being a man for you but they're also being a man for your family. There's no better feeling than knowing that.”\nCooper joked about the pair planning baby number five, but Ciara quickly responded, “Don't get crazy now. Let's go one baby at a time.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson's Relationship", "date": "2023-10-08 15:49:00", "text": "Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson were first linked together in 2016, and have had many ups and downs during the past six years. In that time, they had two children together, a four-year-old daughter named True Thompson and a boy born via surrogate in summer 2022. His name has not yet been revealed publicly. \nRelationship status-wise, Kardashian and Thompson are off for now but have been on-off romantically throughout their history.\nIf you've found their relationship confusing, this timeline of their big moments together might help to keep everything straight. \nAugust 2016\nKhloé and Tristan were first spotted together leaving LA's Bootsy Bellows nightclub in the summer of 2016. Khloé later explained that they were set up on a surprise blind date by their mutual friend Brandon Jennings.\n“I was at the Bel-Air hotel. [Tristan] came to the dinner because I didn't want to go on a blind date, so Brandon kind of ambushed the blind date,” she said. “So, I had a bunch of people, and he brought him, and we just connected.”\nSeptember 2016\nA month later,  Khloé and Tristan headed to Mexico for a couple's getaway and were photographed holding hands in Miami that same month, eventually attending Flo Rida’s birthday party at LIV together.\nOctober 2016\nIn October, the couple coordinated their costumes for Halloween, going as Marvel's Storm and the Black Panther.\nNovember 2016\nBy November of that year, Khloé was living part-time in Cleveland to be close to Tristan, which she raved about during an interview with Jimmy Kimmel.\n“I live [in Los Angeles], but I’m [in Cleveland] very often,” she said. “I actually really do [like being in Cleveland]. I actually really like it. I like just having my routine and being a little more under the radar. It’s nice.”\nDecember 2016\nIn December, Khloé shared a photo of herself and Tristan in matching camouflage coats, embracing in a hallway. She captioned the photo, “Him,” adding a heart emoji.\nJanuary 2017\nThe couple celebrated the new year together, kissing at midnight and sharing the pics on Instagram.\nMarch 2017\nBy 2017, Tristan was showing up in episodes of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. During his first appearance, he was at Khloé's side when she headed to a Kanye West concert to meet the family, annoying her sister Kim Kardashian.\nApril 2017\nIn an interview with Es Magazine, Khloé said she had “never been in this type of love.” \n“I would love to have a family. We’ve talked about it … I know for a fact that he would be an impeccable father,” she said. “I definitely want to be a mom. But I don’t put the pressure on it. It’s not like, ‘The clock is ticking.’ I feel in my soul it will happen.”\nJune 2017\nIn June, Khloé posted more kissing pics with Tristan, calling him her “king.”\nAugust 2017\nShe went with a kissing pic again to celebrate their one year anniversary.\nDecember 2017\nThe couple announced that they were expecting in late 2017.\n“My greatest dream realized!” Khloé wrote on Instagram. “We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can't believe that our love created life! Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!!”\nShe continued, “You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you've been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love! Thank you to everyone for the love and positive vibes! I know we've been keeping this quiet but we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately. To enjoy our first precious moments just us. Thank you all for understanding. I am so thankful, excited, nervous, eager, overjoyed and scared all in one! But it's the best bundle of feelings I've ever felt in my life!”\nJanuary 2018\nTo celebrate the beginning of another new year together, Khloé posted a picture of her and Tristan captioned “mom and dad.”\nFebruary 2018\nThe couple had a huge Valentine's Day celebration together just months before the birth of True.\nOn April 12, 2018, True was born, but the huge event was somewhat overshadowed by videos of Tristan appearing on TMZ and the Daily Mail, showing him being intimate with another woman. The story broke just before True's birth, and Page Six identified the woman Tristan was seen kissing at PH-D Lounge in NYC as 28-year-old model Lani Blair.\nBlair was reportedly seen at his NBA team's hotel, the Four Seasons, and spent “four hours” there before they headed to Soho House together, then returned to the hotel around 5 A.M. the next morning.\nWitnesses told Page Six that Thompson was “looking around cautiously…and holding the door for her” at the hotel. Blair was later seen leaving on Monday night 8 P.M. with a Louis Vuitton overnight bag.\nShortly after The Mail's story was released, TMZ produced another video dated from back in October, of Thompson with two other women.\nThe next month,  it was reported that Khloé and Tristan were trying to work things out. The new parents were spotted at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland as Tristan's team the Cavaliers played against the Toronto Raptors, TMZ reported.\nKhloe Kardashian Shows Up at Cavaliers Game to Support Tristan Thompson https://t.co/FZeCm8FXKQ\nThey were also spotted having lunch at TownHall restaurant in Cleveland.\nPeople reported Tristan and Khloé were together again in the house, with a source saying, “Khloé seems happy. She loves being a mom. She’s focused on keeping her family together. She seems okay with Tristan—there’s no talk of a split.”\n“When she wants something to work, she will make it work,” the source explained. “Her family’s issue with Tristan is that they think he won’t change. But Khloé isn’t listening to this. She has been very firm with Tristan, and she believes he wants to keep his family together as well.”\nKhloé commented for the first time on Twitter about her relationship in response to a fan wondering why she didn't leave “that wasteman Tristan.” The fan wrote, “She preaches about women knowing their self worth and when to walk away, but when it's time to walk the walk, she's a hypocrite.”\nKardashian responded directly to the fan, tweeting, “Not exactly Queen Persia, you have no knowledge of what goes on in our household or the enormous rebuilding this takes to even coexist. I’m proud of my strength. I appreciate your opinion and I hope you hold that same opinion to everyone else who has stayed in situations.” \nThings apparently were rocky, with an insider telling People and Us Weekly that Khloé and Tristan were together but growing apart.\n“Khloé and Tristan are still not fully okay,” Us’ source said. “They act like they are when they’re in front of others, but it’s all a show at this point.”\nA second source told Us that Tristan was unhappy. \n“Tristan is feeling trapped in a bad relationship. He’s no longer going with Khloé for [couple’s therapy] sessions. He just didn’t feel it was helping to discuss sh-t that happened months ago.”\nKhloé was frustrated too, according to the source.\n“Khloé carried his child and is much more in the limelight than he is, and she doesn’t think he understands the consequences of his decisions,” the source explained. \"She thinks the cheating scandal is a way bigger deal than he does, and he doesn’t fully understand the repercussions of his actions affecting not only him and Khloé but the entire family as a whole.\"\nShe was particularly sensitive because her ex-husband Lamar Odom was guilty of the same transgression. A source told People that Tristan was having trouble adjusting to being in the limelight.\n“When he got with Khloé, he tried to adapt to the best of his ability, but he struggled with being part of such a high-profile family and crossed lines he shouldn’t have,” People's source said. “He wasn’t expecting such major backlash from the public and it’s been a lot for him to handle.”\nKhloé spent Thanksgiving in Cleveland with Tristan and True, away from her family. Fans were suspicious that the Kardashians and Jenner don't want him around. \nShe responded to that by tweeting, “Y’all are reaching now. I’ve spent the past 3 years in Cleveland for Thanksgiving. Not sure why people are trying to create drama between my family and I. My sisters and I are perfectly fine thank you! All of their families were able to travel but TT being in season, he can not.”\nY’all are reaching now. I’ve spent the past 3years in Cleveland for Thanksgiving. Not sure why people are trying to create drama between my family and I. My sisters and I are perfectly fine thank you! All of their families were able to travel but TT being in season, he can not\nShe later added, “The truth is never as fun as some story some of you like to create. So here we goooooooooooo!! Happy Thanksgiving I guess lol.”\nTMZ reports that the couple had split over allegations that Tristan was seen kissing Jordyn Woods, Kylie Jenner's best friend at the time, just after spending Valentine's Day with Khloé.\nThe basketball star was reportedly seen “snuggling up” and “making out” with Jordyn Woods at a house party, and when Khloé found out, the source said, “she has had enough.”\n“FAKE NEWS,” Tristan initially tweeted just after the news broke.\nThe week before, E! reported that though they were technically together, it didn't necessarily look good.\n“She chooses not to worry about it or to classify their relationship anymore,” E!'s source explained, saying Khloé was mostly in Los Angeles while Tristan toured with his team, and that she is “very happy with things the way they are and feels very fulfilled. She doesn't need to think about what's up with Tristan or what he's doing out on the road like she used to.” \nLater that month, Woods appeared on Red Table Talk episode with Jada Pinkett Smith for Facebook Watch, where she described her encounter with him. She said, “But, on the way out [of Tristan's house] he did kiss me. No passion, no nothing. On the way out he just kissed me. It was a kiss on the lips. No tongue kiss, no making out. Nothing. I don't think he's wrong either, because I allowed myself to be in this position.”\nShe continued, “I didn't know how to feel. I was like, ‘That didn't just happen,’ because I was leaving already so I walked out immediately after. And I got in the car and was like, ‘No, that didn't happen,’ I [told him] I need to go. I was in shock.”\nKhloé tweeted out that she did not blame Woods the way she blamed Tristan for what happened.\nTristan is equally to blame but Tristan is the father of my child. Regardless of what he does to me I won’t do that to my daughter. He has been addressing this situation PRIVATELY. If Tristan were to lie publicly about what conspired,then yes I would address him publicly as well\nThis has been an awful week & I know everyone is sick of hearing about it all (as am I). I’m a rollercoaster of emotions & have said things I shouldn’t have. Honestly, Tristan cheating on me & humiliating me, wasn’t such a shock as the first time.\nWhat’s been harder & more painful is being hurt by someone so close to me. Someone whom I love & treat like a little sister. But Jordyn is not to be blamed for the breakup of my family. This was Tristan’s fault.\nI have to move on with my life & count my blessings, my family, my health, & my beautiful baby True.\nPeople interviewed a source who said that Khloé is “great.”\n“Her heartbreak seems to have passed and her mood is much lighter,” they continued. “Although she really wanted Tristan to come around, grow up and be a man, she seems to have realized that she’s much better off now. Everyone is happy to see her happier.”\nThey added, “Khloé isn’t dating, but at least she’s able to talk and joke about dating. She realizes with True around now, she just needs to be super picky. True [Kardashian's daughter with Thompson] will always be Khloé’s life and number one. Khloé is obsessed with her little girl. She really is the most wonderful mom.”\nTristan spoke out against rumors that his relationship with Khloé overlapped with his and ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig's relationship. Craig was pregnant with the couple's child Prince when he first started seeing Khloé.\n“When I met Khloe I was SINGLE,” he wrote on Twitter. “The negative comments that are constantly being directed towards her are unnecessary. She does not deserve all this backlash for my wrong doings. Both Khloè and Jordan have been nothing but great mothers to my kids.”\nDuring a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest, Khloe stated that she doesn’t hold a grudge against her ex or Jordyn Woods.\n“I’m not someone who holds a grudge. If I do that it’s only going to affect me,” she said. “That chapter is closed for me. I want all of us to move on and to be happy, successful people. I just want everyone to just be better people with each day. That’s genuinely how I feel.”\nShe added, “I know everybody makes mistakes. I think it’s how you handle it, and I think apologies need to be as loud as your disrespect was or to me, it’s not sincere. I’m forgiving. I’m forgiven.” \n“We’re all human beings and we’re all figuring out life,” she said. “Stuff happens and people make mistakes, and as long as it doesn’t define who they are—as long as they don’t make those choices define them and they try to evolve and become better people—we’re all gonna survive. We all learn from it.”\nIn July of the following year after spending some time in lockdown together, it was rumored by People that the former couple was “giving their relationship another try. Tristan is working hard to prove himself and has been a great dad to True.”\nA second source said they “acted like [they] were back together” during her birthday that summer, and he wrote a glowing tribute to her on social media.\n\"I’m wise enough now to know, you came into my life to show me just what it means to be an incredible person,\" he stated. \"I appreciate how I am able to learn from and grow because of you. I thank God for the beautiful and loving woman you are to everyone, especially our daughter True. You deserve the world Koko! True and I love you mama. Happy Birthday @khloekardashian ❤️🥳”\nBy February 2021, the pair were supposedly back in a committed relationship, and a source told Entertainment Tonight, “Khloé forgives Tristan at this point, but she will never forget. They are back to being committed, are still in love and giving their relationship another chance and hoping that it will succeed this time around. Tristan has been paying extra attention to Khloe and True and has been calling, FaceTiming, texting and sending photos all the time to check in when they are not physically together. He hasn’t been going out late at night with the boys or other girls.”\nA month later, they went Instagram official for a second time, with Khloé wishing him a happy 30th birthday today on Instagram.\nShe wrote to her boyfriend, “The ones that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is designed to tear them apart and they come out even stronger than they were before. Thank you for showing me everything you said you would. For the father you are. For the best friend I have in you. I’m thankful that I can do absolutely nothing with you and it feels like everything. I hope you know today and everyday how loved you are by me and so many. Happy birthday TT! Welcome to 30! I can’t wait for all of the memories. This is when life just starts getting good!”\nTristan was spotted entering a bedroom with three women at a party, and a source told Daily Mail that “Tristan took off into one of the party rooms where everyone goes to hook up” with the trio and another man. “They stayed in the room behind closed doors for at least 30 minutes. When he arrived, his shirt looked all pressed and when he came out his shirt was a mess, he looked disheveled.”\n A source spoke to E!, who said, “They had been working through the cheating rumors for the last couple of weeks, but Khloé told Tristan he lost all of her trust and the relationship could not be repaired. Khloé really tried, but ultimately, felt too betrayed by him. She's done and says she will not go back.”\nThey added, “They have been co-parenting and have seen each other several times in the last week with True, but are not romantically together.”\nThey continued to co-parent, with a source saying, “Khloé is doing okay. True will always be her first priority, and, ultimately, she's focused on a healthy family for her daughter, so Tristan will always be a part of Khloé's life.”\nThey added, “She's not one to dwell on the past—she has an incredible capacity to find the positive in every situation. And she and Tristan are still very much in touch and are great co-parents to True.”\nInTouch reported that they have reconciled once more, but Khloé denied it.\nThe Mirror shared  InTouch's report and a Twitter user retweeted the story, writing at Khloé, “At this point @khloekardashian has no self worth. Anyway...”\nShe responded, “You’re telling me you made an assessment about my life because of a random blog? I think that says more about you than it does about me.”\nYou’re telling me you made an assessment about my life because of a random blog? I think that says more about you than it does about me.\nAt some point in the following months, the couple seemingly reconciled again, but kept it very private considering their past. However, news came out that Tristan fathered a child with personal trainer Maralee Nichols, who was suing the basketball player for child support and other pregnancy-related fees.\nNichols alleged in court documents, according to People, that the baby was conceived in March of that year when Tristan and Khoé were still together.\nTristan confirmed in an Instagram Story that he was the father of Nichols' baby, and then publicly apologized to Khloé.\nHe wrote:\nKhloé and Tristan reveal they are expecting a second child together via surrogate, a rep told E! and People. \nThe rep said, “We can confirm True will have a sibling who was conceived in November. Khloé is incredibly grateful to the extraordinary surrogate for such a beautiful blessing. We’d like to ask for kindness and privacy so that Khloé can focus on her family.” \nThe baby was allegedly conceived before the Nichols scandal was revealed to Khloé and the public, likely in November 2021.\nKhloé and Tristan welcomed their second child together via surrogate, People reported, and it's a baby boy. \nBuzzfeed and Entertainment Tonight reported that the pair were secretly engaged when the Nichols news broke. She accepted his proposal in February 2021, a month before he cheated with Nichols. \nKhloé shared photos from her family's famous annual Christmas party, partially revealing her son's face for the first time, but not his name. The Kardashians star was wearing a red satin ballgown made custom by Lebanese designer Nicolas Jebran, with True wearing an outfit in a matching red.\nTristan's mother Andrea Thompson unexpectedly passed away on January 5 after having a heart attack. E! reported that Khloé flew to Toronto to support Tristan right after. “Khloe went with him to comfort and help him navigate what will be a very difficult time,” the source said. “She was incredibly close to his mother.”\nE!'s source explained that broken up or not, Khloé remains committed to supporting her ex and co-parent. “Like Khloé and the Kardashian family always do, they will come together and support their loved ones in their most difficult time of need,” the source said. “Tristan is the father of Khloe's kids, and she and her entire family will always be there for him.”\nKim Kardashian and Kris Jenner join Khloé and Tristan for the funeral on January 14, E! reported.\nKhloé paid tribute to Andrea on her Instagram, writing that she promised to look after Tristan's younger, teen brother Amari, who suffers from epilepsy.\nOn Friday, March 10, Khloé Kardashian celebrated her best friends Malika and Khadijah Haqq’s 40th birthday in Los Angeles. She was joined by sisters Kim and Kylie and their mom Kris Jenner. She was also joined by her ex. Thompson reportedly arrived two hours after the gals, but he was wearing sparkling silver sneakers that matched Khloé's silver minidress.\nHe and Khloé were also seen leaving the event at the same time, around 1 am, though they left through different exits. Khloé exited through the venue's back door, while Thompson left through the front. His appearance at Khloé's best friends' party and in a coordinated ensemble has fans wondering if there's another reconciliation rumor around the corner.\nKhloé later posted a birthday tribute to Thompson on March 13, 2023. She had to disable comments to her disappointment, and a source told Us Weekly on March 14 that the post did not mean they were back together.\nIn the tribute, Kardashian wrote, “Happy birthday @realtristan13. You are truly the best father, brother & uncle. Your love, attention, silly dances, hugs, carpool rides, bed time rituals, the way u show up for them. All of the above means more than you’ll ever know to your family of littles. My birthday wish for u is that u continue to crave change, healing, and transformation. Be strong, be kind, be patient, be free. Continue to Make your soul and your mommy proud. Happy birthday baby daddy.”\nA second source told the outlet a day later that Thompson would like to be with Kardashian again though. “Tristan is always trying to get Khloé back, he still loves her and wants to make it work between them,” the source said. “They’re friends and great coparents, but he wants more.” The source did not address Khloé's feelings about this.\nIn the June 8 episode of The Kardashians, Kardashian revealed some more details about how she and Thompson are handling their co-parenting duties in a conversation with Kris Jenner, saying boundaries are key.\n“Tristan and I, we always get along great,” she said. “Him and I have a great friendship relationship, we get along fine, and for my kids, I will put anything to the side.” \nShe continued, “What's done is done, so what would I still be holding on to something for? I don't need to ‘punish’ him because I'm not getting back with him.”\nJenner agrees that they seem to have figured out a system as co-parents. \n“When I'm not around, he's here,” Kardashian agreed. “I would rather him be here than the nanny.” \nShe continued, “There's still boundaries, I'm definitely putting my foot down around a lot of things. No one's just here chilling if there's no kids involved.”\nIn a later confessional, she explained more about why that was necessary. \n“These boundaries are so important to put into place with Tristan because we've done this song and dance a handful of times already,” she said. “I've gotten back with him after a cheating scandal, so I don't know if Tristan is under the impression, ‘Oh wow, OK, let's just ride this out and eventually she'll get back with me.’”\nShe added, “I get why he would think that, so it's my job to set boundaries that my actions show otherwise... it's always about the kids, and that's what it is. But we're not just hanging out by ourselves... I keep it very short and sweet and make sure he knows it's always about the kids because it's so easy to fall back. I can't let those old habits easily come into my life. It's just not what I want.”\nOn the Thursday, October 5, episode of The Kardashians, Khloé and Kim discussed the former's ongoing support of her ex and his younger brother Amari following the passing of his mother Andrea. In particular, why the two brothers are still living with her while Thompson's home is being renovated. \n“I definitely feel overwhelmed and I guess stressed at times, but I'm not the one going through most of the pain here,” Khloé said in a confessional.\nKim's perspective was complicated.\n“I know you guys are gonna hate me for this, and you're gonna hate us, and you're gonna think Khloé's whatever,” she said. “It's so crazy because he's such a good friend and he's such a good dad, but he just couldn’t get it together in that area of being a faithful boyfriend.”\nShe continued, “You want to obviously hate him for that. Yeah, of course, his actions and who he was are so f---ed up, I can't deny that, and we've had our talks about it and had our fights about it... but he’s also shown so many decent things and has been a really good person and friend.”\nShe also said the NBA player is supportive of her kids, too, who she shares with former husband Kanye West. Kim claims that Thompson has stepped into a fatherly role with them and defended her when her ex-husband was being publicly combative. \nLater on, Khloé got more specific about why she lets him stay.\n“I'm not naïve to fact that my ex-boyfriend is living in my house and that we're in really sensitive times,” she said. “Tristan is in the very fresh stages of grieving [his mom]...”I never want to be someone that anyone can accuse that I misled them when it comes to love. I think I'm so adamant about that because I've been on the receiving end of it and I just don’t think love is something you play with.\nShe went on, “Tristan has said before [that] I'm his person. I'm not saying I don’t believe him but I've heard this, and of course, it's angered me before because I'm like, ‘If I f---ing am, then why have you treated me like this and how many times?’ I love love, and I am a hopeless romantic, but that's not gonna change how I feel and what happened.”\nShe added, “We're gonna be in each other's lives for the rest of each other's lives because of our kids, so I'm not gonna fight that, and I'm gonna make sure it's as nice as possible for me.”\nIn another confessional, she called the multiple cheating scandals “traumatic,” but explained how important it is to her to co-parent their children together. She also sympathized with his loss, having lost her own father at a young age. During the episode, Thompson praised Khloé for her “pure and great” soul and she responded in kind.\n“You're a good person at your core, that’s why I was with you,” she said. “Everyone has done dumb s--- in their life, just not everyone does it on a public platform, which sucks ... all of us, we're always rooting for you, we always want the best for you. We believe in you as a person... and just remember, you're not your past.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Rami Malek and Emma Corrin’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-08 15:37:00", "text": "Rami Malek has found love again with Emma Corrin after his years-long relationship with Lucy Boynton came to a quiet end. The two actors made their romance very official when they were photographed kissing on September 21 in London.\nThe PDA display comes after the couple was seen together at the US Open, and a source told People in August that Malek started seeing Corrin, who uses they/them pronouns, earlier in the summer. He “has fun” with them, the insider said.\nHere, a breakdown of their history together.\nMalek, 42, and Corrin, 27, are seen together at a Bruce Springsteen concert in London’s Hyde Park. At this point, his breakup from Lucy Boynton hasn’t been confirmed. \nMalek and Corrin appeared talking close to each other in paparazzi photos from the mid-July concert. Page Six reported that, at one point, Malek rested his hand on Corrin’s knee.\nOn August 4, The Sun reported Malek and Boynton’s breakup. A source said that since the breakup, Malek has been spending time with friends, including Corrin. In fact, he asked them out to the Springsteen concert.\n“Rami and Lucy split earlier this year without much fanfare,” the source said. “They were together for a long time but had grown apart. They are both moving on with their lives and are busy with work. Rami has surrounded himself with his mates and has spent the summer enjoying himself. He asked Emma to join him to watch Bruce at BST last month, and they had a great time. Rami is enjoying life and living it up.”\nThe Sun reported that Malek and Corrin were seen by fans kissing in a restaurant and holding hands on a walk. Photos of them at dinner were published on the outlet, too.\nTheir walk happened earlier in August in North London. A witness told The Sun, “They looked very much like a couple.”\nTheir dinner date was at Buoy and Oyster restaurant in Margate, Kent. An eyewitness there told the outlet that they were quite affectionate.\n“Rami and Emma were very low-key and when fans approached them for pictures, they politely declined,” the source said. “They were very passionate and looking into each other’s eyes. They kissed and didn’t seem to mind who could see. Rami and Emma just seemed totally besotted with each other and paid no attention to anyone else.”\nMalek and Corrin took their romance to New York City. The couple was seen sitting next to each other at the September 8 matches. They did not show PDA in the pics.\nCorrin and Malek made their romance public when paparazzi caught them kissing while they were on a walk in London. An onlooker told Daily Mail that they were “blissfully happy and in love [and] weren’t trying to be discreet or hide their relationship at all.” Corrin wore a tan trench coat, light wash jeans, and a black top. Malek was in an olive sweater, blue baseball cap, and jeans. See photos here. \nThe couple were photographed walking along a beach in Kent on Thursday, September 28, leading Corrin's dog Spencer. Malek leaned over to give his partner a kiss on the cheek, then wrapped an arm around them. Later, they played fetch with the pup.\nBoth were dressed in warm layers, with Malek in a black sweater and a coat over a long white shirt with a collar. He had on baggy jeans, a white baseball cap, and sunglasses. Corrin wore a dark green sweater vest over a lighter green shirt with jeans and a black cross body bag.\nOn Tuesday, October 3, Malek and Corrin made an appearance at the Miu Miu afterparty in Paris during fashion week. They were wearing outfits in black and gray, seemingly coordinated for the night out.

The couple headed to the SuperBlue art installation together, then went out for dinner at Hometown BBQ. In the images, both are dressed casually, with Jenner in a gray tank and white jeans cinched with a thin black leather belt. \nShe left her hair down and wore a pair of narrow black sunglasses. In some photos, her white hair clip is lifting the hem of her shirt, showing a glimpse of torso.

He had on a backwards brown baseball cap. \nOn Thursday, at the BillBoard Latin Music Awards, Bad Bunny received the prestigious Artist of the Year and Tour of the Year awards, as well as Global 200 Latin Song of the Year, Sales Song of the Year for “Tití Me Preguntó,” Top Latin Albums Artist of the Year, Male, Latin Rhythm Artist of the Year, Solo, and Latin Rhythm Song of the Year.\nThe couple have been fairly private about their relationship, but they went “Gucci ad official” in a new campaign last week.

{"title": "Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert Reportedly Filmed a ‘Mean Girls’ Commercial Together", "date": "2023-10-08 14:34:00", "text": "On Friday, a mini-reunion for the classic teen comedy Mean Girls assembled in Los Angeles. The film's stars, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert, were spotted shooting a commercial on a football field dressed in pink, a nod to their characters from the movie. Lohan played Cady Heron in the 2004 film, a naive girl moving to a U.S. high school after growing up in Africa and finding it difficult to navigate a new social hierarchy.\nSeyfried and Chabert were a part of “The Plastics,” the most popular clique in school who accept Cady into the fold, only to find their status quickly disintegrating. Their leader was played by Rachel McAdams as the notorious Regina George, but McAdams did not appear to be on set. \nChabert was photographed in a silver convertible very similar to the one she drove in the original movie, and in another picture Seyfried is talking into a microphone. In Mean Girls, she does the school weather reports. In another photo, Lohan was carrying a bag that reads, “Plastics Club Member,” and the tagline, “On Wednesdays, we wear pink.”\nNext year is the 20th anniversary of the movie and it was recently October 3, a date that has a joking significance in the script and which the cast has often marked on social media since its release. Next year is also when Mean Girls Musical Movie is set to hit theaters, an adaptation of the musical of the movie. The new movie and the original were penned by Tina Fey, and she'll be reprising her role as Ms. Norbury in the adaptation. \nThe gals have been asked about the likelihood they'd make a cameo in the new Mean Girls and in February, Seyfried told Entertainment Tonight that she was “100 percent into” making an appearance.\n“It's been a long legacy for Mean Girls, and I think we all kinda just need to hang,” she said. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Simone Biles Becomes the Most Decorated Gymnast Ever With Another Gold Medal", "date": "2023-10-07 20:57:00", "text": "On Friday, Olympic great Simone Biles broke yet another record with her win at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Belgium. The 26-year-old athlete was awarded her sixth all-around world championship gold, making her the most decorated gymnast ever. She was previously tied with Belarus gymnast Vitaly Scherbo, who competed in the 1990s and took home 33 medals. Biles is now at 34. \nIt was an emotional moment for Biles as she stood on the podium during the U.S. national anthem, alongside silver winner Rebeca Andrade and bronze winner Shilese Jones. Cameras caught her getting a bit misty-eyed while soaking in the accolades.\n“I was emotional because it was my first worlds here, 10 years ago, and then now my sixth one, so it's crazy,” Biles told reporters after the competition. “But I swear, I do have something in my eye that's been bothering me for like four hours and I cannot get it out… So while I was looking up there, it was like a combination of both.”\nWe're not crying, you're crying. 🥹The national anthem plays for 6-time world all-around champion Simone Biles. 🇺🇸🥇 pic.twitter.com/pp0PQ65KSV\nThe champion's success is particularly poignant this year. She only returned to competing this summer after stepping back following the 2020 Olympic Games, which were held in Tokyo in 2021. At the time, Biles was experiencing something gymnasts call the “twisties,” a very dangerous change in perception that makes it extremely difficult to land safely when doing their gravity-defying moves in the air. That year, she withdrew from some events effected by the condition, but won bronze at the balance beam final.\nDuring the world championships, Biles has earned two golds so far, including one during the U.S. team final on Wednesday, and she is still set to compete in the women's vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor routine. She will likely make her return to the Olympics in Paris which are set for 2024. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake’s Full Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-07 19:37:00", "text": "Actress Jessica Biel and pop star Justin Timberlake have been married for ten years and together for almost 16, and they're still going strong. The pair have had their ups and downs, including a brief breakup and even briefer photo scandal. But they recently renewed their vows and share two sons, one of whom was born during COVID-19 lockdown. \nHere's the complete timeline of their relationship thus far.\nShortly after his break up with Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are seen snowboarding together with a group of friends in Park City, Utah, and some might say even flirting. Biel had just broken up with baseball star Derek Jeter. A source told People that Timberlake was only “trying to have a good time.”\nThey added, “He is in no way looking to be in a relationship. He's single and he's happy.”\nAnother source says that Timberlake is “in love” with Biel, adding, “He wants to be with her all the time. He's ready to be serious.”\nOn the cover of British GQ, Biel calls her very private relationship with Timberlake her “one sparkly present” that she doesn't “want to open in front of strangers.”\n“It's the one part of my life that is my own and not for anyone else,” she said at the time.\nRumors start circulating that the couple have broken up, but a source said, “They're together...They're not breaking up. Any time they spend time apart it's because they're working.”\nThey did add, “Things have been a bit up in the air recently. They've been spending more time apart—more time with each of their friends, and they've been reevaluating [their relationship].”\nA few years later, things go from assessing to ending. They decided to end their relationship, but a source stated there were “no hard feelings” and it “was completely mutual, and they both decided it was time to move on.”\nReps confirmed the break up, saying, “Addressing the media speculation regarding Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's relationship, we are confirming that they mutually have decided to part ways. The two remain friends and continue to hold the highest level of love and respect for each other.”\nIn the July issue of Vanity Fair, Timberlake is effusive about his ex.\n“She is the single-handedly most significant person in my life,” he says. “In my 30 years, she is the most special person, okay? I don’t want to say much more, because I have to protect things that are dear to me—for instance, her.”\nThe pair were seen in Toronto enjoying time together at an art deco diner on Queen Street West. An eyewitness said, “They were in good spirits....They seemed happy. They had brunch together. They were talking. They enjoyed their food. They had a nice time.”\nA source explained, “They always remained friendly after the split and spent time together.”\nThe break didn't last too long, though. That November, Biel hinted in an interview with ELLE magazine that they may have reconciled after being asked about her dating life.\n“A girl doesn't kiss and tell,” she said. \nA month later, they were engaged. Timberlake proposed to Biel when they visited Montana, which she recounted years later on The Late Late Show.\n“We were in Montana on a piece of property that we owned at the time,” Biel recalled. “We had snowboarded all day. It was in the middle of the winter. Waist-high snow. We were [in] head-to-toe snowboarding outfits—hats, gloves, everything.”\nBiel continued, “And we go up to the property to just check out how the foundation is looking. And all of a sudden, he gets down onto his knees and just sinks into the snow.” \nIn a cover story for InStyle, Biel says Timberlake picked out the ring himself and often helps her style choices.\n“I had no say whatsoever [in the ring]. I don’t micromanage,” she said. “He is fearless in his choices and has a real eye for design. And I’ll be honest: He has better taste than I do.”\nOn October 19, 2012, the couple marry in southern Italy, and like most of their moments, it's quite private.\n“I had a little bit of butterflies,” Biel told People about the ceremony. “I was about to stand up in front of my friends and family and bare my soul for the person I love. It was terribly emotional.” \nTimberlake confirmed Biel's pregnancy on January 31, which was also his 34th birthday. He shared a pic of himself kissing Biel's belly, captioning it, “Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets.”\nTimberlake celebrates Biel's birthday on Instagram. \nIn April, the birth of their baby was confirmed by the couple's publicist to People. The rep added that “mom and baby are doing well and dad is ‘ecstatic.’”\nThe baby boy was named Silas Randall, and his first photo showed him wearing a Memphis Grizzlies shirt. \nBiel shared something about motherhood with E! News, saying her most magical moment with Silas thus far was “probably the moment he wakes up from a nap. He's sort of looking around and you sort of creep up and look over the crib and he looks up and he goes [big sigh] just a gummy mouth, no teeth, just a big smile, happy that you're alive, and you're just looking at him.”\nShe added, “You quickly move on from it because there is a dirty diaper in your palm.”\nBiel told ELLE.com at the Tiffany Blue Book gala that parenthood changed her style.\n“Some days it does feel as though there's no time for anything. Fashion sometimes feels like it goes to the bottom of the list,” she said. “I do feel like I have to make a little bit more of an effort, because it's very easy to just throw on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and sneakers and just run out the door, because you're doing a million things at once.” \nShe continued, “You have to just say: You know what, I'm going to put on my heels, I'm going to put on my dress, and I'm going to do it. You do have to make an effort, I think.”\nWhen asked about Timberlake's style, she replied, “No, nothing's changed for him, he's fine...He always looks great, even when he's sloppy!”\nJessica Biel's 7th Heaven costar Beverley Mitchell told Access Hollywood Live that she was there when they met and sparks flew.\n“I was there like the moment the love connection happened,” said Mitchell. “I was like, ‘Okay, this is happening.’ They met, it was at the Golden Globes. It was so cute because they were like—it's that moment like I like you, I think you like me. It was very, very sweet. They were definitely flirting. They were really cute.” \nThe actress spoke with ELLE.com at the premiere of her TV series The Sinner, saying her character was informed by her son Silas.\n“It's personal for me,” she said. “I wouldn't be able to do this role if I didn't know what it was like to be a mom. If I wouldn't be able to see my son every day...I get emotional just thinking about it.”\nThat same month, she told Marie Claire, “You think you're a selfless person, and then you realize you're not. These little people come around, and they require so much, and your schedule is really not your own, nor is it important anymore, and it's very clear that it's your life now, revolving around this dude. I'm not that person who feels like, Oh, my whole life changes for my kid, but it does.” \nBiel starred in the video for Timberlake's single “Man of the Woods,” being the babe of the song.\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight Timberlake opened up about needing to go on vocal rest, and how Biel helped him cope with the disappointment of canceling shows.\n“I think anybody out there, you know, you go through anything, to have somebody by your side to really go through it with you and get in the mud with you, so to speak, I'm sure you know what that's like,” he said. “It's like once you find that person, it's like a baptism, where you're like, ‘I can't go back,’ you know what I mean? Like, I don't, I can't go back, so, which is what fatherhood's like too.”\nBiel also spoke to Entertainment Tonight, and shared how she knew that Timberlake was the one. \n“I knew that he was my person early on, but we were so young,” she said. “There wasn't any big risks being taken. There wasn't anything... really putting anything on the line. We were just hanging out. I think before we got married, that's when I was like, ‘Oh yeah, this is the person I want to be in the boat with when we hit the rapids, because we're going to hit the rapids and we're going to have to hold on tight. Can you row? Because I can row, I think you can row, let's try this.’”\nBiel added, “It was like that early on in our relationship and when you're married for the first time you go, ‘Okay. You can't just jump out of this thing.’”\nIn 2019, pics were leaked of Timberlake holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, and Us Weekly reported that Biel pushed him to apologize publicly.\n“Jessica encouraged Justin to put out his statement on Instagram because she felt embarrassed by his actions and wanted him to take accountability,” a source said. “Jessica was very upset and embarrassed by Justin's behavior. [But] they are still united, very much together and strong.”\nWainwright's rep denied anything happened between them, as did he in his statement. He wrote:\nBefore the couple confirmed it, The Daily Mail reported the couple had welcome a second child. \nA few months later, Timberlake's former *NSYNC colleague Lance Bass told Entertainment Tonight,  “The baby is cute of course; it's Justin and Jessica!”\nWhile he spilled those beans, he did not reveal the baby's name, adding, “Justin would kill me!”\nTimberlake's friend and collaborator, Brian McKnight also confirmed the child's existence in an interview with Hollywood Life.\n“Having kids and having his family, I think [Justin] took some time to focus on those things because those things are very important,” he said. “I think if he’s going to do music, he’s going to make sure that that's secure, and then he'll bring us into his music. And being inspired! He just had a new baby. I think that's going to be really inspiring for him and he'll have some new music based on that, I'm sure.”\nTimberlake confirmed he had a new baby himself while speaking to Ellen DeGeneres on her former talk show, a son named Phineas.\n“He's awesome and so cute. Nobody's sleeping,” Timberlake said. “But we're thrilled. We're thrilled and couldn't be happier. Very grateful.” \nIn June, Biel went on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast, and talked about having a baby during lockdown. \n“I had, like, a secret COVID baby,” she explained. “It wasn't like it was supposed to be a secret. It was just COVID happened, and then I went to Montana with my family and never left.”\nWith the pandemic, the couple spent more and more time in Montana and ended up listing their home in the Hollywood Hills home for $35 million.\n“They're rarely in L.A. and are happy to live in Montana,” a source told People. “They also still have a place on the East Coast.”\nTimberlake posted on Instagram for Biel's 40th birthday, and wrote on his Story, “Whether it's laid up on a couch, kicking my ass at the gym or, dressing up at ridiculous costume parties... you make it all look good. I love you and I celebrate you every day.”\nBiel revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that her husband threw her a huge birthday party for the milestone birthday and covered a bunch of her favorite songs.\n“He's just my favorite....He threw me such an amazing, amazing party. And he flew his band in and he performed for me,” she gushed. “Look, I will go head-to-head with everybody, but I'm his No. 1 fan. And I mean, who do I want to see on my birthday? It's him and his band. He's my favorite.”\nShe added, “Everything from Feist to Radio Head to Donny Hathaway ... it just goes on and on.”\nDuring the premiere of her Hulu series Candy, Biel told Entertainment Tonight why her relationship with Timberlake is going strong ten years later.\n“It's a really good question, right?” she said. “Well, I'll have to give Justin the credit in this moment, for this one thing that he always says to me: ‘We might be married, but we have to keep dating,’ and it's so true. You just have to keep making time for each other and you have to keep making each other a priority. And do the things that you love together.”\n“It's not always easy, as we all know, but those touch point moments make all the hard times palatable,” she added.\nTimberlake even made a cameo in the series as Deputy Steve Deffibaugh, a part he volunteered for after reading the show's script.\n“He said, ‘Oh, who's playing this character?’ I said, ‘Oh, I don't know, probably somebody local. We don't have any money left,’” Biel said. “And he goes, “I want to play it.’”\nThe official anniversary of ten years of marriage was that October, and Timberlake posted,  “10 years ain't enough! You make me a better husband and father every day! I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!”\nBiel shared a carousel of images as well, writing, “Being married to you is the adventure of a lifetime! Run it back, baby. RUN IT BACK. I love you.”\nBiel's post revealed that the couple had a vow renewal ceremony when she reshared it in a Story, writing, “From our wedding vow renewal this summer—in Italy where it all went down.”\nShe went on Today and described the ceremony as “very intimate” with just a “couple of friends.”\n“We almost canceled it,” Biel said. “We thought, ‘This is silly, are we going to feel goofy doing this?’ And actually, it was so moving. I felt like, ‘Wow, we're going to keep doing this. Look at us!’ It felt really nice.”\nShe added  of her marriage, “It feels so, I don't know, a combination of incredibly safe and just deep understanding of another person.”\nBiel celebrated Timberlake's 42nd birthday, writing, “Happy birthday to the person who challenges and inspires me every day. The person who keeps me laughing and creating and risking it all. The person who makes the ordinary extraordinary. You know who you are. I love you.”\nTimberlake fêted Biel's 41st birthday with his own Instagram tribute to her, featuring a carousel of couple pics. “Let me tell y’all about this human… she is the most badass, most graceful, most gorgeous DREAM of a partner I could have ever wished for,” he wrote in his caption. “And today is her bday! I’m so glad you were born, my love. And, I’m so lucky that you are choosing to do this thing called life with me. Aging like a FINE🍷!!!! I love you to the moon and back. —Huz.”\nLater that month, on Thursday, March 23, the pair were at the final night of SZA's SOS Tour in Los Angeles. On his Instagram Stores, Timberlake shared a photo of their tickets to the concert at The Kia Forum, with the words “Date night” over it, even tagging SZA herself. There were also some video shots of them dancing and enjoying themselves during the show.\nIn October, photos came out of Biel and Timberlake on a vacation in Italy, the country where they were married and where they celebrated their 10-year vow renewal ceremony last year. The couple were seen with sons Silas, 8, and Phineas, 3, in Venice and Rome exploring the city’s catacombs and going shopping. In several pics, they're holding hands or embracing sweetly.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Sofia Vergara Is 'Doing Great' After Split From Joe Manganiello", "date": "2023-10-07 19:34:00", "text": "On Friday, Sofia Vergara's good friend Julie Bowen spoke with People while attending the Step Up Inspiration Awards and was asked about her Modern Family co-star of 11 years. Bowen said that she will “always” support her friend, and that she has been seeing Vergara thrive after her breakup with Joe Manganiello.\n“Her Instagram says it all,” Bowen claimed. “We have spoken, and she's doing great. Sofia has always had such a wonderful family that surrounds her and wonderful friends,” before adding jokingly, “She doesn't need Taylor Swift to take her to a game.” \nBowen added, “She's good. But I'm super happy that all those other girls are going to games with T Swifty. I wish she had been around for me.”\nShe shared more about their longstanding working relationship and the close friendship that developed over their many years together on the hugely popular ABC sitcom.\n“Sofia has always been my role model as far as embracing being a woman and womanly, and yet also being powerful and not,” said Bowen. “I always felt like you had to compromise one for the other.” \nThe actress has been asked about her friend quite a bit. In August, she told E! News that Vergara does everything “with grace.”\n“And she rises above and she just goes forward. She's warm and generous and giving to everybody around her,” Bowen continued. “I have no doubt that if she wishes to be in a relationship she will be, but she sure don't need one.”\nVergara and Manganiello were married for seven years, and split shortly before her 51st birthday, which she celebrated with friends in Italy and without her husband or wedding ring. Manganiello was the one who officially filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\nIn a statement to Page Six, the former couple said, “We have made the difficult decision to divorce. As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect for our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.” \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Rihanna Wears Tie-Front Top With Denim Ensemble on Date With A$AP Rocky", "date": "2023-10-07 17:35:00", "text": "On Friday, Rihanna stepped out with boyfriend A$AP Rocky in New York City. The couple were spotted leaving a hotel together in their early fall looks. The Fenty Beauty founder was wearing a tie-front top that offered a glimpse of her torso and a peek at her lacy black bra where the shirt's low neckline was unbuttoned. Over it, she wore a denim jacket with the shirt's cuffs hanging out and wide-legged jeans in the same wash. \nOn her feet were a pair of black heels, and she accessorized with earrings, some chains around her neck, and black sunglasses. Rihanna's hair hung in slight waves around her, and she flashed a red manicure.\nThe rapper also wore a matching jacket and slacks, both in a loose summer cut in a beige shade. Under the jacket he wore a white tee, and over one shoulder A$AP carried a woven green leather purse. He also had on sunglasses, a chain necklace and wore black boots. \nThe parents welcomed their first son, RZA Athelston Mayers, in May of 2022. Their second child came just a few months ago, another son who they reportedly named Riot. \nAfter her first child was born, Rihanna told British Vogue that the experience “was beautiful” and that she felt “blessed,” but it was still a huge transition. \n“Essentially, from one person I became two,” she said. “You walk into the hospital as a couple and leave as a family of three. It’s nuts.”\nShe added that “you don't sleep. At all. Not even if you wanted to.”\n“We came home, cold turkey, had no one,” the ANTI singer went on. “It was just us as parents and our baby. Man, you're a zombie for the most part.”\nWhen asked about her notably excellent maternity style, Rihanna said it was much harder to figure out how to dress postpartum.\n“Dressing for pregnancy was such a piece of cake,” she said. “But dressing in postpartum, what the f-ck do you do? The week that I came home from the hospital—that was nothing but sweats and hoodies.”\nShe continued, “You kind of just gotta wait it out otherwise you end up buying so many clothes you’re not going to use. Well, unless you get pregnant again.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Julia Fox States Kanye West ‘Weaponized’ Her Against the Kardashians When They Dated", "date": "2023-10-07 16:18:00", "text": "With the imminent release of her memoir, Down the Drain, Julia Fox has been sharing more details of her personal life that have caused a lot of conjecture before, particularly about her relationship with Kanye West. In an interview on Friday with The Los Angeles Times, Fox shared that when she and the rapper were linked in 2022, she felt he “weaponized” her against his former wife, Kim Kardashian. \n“I thought ultimately I’d be helping a precarious situation, but I learned very quickly that I was being weaponized,” she claimed.\nShe added that she “really understood” West “on a visceral level” and thought their connection “could be something real,” but he did not treat her as she expected to be treated.\nFox stated, “I just felt like his little puppet.”\nThe memoir will share some more details on the time she spent with West, though she says she “went lightly” on him. However, she never signed a non-disclosure agreement.\n“I’m not signing a f-cking NDA just on principle,” she said. “I never have, and I never will... Unless it’s a professional opportunity, then sure.”\nWest and Fox only dated briefly, but she still said she believes that the relationship interfered with certain opportunities. The rapper was himself dropped from a number of brand deals following his very public anti-Semitic comments.\n“I know for a fact I’ve been up for certain things and couldn’t do it because of dating Kanye. It’s kind of wild,” she said. “It really wasn’t that big of a deal, but other people made it such a big deal.”\nAfter they broke it off, Fox said she stopped dating for a while. She focused on her two-year-old son Valentino, who she shares with ex-husband Peter Artemiev.\n“That romanticized idea of men doesn’t exist anymore,” she said. “All the validation I could ever get, I get from my son—the love, the intimacy, the closeness. We co-sleep at night. I have all of that. I wouldn’t want anyone to come in and take my attention or time away from my son.” \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

The Kansas City Chiefs player came out for an interview at the team's practice facility, sharing how it feels to be at the center of so much speculation.\n“As all the attention comes it feels like, you know, I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl and right now even more on top of the world,” he told reporters. “It's fun.”\nSwift has attended two games to see her rumored love interest, one at Arrowhead Stadium and another last weekend at MetLife Stadium, where the Chiefs faced off against the New York Jets. At the October 1 game, she brought friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sabrina Carpenter, Sophie Turner, and Hugh Jackman, adding to the spectacle. These appearances have sparked even more intense interest in the potential couple.\n“We're learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place, but at the same time it comes with it,” Kelce continued. “You got a lot of people that care about Taylor and for good reason.”\nVideo of everything Travis Kelce said today about Taylor Swift, Pfizer backlash, his b-day and focusing on football:\"I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl, and now even more so.\"\"You've got a lot of people that care about Taylor, for good reason.\" #ChiefsKingdom @KCTV5 pic.twitter.com/qIRzyAleAd\nHe added, “Just gotta keep living and learning and enjoying the moments. At the end of the day, I've always been pretty good about compartmentalizing and being able to stay focused in this building. So I'll just keep rolling with that.”\nSome NFL fans have expressed annoyance on social media about the Swift mania, suggesting it's a distraction from the game. However, Kelce said he is only interested in the opinion of his teammates, and they are supposedly enjoying the attention as well. \n“Everybody's having fun with it, you know? Whether I think they're overdoing it or not, I know I brought this to myself,” he said. “I've been fortunate enough to have with it.

The former couple had a prenup, according to TMZ, and there will be no spousal support. \nA source told Page Six, “Ariana and Dalton really wanted to take care of each through all of this and make it as easy on one another as possible—which is why they really took their time with everything.”\nThe insider added, “They have a strong mutual respect for eachother.”\nGomez is reportedly receiving $1,250,000, tax-free, as well as half of the net proceeds from the sale of their home in Los Angeles. Grande is also obligated to pay up to $25,000 of her ex-husband's attorney fees. He is also entitled to continued 24-hour security.

{"title": "Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper Were Photographed Getting Dinner Together", "date": "2023-10-06 21:09:00", "text": "Gigi Hadid’s one-year “situationship” with Leonardo DiCaprio has come to an end, but the model may have another relationship with an A-lister brewing. The Daily Mail ran photos of Hadid, 28, leaving dinner with Bradley Cooper, 48, at New York City’s Via Carota yesterday, which you can see here.\nThe two stars left in the same car after their meal. Hadid wore a low-rise miniskirt with a white crop top and leather jacket. Cooper, meanwhile, was seen in an open flannel shirt, blue T-shirt, and jeans. It is unclear whether they were on a date or just having a friendly dinner. Both are single at the moment.\nHadid was also romantically linked to 27-year-old music producer Cole Bennett last month. \nUs Weekly confirmed that Hadid and DiCaprio’s romantic relationship had ended in mid-September. While DiCaprio “really saw himself dating” Hadid, the feeling wasn’t mutual.\nA source explained that lifestyle differences were a factor in their split, and that it was more Hadid’s choice to end their fling than DiCaprio’s. \nThe two stars “both travel a lot by nature of their jobs,” the source said. “But Gigi is taking more work that allows her to spend more time with her child [3-year-old Khai]. And Leo still travels a lot and likes to go out a lot. And there’s temptation and all those factors had been concerns of hers.” \n“She doesn’t want her boyfriend to be in and out going to clubs and events and working all the time,” the source continued. “She wants someone to be hands-on and a partner. [She] doesn’t want to date someone seriously unless she can introduce them to her child.” She and DiCaprio remain friends, the source said.\nAs for Cooper, he last made headlines for his relationship with Irina Shayk, his ex and mother of his daughter Lea de Seine. For a moment there was a rumored possibility of them rekindling their romance. \nBut a Page Six source dismissed the theory Cooper was bothered by Shayk dating Tom Brady in mid-September. “[Shayk and Cooper] haven’t been together in so long,” the source said. “They are co-parents and that’s that. They are best friends. They are happy. Brad really likes Tom, and there is nothing but support.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "The Bizarre Americana Style of <i>Love Is Blind</i>’s JP", "date": "2023-10-06 21:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nHe’s a walking red (white and blue) flag.\nOf the three couples who made it out of the pods in season 5 of Love Is Blind, only two of them survived the fateful Mexico trip, where the new fiancés are meant to get to know each other physically after weeks of only talking from behind a wall. The couple that didn’t survive—Jared Pierce (JP), a firefighter, and Taylor Rue, a teacher—burned out in such spectacular fashion that it makes you wonder what they even saw in each other in the first place. After an awkward reveal, during which JP looked like he had never interacted with a human woman in his entire life, things only became progressively more uncomfortable, until finally he admitted that he was finding it difficult to communicate with Taylor because he didn’t like the makeup she wore at the reveal. (Huh?)\nYet throughout each increasingly excruciating scene—from their first pod meeting in episode 1 to their final goodbye in episode 6—JP reveals a personal style quirk far more sinister than heavy makeup: the man is obsessed with American flags. This includes but is not limited to: American flag socks, T-shirts, button-downs, basketball jerseys, bathing suits, sneakers, and—our personal favorite—an American flag handkerchief that he snots all over and then proceeds to politely fold and gingerly place atop the couch pillow, as if he didn’t just blow his nose into it. \nJP’s obsession with the American flag isn’t just an affectation played up for the show. According to his Instagram, his love of America is not just a style choice, it’s a lifestyle. Here he is at the beach with red and white stripes down his back, wearing American flag swim trunks and an America baseball hat. Here he is posing his dog next to a red, white, and blue fire hydrant. Here he is going skiing for the first time in a star-spangled snowsuit. His friends even threw him a “surprise America party” for his 30th birthday. \nLove Is Blind fans across the internet appear to be equally baffled by JP’s style choices, particularly those who aren’t American. “JP seems to wear a lot of flags. He’s either wearing a shirt with stars, stripes, both or it’s red, white and/or blue. It’s in every episode which is odd,” wrote one Redditor. “Granted, I’m not from the U.S., so this could be just a standard styling choice that a lot of people employ to show their patriotism. Is this abnormal? Do people carry flags? What’s going on here? Would love some context from someone local.”\nBut even Americans are confused. “This is weird af, right? I’m an East Coast black male and we don’t really do the star-spangled thing,” another Redditor wrote. “That said, what kind of nutcase owns that much flag stuff? Before anyone says it, I am well aware of the MAGA crazies. I just assume they have other kinds of clothing to cycle through…”\nAmerican flag clothing has a complicated history; for some, donning stars and stripes is the ultimate symbol of pride for one’s country. For others, turning the flag into something to wear can feel disrespectful. Since the middle of the 20th century, the American flag has been worn as both a sign of protest and a sign of national support. In the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, the flag served as an emotional symbol, meant to unify a grieving nation. But after the 2016 election, the American flag has become seemingly inextricable from Donald Trump and his flock of MAGA followers. As The New Yorker put it, “To some, the American flag represents freedom, but the nation’s most enduring symbol is taken on partisan significance.” This partisan affiliation with the flag hasn’t been lost on internet commenters: “Someone needs to find out where [JP] was Jan 6th,” quipped one Redditor. \nWhatever JP intended to communicate with his stars and stripes getups, he’s stayed largely under the radar since his breakup with Taylor aired last week. Taylor, meanwhile, has spoken out about how much his comments about her makeup upset her. “It was hurtful,” she told USA Today. “I was also really confused, because I don't know how you can completely change because of the way someone looks.” This season, it seems the show has finally answered the question its title poses: Love is not, in fact, blind. But it is patriotic.\nJessica Roy is the former Digital Director of ELLE.com. Prior to that, she worked as the News Editor of The Cut.

{"title": "<i>Fair Play</i> Was Always Going to End Like This", "date": "2023-10-06 21:00:00", "text": "“For me, more than being a film about female empowerment, this is really a film about male fragility,” director Chloe Domont tells ELLE.com.\nThis story contains discussions of sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs support, contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673) or visit rainn.org.\nSpoilers below. \nFair Play’s first and final scenes couldn’t feel more different. The former shows two lovers in a state of careless bliss, hooking up and simultaneously getting engaged in the bathroom at someone else’s wedding; the latter has them unraveling in a fierce confrontation, one wielding a blade at the other. But in a way, the film ends the same way it begins: in blood. \nIn the opener, Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) is on her period while her fiancé Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) performs oral sex on her. In the closer, Luke is the one who bleeds as Emily scolds him and slashes his arm with a kitchen knife. Their tense confrontation concludes with her killer last line: “Now wipe the blood off my floor, and get out. I’m done with you now.” \n“It was always going to build to that moment, and it was always going to end there,” writer and director Chloe Domont tells ELLE.com. So, how exactly did we get there?\nLet’s go back to the beginning: Domont wanted her lead couple to get engaged at the start of the film so viewers could see them happy and in love before things went downhill. She wondered, “What’s the most ridiculous way that a couple could get engaged?” Then she realized: “Oh, if they’re covered in blood, basically.” The result is a messy, dysfunctional, yet charmingly awkward sex scene, but the stains on Luke’s face and Emily’s dress are an omen: “What the blood represents is the violence to come, which is telling the audience, ‘Don’t get too comfortable.’”\nThroughout the course of the film, Emily and Luke’s seemingly perfect romance crumbles when she gets promoted over him at their cutthroat hedge fund where, by the way, no one knows they’re dating. Luke is reluctantly congratulatory at first; he wants to be a caring, supportive partner, but his resentment grows as Emily buddies up with the guys at the office and makes big wins for the firm (further proving that she deserved the job and he didn’t), all while still dressing like “a cupcake” at work. \nLuke’s snide remarks turn into slut-shaming and eventually into a full spiral that involves him showing up to work erratic and disheveled, sabotaging Emily’s career during a high-stakes meeting. Grasping any semblance of power or so-called manhood, Luke tries to keep the upper hand on Emily by using physical force: Later that night, he sexually assaults her at their engagement party in a scene that starts consensually but then becomes aggressive as she tries to resist. “That’s the only way for Luke to reclaim the power from Emily in that moment, because he’s physically stronger than her,” Domont says.\nThis is the last straw for Emily. When she confronts Luke at their apartment at the end of the film, she’s feeling a lot of things—pain, anger, and still, love—but decides to hold him accountable for his abuse. She finds him ready to move out and fly to San Francisco the next morning—to start his own firm. Apologizing isn’t on his list of priorities. \n“Unfortunately, the only way to hold Luke accountable in that moment is to use the same physical force that he used against her,” says Domont. So, Emily grabs a knife, and makes him apologize for hurting her—professionally, emotionally, and physically. “You sit here, suddenly acting normal after terrorizing me, after cutting me down day after day, and you think that I’m just gonna let you walk out that door and act like nothing happened?” she says in disbelief. \nShe slices Luke’s arm and brings him to his knees, making him say “I’m nothing.” Here is when Luke finally acknowledges everything he’s done, weeping and begging for Emily’s forgiveness (“I will do anything to make it okay for you,”). But she just orders him to clean up his bloody mess and leave. In the final shot, focused on Dynevor’s face, her knife is heard clattering to the floor off-screen. The credits roll.\n“For me, the ending is really about Emily reclaiming the power that Luke takes away from her when he sexually assaults her,” Domont says. \nShe explains, “Ultimately, I never saw this as an ending of female revenge. While there are definitely elements of female rage from the abuse that he’s put her through, for me, the whole movie really builds up to the moment where he mutters the words, ‘I’m nothing.’ That’s the moment where he finally faces his own inferiority, when he finally faces his own weakness, and his own failures. His inability to face all those things causes so much harm, and so much destruction for both of them over the course of this film. When he finally does embrace that, you see him just release everything in his body, everything that he’s been holding his whole life is just released in this moment of finally just accepting this thing that he’s been running from. For me, more than being a film about female empowerment, this is really a film about male fragility.”\nDomont set out “to make a thriller about power dynamics on the ugliest level,” and she did.\nAs for the “wipe the blood off my floor” closing line, she wanted to give the audience “one final surprise.” And it’s true: Before she utters those words, it’s unclear what Emily will do or say to Luke, thanks to Dynevor’s layered performance. She’s not entirely consumed with rage and it seems possible she’ll lean in to kiss him. \n“We’ve seen her go back to him before, and so I wanted to just tee up the audience to believe, ‘Oh my God, is she going to go back together with him again? Is this going to be a moment where they just both submit to a life of pain and dysfunction?’ As you’re sitting with that, then she undercuts him with the [line], which is, ‘No, I’m actually done with this, and I’m done with you.’ It’s almost like she holds him for the last time, and once she does that for the last time, it’s a light switch. She’s now past it, and she’s out, and that’s it.”\nEven the blocking, with Luke kneeling and Emily hovering above then bending down to him, is telling. “This is a man who refuses to accept this submissive role…but as soon as she forces him into submission, that’s when he’s able to release it all.”\nIt would be too easy to write Luke off as solely pathetic, even if that last scene really makes him seem so, but Domont empathized with the character. Luke makes a compelling antagonist because his toxicity isn’t obvious at first; his misogyny is subtle before it grows more blatant. He’s charming and loves Emily and knows he’s supposed to root for her, but struggles when his own power is tested. He’s the kind of liberal millennial man who was raised on traditional gender roles but learned to shed them as he grew up. But still, when he feels threatened, he reverts to suppressing Emily.\n“The more I leaned into Luke’s pain, I think I just realized that was the more interesting version of the film,” Domont says. “The more that Alden tapped into that pain onscreen, and the more that we saw him struggle with those two things—wanting to support her, but also wanting to get there first—the more that we saw him internalize the duality of those opposing forces, I thought that it’s the more human version of the film, and it’s the more exciting version of the film, because it’s not black and white.”\nEven the fact that Luke goes down on Emily while she’s on her period is supposed to signal to us that he is a progressive guy. “I wanted to show early on that we as the audience are made to believe that this is a man who’s not threatened by a woman, because he’s literally got her blood on his face. How could he be threatened by a woman if he has her blood on his face?” Domont laughs. \nThat period sex scene is also notable for breaking film taboos. Domont wrote it because “it’s not something I had seen before.” She pointedly adds, “I also liked it because I knew that a man would never write this scene, so that was exciting to me, too. I am here to flip the script, and so that just felt like part of that.”\nDynevor agrees. “When you see a film like this, it really pushes you to want to create more and put more female influence out into the world. We as women know these things happen all the time, but why are we not seeing it on our screens?” she told ELLE in our October cover story.  \nWith themes like menstruation, sexism in the workplace, apologizing for one’s success, and the emotional labor of tending to the male ego, Domont expected Fair Play to resonate with women. But it has resonated with men too.    \nAt one screening, she saw “a group of men [aged] 60-plus just huddled in a circle, just talking about their marriages, and talking about their divorces, and talking about the way they were raised. It felt like this film unlocked something that they felt afraid to talk about.” At another screening, a man in his early 80s approached her “just so triggered by the film on so many different levels, and opening up to me about his personal experiences, and some of these dynamics. It’s incredibly gratifying.” \nDomont senses that writing a nuanced story and morally gray characters might have something to do with those reactions. “I think that people really appreciate that they’re not being told, or it’s not on the nose—a lesson about feminism, or a lesson about the way men should be. It’s not telling you anything, it’s just allowing you to experience something, and at the same time, enjoy it. Ultimately, I made a film that I wanted to be entertaining.”  \nThe director herself has enjoyed films done in a similar tone from European filmmakers like Ruben Östlund, Andrea Arnold, and the Dardenne Brothers. While Fair Play is just her feature debut (she’s previously directed episodes of Billions and Ballers), she aims to create more narratives like these in the future. “I want to continue to explore provocative shades of gray. I want to continue to tell stories that provoke, that ask tough questions, but I also want to continue to take audiences on a ride. I think there was nothing more gratifying than feeling like I had the audience on the edge of their seat for two hours.” She laughs, then continues, “I think there’s nothing more exciting than feeling like I have them by the throat.”\nDumont doesn’t just mean during the movie, but after, too. She’s very eager to see what debates Fair Play ignites, and “what relationships we can break up.” She calls it “the date movie from hell,” as a joke—but also not. “Probably not the first date, but if you’re starting to date someone, go see this movie, then have a conversation after....That can reveal a lot about a person.”\nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

{"title": "ELLE Escapes: Dubrovnik", "date": "2023-10-06 19:37:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDespite a flood of tourists in recent years, Croatian hot spot Dubrovnik is absolutely worth spending your flight miles on. Often called “the Pearl of the Adriatic,” this coastal southern European city has so much to offer—from its imposing, sea-kissed fortress walls and palatial architecture  seen on Game of Thrones to its rich history and award-winning food and wine. In fact, this medieval, cliffside marvel has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site for over four decades, and was beautifully restored in the aftermath of the Croatian War of Independence in the ’90s.\nLike the rest of the country, Dubrovnik is a melting pot of Italian and Balkan cultural influences—yet it still has its own unique identity. I began my 11-day Croatian tour there, followed by a visit to the small island of Korčula and major port city Split. And while I was only in Dubrovnik for two days—a reasonable amount of time to see the city’s main sites—I could have easily stayed there longer, since it was undoubtedly my favorite spot that I visited on my trip. Ahead, your full scoop on what to see, eat, drink and where to stay.\nStradun, or the main street in Dubrovnik, is where you’ll find many key historic monuments, including St. Blaise’s Catholic Church, dedicated to the patron saint of Dubrovnik; Church of St. Ignatius, which houses the city’s oldest bell erected in 1355; and two monasteries also dating back to the 14th century. But, in my opinion, no tour of the Old Town would be complete without a visit to Rector’s Palace. Located in the heart of the city in Luza Square, this Gothic-Renaissance structure was built in the 15th century as the official residence of the city’s rectors—who each served as the leader of the Republic of Dubrovnik for one-month terms. Today, the site houses the city’s Cultural Museum, which features over 10,000 artifacts ranging from furniture to fashion, artwork, coins, and armory from the 14th to 20th centuries. Spend an afternoon browsing the impressive collections and wandering the historic halls, and make sure to stop by the palace’s picturesque courtyard for some seriously stunning photo ops. (FYI, Games of Thrones fans may recognize this museum as the Spice King’s Palace.) While entry to this particular site isn’t free, you can purchase a single ticket for 15 euros or buy a Dubrovnik Pass, which includes access to this museum and a handful of others in area starting at 35 euros for the day.\nAs iconic as it may be, walking the Old Town walls is one of the busiest and most expensive attractions in Dubrovnik. Instead, you can hike up to Mount Srđ for free to enjoy an even more spectacular outlook without all the long lines. (You can also reach the peak by cable car, but a round-trip ride will set you back 27 euros). The head of the trail, called Staza Prema Utvrdi Imperial, is about a 20-minute walk from the main entrance of the Old Town, and once you get started, the hike is moderately challenging. You’ll definitely work up a sweat while climbing the cobblestone switchbacks, but the breathtaking panoramic views at the top make the trek absolutely worth it. Plus, the peak even has a few attractions, including a large fortress, a massive stone cross, the Homeland War Museum, and a dreamy restaurant. Word to the wise: Leave at least three hours for the journey so you can make it all the way to the top, spend some time there, and leisurely walk back down to the City Gates.\nIf you’re looking to escape the crowds of the Old Town, I highly recommend visiting the Elaphitis for a day. This cluster of 14 islands is situated just northwest of Dubrovnik, with the three largest islets—Koločep, Lopud, and Šipan—currently being the only permanently inhabited. I signed up for a snorkel tour embarking from the Old Town harbor for about 60 euros, which began by stopping at Croatia’s famous blue and green sea caves off the remote islands of Biševo and Ravnik. During certain times of day, sunlight will creep through the cave walls and bounce off the white seabeds, giving the water an enchanting, iridescent effect. Finally, we enjoyed a few hours at Lopud’s beautiful Sunj Beach, one of the most beloved and only sandy beaches on the Elaphiti Islands. While I chose to relax shoreside and splash in the shallow waters during my time there, you can also hike up to the town to explore an old ruined fortress and Franciscan monastery. Alternatively, sommeliers and foodies may prefer to venture to Šipan, known for its verdant vineyards and olive groves. Or, if you’re seeking the ultimate tranquil getaway, consider heading to Koločep, the smallest, lushest, and most serene of the three islands.\nPair with Mason Bottom.\nHotel restaurants can get a bad rap for having lackluster menus and sub-par atmospheres, but Restaurant Pjerin—located inside the gorgeous Villa Dubrovnik hotel—is certainly an exception. This Michelin-recommended eatery offers exquisite Mediterranean dishes and is the epitome of “quiet luxury,” featuring soft, minimalist, neutral décor set against absolutely mesmerizing views of the turquoise-tinged Adriatic. I went for a stunning sunset dinner on the restaurant’s spacious terrace and ordered the delicately rolled lobster pasta and chocolate cake with pistachio gelato for dessert. To start, patrons were also treated to a complimentary selection of seasonal breads and  hors d’oeuvres—which included a mouth-watering sea bass tartare, crispy fish balls, and a refreshing green gazpacho made with avocado and black pepper. Each dish was presented so artfully that when my waiter brought out the restaurant’s (also complimentary) tasting of chocolate truffles at the end of my meal, I did, indeed, nearly shed a tear.  \nDubrovnik admittedly isn’t an inexpensive European city to visit, so for anyone seeking quality dining options on a budget, I recommend Wanda. Spearheaded by former Los Angeles restauranteur and Dubrovnik-native Goran Starčić, this quaint joint on Prijeko street serves up an array of simple, affordable, and tasty Mediterranean classics—think icons like squid ink risotto and spaghetti alle vongole, all made with locally-sourced ingredients. (I had the latter and can confirm it was delicious). You can also expect fast service and a relaxing ambiance, complete with a lovely outdoor seating area protected from all the hustle and bustle.\nAsk any local for Dubrovnik restaurant recommendations, and they’ll likely point you to 360. The Michelin-starred restaurant is popular for its five-course tasting menus and gourmet à la carte options delivering fresh spins on traditional Mediterranean and Croatian dishes. With its swanky dining room flanking the harbor, meticulously plated menu, and thoughtful wine pairings, 360 should certainly be on your itinerary. Just note the restaurant is only open for dinner, and it’s wise to make a reservation, as this place books up quickly.\nTourists flock to this bar built into the cliffs not only to enjoy a refreshing libation, but also namely to watch brave souls jump into the sea below. Head downstairs to the base of the establishment to take in all the action, or if you’re feeling adventurous, join the lineup. You can jump off the cliff from different points, anywhere from about 15 feet to 60 feet above, depending on your comfort level. Keep in mind the bar is cash only and doesn’t serve cocktails, only bottled beer. Oh, and it’s probably not the best idea to drink and jump!\nAnother dazzling watering hole, Cave Bar More is located on the Lapad peninsula just two miles away from the bustling Old Town. It’s set within a natural cave beneath the Hotel More, extending three levels and opening up to an idyllic outdoor patio on the cliffs. (This bar can also be rented for private events like wedding parties and proposals, so you can expect the vibes to be top-notch). Naturally, the cocktails are Insta-worthy as well.\nAlthough Croatia is quickly becoming a force in the wine world (Croatian wines earned over a dozen metals at the 2022 Decanter World Awards, the most prestigious wine competition in the global industry), few Croatian wines are exported. To sample some of the country’s finest while you’re visiting, head to D’vino Wine Bar Dubrovnik. This homey haunt has over 60 wine varietals, including a number from local small wine producers and family vineyards across Croatia’s renowned wine regions like Slavonia, Istria, and Pelješac. Choose from a vast selection of deep reds to dry whites, and consider pairing your vino with one of the bar’s gourmet meat and cheese platters. For a more hands-on experience, D’vino also hosts educational wine tastings Wednesdays through Sundays starting at 210 kn per person (or about $30 a pop).\n\nNestled on a quiet street just a few steps away from the Pile Gate, the St. Joseph’s boutique hotel is about as charming as it gets. The 16th-century building contains just six rooms, which have all been elegantly renovated while still retaining some of the original stonework. I began my stay in the cozy attic room and moved to the Deluxe King Suite during my second night. Aside from the Deluxe Apartment (an adjacent cottage that was once a family home in the 13th century), this is the largest space you can stay in—complete with a sizable lounging area, a dining table, kitchenette, and luxe marbled bathroom with his and her sinks. And if the sophisticated digs weren’t enough, the delightful staff treats you like absolute royalty. Every morning, guests can take advantage of a complimentary breakfast of local sweets, savory dishes, and a signature green smoothie prepared by the in-house chef. And when you stay in the King Suite, you can get the spread delivered to your room (you can best believe I rolled out of bed in the hotel’s plush bathrobe and slippers to grab mine). The concierge also provides superb 24-hour service and will kindly walk you and your luggage to and from the hotel and city entrance, since no cars are allowed to drive within the Old Town. \nMy visit to Restaurant Pjerin left me enraptured by Villa Dubrovnik itself. A scenic 15-minute stroll from the Old Town, this secluded property is a dreamy, airy oasis. There are a total of 56 guest rooms, all of which feature private sea view terraces and some of which even boast their own plunge pools and jacuzzis. Other on-site amenities include an outdoor deck for tanning, an indoor swimming pool, gym, sauna, and even a sun-drenched library for when you just want to curl up with a good book. My takeaway: You could truly relax here all day and not feel guilty about it. \nPart of the Adriatic Luxury Hotels network, Hotel Excelsior is one of the swankiest hotels in Dubrovnik—with a five-star rating and past celebrity guests like Queen Elizabeth II and Elizabeth Taylor to prove it. The 158-room property is set in a former royal villa, now outfitted with modern, custom-made furnishings and a variety of opulent amenities. There’s a fitness center, two restaurants, a spa with Turkish baths and an indoor swimming pool, a private sunbathing area, and more. The entire property is just a five-minute walk from the fortress walls, but if the idea of luxuriating in your bathtub while taking in the Old Town sights tickles your fancy, the Excelsior Signature Suite will be right up your alley. \nKeep your skin protected and looking its best with this dermatologist-crafted sunscreen, featuring added antioxidants and plumping peptides. \nAfter a dip in the Adriatic, I have to make sure my full brows don’t look crazy. A quite swipe of this clear, flexible wax, and you’re good to go. \nFor a streak-free mug come rain, sweat, or shine, don’t forget to pack Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray. You can also spritz a layer of this underneath your foundation for an extra dose of hydration.\nSam Peters is a Senior Commerce Editor at Hearst covering fashion, beauty and lifestyle.

{"title": "All About Bianca Censori, Kanye West’s Wife", "date": "2023-10-06 19:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nLess than one year after Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were declared legally single in March 2022, West has seemingly remarried, and his alleged new wife actually works for his company, Yeezy. \nTMZ reported on January 13 that West and Bianca Censori recently had a private wedding-like ceremony, although they haven’t yet filed a marriage certificate to make it legal. West was seen wearing a gold wedding band while at lunch with Censori in Beverly Hills on Monday, January 9, and the outlet reports he released a song about her, “Censori Overload” last month.\nWest has kept a lower profile since his disturbing antisemitic remarks and Hilter comments generated public outrage and lost him numerous business deals, including his lucrative Adidas Yeezy collection, and his billionaire status in October. Kardashian has not commented on West’s alleged new marriage, and Censori and West have only been sighted together very recently, per TMZ.\nHere, all you need to know about Censori and her connection to West.\nCensori is Australian. Her exact age isn’t public, but The Sun reports she’s believed to be around 28. Her LinkedIn describes her as having finished high school in 2012 and her undergraduate degree in 2017. Her position on the page is listed as head of architecture at Yeezy. She’s been a brunette in the past, but recently went blonde and short in new photos with West.\nCensori earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in architecture at the University of Melbourne. She finished her master’s education in 2020 and received her bachelor’s degree in 2017. She previously was a student architect at DP Toscano Architects from July 2017 to June 2020 prior to starting at Yeezy in November 2020, per her LinkedIn.\nCensori was asked how she got into architecture. “I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia,” she said. “As a child I was consistently drawn to creative endeavors, mostly artistic. I always wanted to be a sculptor and to me, architecture is the union of art and pragmatics. It is the grandest artistic gesture that we can place onto the earth. I was drawn to it, purely, as a shift in artistic scale.”\n“As a child, I spent a lot of time with my aunt who would consistently expose me to an array of art, film, and architecture,” she continued of what fueled her interest in the craft. “She really drove my love for design and instilled in me an eye for aesthetics that I was able to nurture into adulthood.”\nWest’s romance with Censori, at least publicly, is very new. It’s unclear when the two started dating. TMZ reported that Censori and West were seen at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills sharing a meal on Jan. 9, 2023. On January 13, when it reported on their alleged marriage, the outlet added that while West and Censori weren’t seen or photographed together side by side, she had been at “some Kanye-adjacent events, including a Balenciaga show in May.”\nMultiple sources connected to Censori and West told the outlet on January 13 that the couple “recently had a private ceremony to celebrate their love” but didn’t appear to file a marriage certificate yet to make it legal. West was seen wearing a gold ring to symbolize his commitment to her, TMZ reported.\nOn Friday, October 6, it was reported in documents obtained by the Daily Mail that the couple did get a “confidential” marriage license in California on December 20, 2022. Their wedding date was set one month after West's divorce was settled with ex-wife Kim Kardashian. \nThe license was never made public record before because of its “confidential” status, but the marriage took place in Palo Alto, and was officiated by James Mayfield. Censori's full name is on the license as well as West's legal name, which was changed to “Ye” in October 2021. Their marital home is listed as West’s Wyoming ranch. \nDaily Mail noted that what appeared to be Censori’s Instagram account (@bianca.censori) is now unavailable following news of her and West’s alleged marriage. Censori had 16,500 followers and just 27 posts before the handle was seemingly deactivated.\nYesterday evening, West’s ex-wife posted two quotes on her Instagram Story around the time news of the “marriage” came out. “Just remember, the black sheep turns into the goat. Keep doing you,” one read. Another that followed said, “People who want to see you win, will help you win. Remember that.” \nKardashian broke into tears when discussing how hard co-parenting with West had been in an interview released in late December, especially given his hateful public comments. West and Kardashian share four children: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.\n“One day my kids will thank me...for not bashing their dad,” she said at one point. She added later, “I definitely protected him, and I still will in the eyes of my kids. For my kids. So, in my home, my kids don’t know anything that goes on [in] the outside world.”\nA source told Page Six a few days after news of the marriage broke that Kardashian “hates” Censori, and has obviously been aware of her for some time.\n“Kim hates her,” said the insider. “She’s pretty. And Kim hates pretty girls.”\nTMZ pointed out that West released a song with Censori’s name in the track title last month. Its beginning verse, “And The Bible said / I can’t have anymore sex / Till marriage,” may be a hint, the outlet speculated, about West’s sudden decision to get remarried.\nAngelina Censori, Bianca's sister, recently told the Herald Sun, according to the Daily Mail, “It’s very exciting news for both my sister and the family, but we choose to have some privacy for the time being.”\nAlyssia Censori, another relative of Bianca, said that she was “super happy for them both.”\nOn January 22, a new report from The Herald Sun stated that Kanye may be heading to Melbourne to officially meet everyone. A source said that the pair, “will spend time in Ivanhoe, east of the CBD, where Censori grew up.”]\nKardashian wasn't against Censori and West's union, as long as she is positive force to West. The source said, “Bianca has been around their kids. Kim, ultimately, just wants Kanye to be at peace. So if Bianca helps with that, then it’s fine.”\nFans spotted the couple in Tokyo in late June. At one point, West took photos with a fan while Censori was photographed in their vehicle, holding a Hello Kitty doll.\nOn June 11, Censori made headlines for being photographed holding hands with West's oldest child North at his birthday party.\nIn early August, West and Censori were traveling around Italy, and walking barefoot through the ancient cities of Florence and Rome. They even went sans footwear to a Travi Scott concert and while visiting a fabric factory in the Prato East district.\nJason Lee, who formerly worked as West’s head of media and partnerships, told Page Six that he thinks the barefoot look is a PR stunt.\n“I think the fact that people are talking about Kanye’s feet shows just how much power he still has in the wake of cancel culture,” he said. “I think it’s a smart and strategic move. I wouldn’t be surprised if the next time we saw shoes on his feet it would be a project that he designed.”\nCensori drew some outrage from locals for dressing very provocatively, wearing near naked, sheer bodysuits in Italy where her nipples were visible. But after West himself had a wardrobe malfunction where his butt was exposed on a boat, sources spoke to TMZ about how Kardashian felt about their vacation coverage. She isn’t concerned. Kardashian “isn’t staying up to date” on West and his personal life, the sources claimed, noting she is only focused on co-parenting affairs. The sources added that Kardashian viewed West’s NSFW photos vas just an “unfortunate” wardrobe malfunction that paparazzi caught.\nA source additionally spoke to Page Six on September 1 about a false tabloid report that Kardashian wanted to warn Censori about West.\n“She absolutely does not want to talk to her [Censori],” the source said. “Kim is actually a firm believer in letting people be on their own journey and figure out life. She would never call someone and warn them.”\nVenetian Turismo Motoscafi, the company who rented the boat where West's derriere was exposed said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday September 3 that the couple is “no longer be welcome” on their ships.\nThey stated that their employees were “completely unaware” of what was happening at the time, blaming a “third person on board the taxi” who “obstructed the captain’s view”\n“The driver had to keep a lookout for traffic and did not see these obscenities,” the company said. “If this had happened, he would have immediately disembarked and reported the transgressors to those in authority.”\nThey added, “We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behavior. Mr. West and his wife will certainly no longer be welcome on board our company’s boats.” \nIn early September, shortly after their trip to Italy, a source told US Weekly that Censori's friends have grown concerned about how her marriage has swept her away from them.\n“Bianca’s friends are becoming concerned because their friendship with her hasn’t been the same in quite some time,” the source said. “Bianca has always been a strong, independent woman who has her own voice, but they haven’t seen that lately because they don’t speak or see each other as often as they had before she started seeing Kanye.”\nThey added that is Censori is “happy, then they’re happy for her” but they find it “hard to tell... because she’s been isolated from them.”\nThe couple continued their European odyssey in September, heading to Berlin, Germany, where they were photographed waiting in line for a meal at the popular eatery, Mustafa’s Gemüse Kebap. In the photos, Censori is wearing her signature see-through, strapless nude bodysuit over a pair of high-waisted underwear. She was also carrying a backpack and walking in clear heels with pointed toes.\nWest wore black from head-to-toe, with his face shrouded by his extendable collar. They each got a kebab, stopping to eat on a nearby bench.\nCensori's outfits, particularly her see-through body stockings, have drawn a lot of attention as the couple cavorts through Europe. Sources talking to Page Six says that the looks are put together by Laura Beham of the Zurich-based design collective Proto-types per West and his team's instructions.\nThey stated that the rapper has a “whole atelier in Italy.” \n“Anything he wants to make they can make it. He’s really just making it on the spot,” said Mowalola Ogunlesi, the London-based designer who worked with West on his Yeezy Gap collab. “They just buy tights and style it and cut it on [Censori] … Usually they get Wolford. Tights are not safe when they’re around.”\nAn anonymous source confirmed Ogunlesi's statements, saying, “They design it and have an in-house team that creates everything in a day.”  \nSources painted a disturbing picture of West and Censori’s relationship and West’s power over Censori to Daily Mail in early October. One source said, “Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speak and wear what he wants her to wear. She is also required to eat certain food items and to work out even though Kanye doesn’t work out. She has no mind of her own anymore and obeys him because he has convinced her that they are royal.”\nA second source claimed that her friends have been trying and failing to stage an intervention. “[She] is stuck and her friends are trying to save her, but no one can because of the blockades Kayne has put up [around her],” the source said. “Everyone is extremely concerned. This isn’t who she is. She is an incredibly outspoken and lively person who is never one to keep her mouth shut.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

A source told Us Weekly that Meghan is strategizing her next move—and having conversations with both fashion houses and documentary directors. \n“[Prince] Harry and Meghan have been busy with Invictus Games recently, but Meghan is still planning her Hollywood reinvention,” the source said. “Meghan has a new team around her, and they’ve been strategizing about what mediums will have the most impact.”\nMeghan wants her projects “to be rooted in giving back [and] philanthropy,” the source said, adding, “There isn’t anything locked in yet, but the most promising [thing] for everyone seems to be Meghan and Harry highlighting important issues through docuseries and bringing attention and fundraising.”\nHours after Us published its report, a rare new photo of Meghan was posted on Instagram.

{"title": "How to Bleach Your Hair at Home: Featuring Expert Tips from Hair Colorists", "date": "2023-10-06 15:30:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nColorists break down the steps (and precautions) you need to take before you go blonde.  \nSo, you’ve decided to switch up your look and go full-fledged blonde, now what? For one, you could book a professional hair appointment— which honestly might be the most sensible solution. However, if you’re trying to save a few coins or if you simply don’t have time to spend all day in a salon chair, perhaps you've come to the conclusion that bleaching your hair at home is the only option left. \nAlthough you’re probably aware of this, we feel compelled to remind you that there are a few caveats that come along with DIY bleaching. Since bleach is a harsh chemical, you could run the risk of irritating your scalp or damaging your hair strands, so it’s essential to take all the necessary precautions to ensure that you’re prioritizing the health of your hair.\nTo make your at-home bleach journey a bit easier, we’ve consulted a few experts to help you achieve healthy-looking blonde strands. Ahead, you’ll notice a 12-step bleaching process, along with tips and tricks from hair colorist and R+ Co Collective member Richy Kandasamy and Wella Colorcharm and Clairol Professional Top Artist Oliver Adams. We’ve also made sure to feature a number of hair care products that you’ll need in the process, including bleaching kits, shampoos, and leave-in creams. \nLet's go blonde!\nHow does your hair feel? Can it truly handle the damage that you’re about to do to it? Kandasamy recommends beginning with a test. “Conduct an elasticity strand test,” he says. “Spray some water on a piece of hair, and let it absorb—stretch the wet hair very gently. If the wet hair stretches more than usual, or the texture turns a bit gummy, it is not safe to dye, if the hair goes back to its natural state, it’s in good condition to bleach.” He also recommends doing a patch test with a bleach mixture to see how your hair will react using the same method afterward with the small area of processed hair. \n Additionally, it’s important to understand your current hair color situation. If your hair is already processed, if you have used any type of box dye, or if you have virgin, unprocessed hair, these can cause variations in how your hair will lift with the bleach. \nYou’re going to need a few items in your tool kit before you begin. \nWhen beginning to prep your hair Kandasamy recommends sectioning your hair in four parts.  For added protection, rub coconut oil from the root to tip within sectioned hair to hydrate hair. “Using coconut oil before lightening hair can be very beneficial for the condition of the hair,” adds Kandasamy. “You want it to absorb into your hair for at least one hour, even longer if possible and then you can pre-light or bleach.” \nOnce all the necessary materials and prep have been done (and you’ve fully committed to going blonde) you’re ready to make the bleach mixture.\nFor each of the sections that you’ve divided, you’ll follow the below instructions. Kandasamy and Adams both suggest taking small portions within the sections of your hair and saturating the strands to make sure the hair is completely covered. \n“Apply the bleach with 30 volume to mid-length and ends about two inches away from the scalp,” says Kandasamy. “Then, right after, I’d apply the bleach with 20 volume on the roots.” This is the best method to use to avoid hot roots. Adams explains that hot roots are what happens when you apply bleach to the hair (from root to tip) at once and after processing the roots become a much lighter blonde shade compared to the yellow hair of the length. “The hair closest to the scalp processes color quicker than anywhere else on the hair shaft because the natural heat from the body acts as a heater when hair color is applied,” he explains. “This means that when you are doing a virgin application, [treating] hair that hasn't been color-treated, you must apply the color on the roots last, not first.”\nKandasamy also recommends making sure you use enough bleach mixture on your strands.  Once the mixture has been applied, just pop on a shower cap or plastic bag and set your timer.\nOkay, let’s talk hair levels and wait time. “Processing time depends on the manufacturer recommendation and also the natural level of starting point and end result desired,” says Kandasamy.  \nIt might be confusing, but like Kandasamy said, it’s important to understand what hair level (shade) you’re starting with and what color you want to achieve to figure out how long the bleach mixture should stay on your head. This chart from Wella shows exactly what a hair level is.\n“The level system for hair tells you how light or dark your color is going to be, one is the darkest and 10 is the lightest.” Adams explains.  “It’s important to understand that all blondes must be at least level seven or above, so if you are starting at a level one, you have to lift your hair six levels to even begin to see any type of blonde.”\nOnce you figure out your hair level and how light you want it, you can determine the wait time. If you want your hair to lift as light as possible, then leave the mixture on for 35-4o minutes (remember to never exceed 45 minutes). Adams recommends checking your hair to see if it’s lifted to the level you desire and says, “you wouldn’t want to lift hair from one to seven if you only need to lift it to four or five.”\nWhen it’s fully processed, it’s time to wash it out. Use lukewarm water, too hot or cold of water can shock your hair in its already fragile state. Make sure to completely rinse out the bleach and gently wash your hair to get out all the product.\nDon’t freak out! Your hair may look yellow or orange even and that’s okay, it just means you might have to bleach again. Make sure you assess and check the health of your hair using the stretch technique Kandasamy recommended in the first step. Using the hair level chart discussed in Step 6, determine your hair level to see if you need to bleach your hair again. If you do need to bleach again, follow steps three to seven again (your hair needs to be dry). \nMost importantly, make sure to give your hair enough recovery time and consider waiting a couple of days, weeks, or even months before attempting another bleach treatment. You might not achieve your desired results on the first try so it’s important to be patient. Adding excessive amounts of bleach to your hair can lead to something called over-processing, which is when your hair shaft becomes brittle and damaged. Over-processing can also cause breakage and hair loss which is the last thing you want to deal with, so make sure that you’re treating your hair with care.  \nRemember the color wheel from elementary school? This is where that comes into play. Toner will help neutralize any brassiness or yellow hues that will be lingering in your hair after bleaching. \nBefore you can tone, just make sure that your hair is light enough (remember the chart in Step 6). “It is important to understand that if the hair hasn’t been lifted light enough or to the proper level, putting a toner on it is not going to fix the problem and could possibly create a very unpleasant color,” Adams says. So always make sure you are using toner on the correct [hair] level.”\nToner can be applied to slightly damp hair and uses the same 2:1 mixing ratio and application method as the bleach.\nSimilar to the toner, a purple shampoo helps eliminate orange or yellow hues in your hair. Using a non-chemical toner (purple shampoo) is a great way to upkeep your blonde hair to keep it from getting brassy. Use a purple shampoo once or week or whenever your hair starts to get too yellow. \nMy personal favorite is the Matrix Total Results Brass Off, but there are tons of great purple shampoos to choose from.\nAfter all the chemical damage you just did to your hair, it’s important to replenish those strands. “My best advice is to always use a professional haircare product once or twice a week, [like] a hydrating hair mask,” says Kandasamy. Also, according to Adams you should avoid using heat on your hair:“You will want to minimize thermal heat like excessive blow-drying and ceramic heat styling in the 3-4 weeks after bleaching your hair.”\nAt this point you’re blonde! Since this is an at-home hair job, it might look different than what you thought, but embrace that you did it by yourself and rock it with pride! In case you're still nervous or unsure, here's a round-up of YouTube videos that can help you on your blonde journey.\nRichy Kandasamy is a hair colorist and a R+Co Collective Member.\nOliver Adams is a hair colorist and a top artist for both Wella Colorcharm and Clairol Professional.    \nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

{"title": "The Dyson Corrale Straightener Just Went on Sale Before Amazon Big Deal Days", "date": "2023-10-06 15:15:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDyson deals? Groundbreaking.\nIf you’re already planning which marked-down hair tool to invest in for Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, their October Prime Day shopping event, there are so many options to choose from. Lucky for us, some secret sales have already begun, so you can currently shop from a huge selection of top-rated curling irons and blow dryers–not to mention on-sale skin care and a giant list of Amazon beauty deals. \nThe biggest win of all? Dyson quietly put their Corrale Hair Straightener on sale. Right now, you can buy it for 20 percent off, bringing the price down from $499 to $399. At this time, you can take advantage of this fantastic bargain–all with Amazon’s incredibly speedy shipping. Since all of Dyson’s tools are so coveted, there’s no telling how long you have before this straightener sells out–or worse–goes back to being full price.\nIn July’s Prime Day, the Corrale was not the only Dyson tool on sale on Amazon. Their Supersonic Hair Dryer, which recently went on sale on the Dyson site, was also $100 off on Amazon. Along with a slew of other marked down hair tools on Amazon, these viral tools are a fantastic investment to make this October Prime Day. Dyson’s hair tools have never been available–much less discounted–on the mass retailer until now. Here’s to hoping that as we get closer to October 10th and 11th, we see even more Dyson sales emerge.\nThe Corrale Straightener claims to inflict far less heat damage than standard flat irons, thanks to Dyson’s groundbreaking technology. The Corrale also has cordless capabilities, meaning you can use it on the move or traveling, without the need for a plug for up to thirty minutes. “I took my Corrale Straightener to Europe for ten days and forgot the charger. My bangs looked great the entire trip—didn’t even need to worry about a conversion plug and I love the versatile heat settings,” says Danielle James, ELLE’s Digital Beauty Director. While the newly launched Airstrait combines a blow dryer and a flat iron (watch the Dyson Airstrait in action on ELLE Editors), the Corrale can also add waves and curls to the hair.\nSo while you’re checking out the best Prime Big Deal Day beauty deals, make sure Dyson is on your radar. A markdown this extreme is very rare for Dyson, and there’s no telling when the straightener will be discounted again in the future–A.K.A., buy now, budget later.\nTatjana Freund is Hearst's Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor, covering beauty, fashion and more across multiple brands.

{"title": "With <i>Thank You For Coming</i>, Bhumi Pednekar Breaks Free (And Gets It On)", "date": "2023-10-06 13:45:00", "text": "The star of the heartfelt Indian sex comedy understands the film’s intent isn’t to scandalize; it’s to unite. \nBhumi Pednekar knew something was different this time. When the Indian producer Rhea Kapoor first pegged the actress as the potential lead for a new, provocative Hindi-language film, the pandemic was at its peak, an in-person meeting out of the question. But Kapoor insisted they couldn’t discuss the project over the phone; she needed to see Pednekar’s face when the elevator pitch reached her ears. Bemused, Pednekar joined the producer on Zoom, where Kapoor laid out the logline, along with a juicy non-sequitur: “Okay, don’t freak out.”\nThe film she presented that day was Thank You For Coming, about the trials and triumphs of Kanika Kapoor, a 32-year-old Indian woman who’s never once experienced an orgasm—though certainly not for lack of trying. But the sex comedy would cover more ground than its billing might suggest: the complexities of female friendship and betrayal; the long shadow of adolescent slut-shaming; the pressure to pop out babies (and still love sex!); the lure and the pitfalls of marriage in an era where so little seems certain, least of all our own commitments. Pednekar agreed to listen to a narration of the script, and was tearing up by the time it had finished.\n“Look, in my part of the world, a lot of comedies for women aren’t written,” she tells me over the phone as her car zips through Mumbai, a few days ahead of Thank You For Coming’s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Already a well-established, award-winning actress in India, Pednekar’s frequently jumped between genres, from drama to action to comedy, “but it’s never been front-footed comedy, and it’s never been a comedy that’s written by women, a film that’s being produced by a woman.”\nThat, and the subject matter was simply too rich to resist. “Female desire, female sexuality makes people very, very uncomfortable,” she says with relish. “But I love making people uncomfortable. I love making myself uncomfortable.”\nAfter her film debut in 2015 with Dum Laga Ke Haisha (released internationally as, yes, My Big Fat Bride), Pednekar achieved notoriety in films that cast her as rural women, including in action flicks like Sonchiriya, as well as 2019’s biographical drama Saand Ki Aankh, in which she played the real-life elderly sharpshooter Chandro Tomar. (“Suddenly these films were working, and I was bombarded with them–which is when I figured I needed to switch,” she told Grazia India in September.) She wanted to prove she could do something based in her own world: Thank You For Coming offered a departure from her earlier small-town stories, as Kanika would be a Delhi food blogger with a background not entirely unlike Pednekar’s own.\nIn Thank You For Coming—now playing in select theaters—many of Kanika’s hold-ups about sex and marriage stem from the bullying she was subjected to as a teenager. Her gynecologist mother (played in the film by Natasha Rastogi) gave birth to Kanika out of wedlock; she refused to marry Kanika’s father and chose, instead, to raise her as an independent businesswoman and a single parent. Even in Delhi, this choice gave way to the neighbors’ ire. \nDespite her tendency to try on boyfriends like costumes, Kanika can never settle into a relationship that seems to satisfy both parties, literally or figuratively. (Case in point: She loses her virginity in a Lightning McQueen bed.) Instead, she’s unceremoniously dumped on more than one occasion, and stuck drunkenly bickering with her mother and her grandmother, indulging in intergenerational butting-of-heads as the former urges her independence and the latter her stability. Mercifully, it’s Kanika’s girlfriends who are the first to hear when—after one fateful, booze and neon-soaked engagement party—Kanika finally achieves climax. The only issue is, when she wakes the next morning, she isn’t sure whom to thank. Her bumbling betrothed, Jeevan (Pradhuman Singh Mall)? Her ex-boyfriend? Or—shit—that one sweets vendor she was eyeing after a few drinks?\nThe “what happened last night” caper is about as unique a trope as the “awkward-guy-gets-hot-girl” (often, they’re one and the same), but Pednekar’s comedic intuition and uninhibited physicality make Thank You For Coming not only funny, but freeing. There’s remarkably little material in the film designed specifically to scandalize; the message is not one of goading but of guiding. After all, how many of our own wild-night anecdotes have ultimately transformed into poignant wisdom, passed between friends and lovers, mothers and daughters, the once-profane now practically sacred? \nIt’s a tradition Pednekar knows well, having been raised by her single mother after her father died of cancer 12 years ago. “If she didn’t have the female friendships that she has in her life, I think my life would have definitely shaped up a lot different,” she says. “They all were there supporting her, nurturing her through a time that was so, so tough. And because I’ve seen that growing up, for me, my girlfriends are so important. They’ve set the bar so high of all the emotional tick marks that a man needs to [check].”\nOne of those emotional tick marks—for Pednekar herself, as well as for Kanika as a character—is the ability for a man to listen (and accept) when a woman speaks openly about her desire. “Especially in my country, consent, loving yourself, the importance of sex, enjoying sex—it’s not something that is spoken of,” Pednekar says. “If you speak about the want to have sex, or if you discuss your sexual life openly—I mean, they look at you like, Oh my God, you’re a creature from a different part of the world. Because it scares people. Your freedom scares people. And that’s exactly what this film is about.” \nPednekar finds the cultural cognitive dissonance appalling: Not only is there stigma against women as sexual beings, but there’s an equally pervasive pressure for those women to find spouses—before time runs out!—with whom to have lots of sex. “Sadly, there’s so much pressure to just find that perfect man,” Pednekar says. “You do some of the silliest things. You hurt yourself. You hurt people around yourself; you lower your standards. Why the fuck should I lower my standards?” She continues, adding that settling down with a family becomes “like this holy gospel that you have to pray to. And then everything else is secondary, which means your life, your desires, your wants, your ambitions, what you want to do.”\nEven with a project as relatively tame as Thank You For Coming—at least when compared to contemporary rated-R comedies in Hollywood—Pednekar was prepared to deal with naysayers in her home country and abroad. She knew plenty of critics would ignore the film’s elaborate choreographed dance sequences, its pointed jokes about gender politics (“Femi-sanam, femi-sanam, whatever it is, that is what has brainwashed women!”), and its plainly rendered sincerity in favor of its supposed shock value. But when the trailer first dropped in September, Pednekar was surprised by the flood of positive comments from fans, “especially amongst the women, and amongst all my friends from the LGBTQIA-plus communities, and many, many boys,” she says. Then, adding an important caveat: “The ones that are evolved.”\nBut the ultimate impact of Thank You For Coming—especially as it approached its ritzy TIFF premiere—didn’t land with Pednekar until a member of her own staff approached her with some feedback upon the trailer’s debut. This woman, Pednekar says, is “from a small village,” where, “if a boy and a girl are holding hands, it’s a big deal. And she’s like, ‘Yeah, all my sisters and my mother saw it, and they really like your trailer.’” Pedenekar wasn’t sure she believed her. “I was like, ‘Are you sure? They didn’t feel uncomfortable?’” \nThe woman responded with a Hindi phrase that Pednekar translates, roughly, for me in English: “This is the reality of it, right?” In other words: Who cares if Thank You For Coming is uncomfortable? It’s also honest. \n“I was like, shit, we actually underestimate our audiences,” Pednekar says. “Woman to woman, you know what I mean. We might not be from the same social background. We might not be from the same class. We might not have the same education. We’re not from the same geographical location. But you know what I mean.”\nPhotography by Vaishnav Praveen/The House of Pixels, hair by Sanky Evrus, makeup by Sonik Sarwate, and styling by Manisha Melwani and Devanshi Tuli. \nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Zendaya and Tom Holland’s Romantic Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 21:59:00", "text": "Spider-Man: No Way Home co-stars Zendaya and Tom Holland finally confirmed they are in a romantic relationship after years of off and on rumors that they were dating. They've been playing love interests Peter Parker and MJ in the franchise since 2017, but met on set in 2o16. They've obviously been close, but it was in July of 2021 that the paparazzi caught them kissing at a stop light, giving those rumors some more legitimacy. \nThe couple still plays their personal lives very privately, but these are the notable moments in the timeline of their relationship so far. \nHolland was the first to post a photo of Zendaya, but soon they were appearing on one another's Instagram feeds regularly. In July 2016, he shared a pic of them with another friend at the pool, captioned, “Summer Sunday's.”\nZendaya posted their shared Hollywood Reporter cover just a few months later, writing, “Amidst all the chaos and sadness...this one good thing did happen to me today. Honored to share it with the very best...Spider-Man himself.” \nHolland and Zendaya's chemistry onscreen transferred easily to the red carpet, and photos of them being playful with one another at the San Diego Comic-Con were widely circulated by fans.\nIn May 2017, they start attending events together, possibly because of promotional opportunities, but photos taken of them show a more personal relationship, like this photo from the MTV Movie and TV Awards.\nThroughout the month, they're frequently photographed together as they promote Spider-Man, but it seems like the easy chemistry of two familiar colleagues. \nIn July 2017, a source confirms to People magazine that they are together.\n“They started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man,” the source said. “They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye, but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.”\nA second insider added, “They’re both really ambitious, and they challenge each other—but, most importantly, they make each other crack up. They seem to have a really similar sense of humor and love joking around together. They have great banter back and forth.” \nBefore the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere in June, Holland was gushing to People about his friendship with Zendaya, saying, “We are like the best of friends. She’s so great and amazing. I’m a little worried [about dealing with fame … [but] Zendaya is super famous and she’s been through this and I just call her up and say, ‘How do I manage being famous?’ I’m very glad I have a friend like her.”\nThe pair addressed the dating rumors above by tweeting to one another about the idea they've gone on vacation together.\n“Wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on a vacation in years! hbu?” Zenday wrote to Holland.\nHe joked back, “Does the press tour count?”\n@Zendaya Does the press tour count 😂😝 https://t.co/2WsstZPyde\nThe next month, Zendaya denied the rumors again in an interview with Variety.\n“We are friends,” she said. “He’s a great dude. He’s literally one of my best friends. This past how many months we’ve had to do press tours together. There’s very few people that will understand what that’s like at 20 years old.” \nThe next month, Zendaya told fans she'd been cheated on in the past and why it left her a bit skeptical about relationships early in life. The actress is currently 25-years-old, so at the time she was just out of her teen years.\n“I’m so anti being in a committed relationship when you’re young and people are learning and growing, because when people are young, they make bad decisions sometimes because they don’t know any better,” she explained. “It doesn’t mean they don’t know the difference between right and wrong—it just means that they’re still in the experimental phase in their life where they haven’t made the right decisions yet…it’s very hard to be in a relationship when the both of you are still figuring out life. You cannot change anybody. You cannot make someone grow up faster than they’re supposed to.”\nAt this point, Holland has met Zendaya's parents, meeting them at a steakhouse in New York.\nIn March 2018, the two stars sat together at the Oscars, though they walked the carpet separately. They were seen later that month at a comic book store in Los Angeles.\nZendaya attended the Met Gala, wearing a Joan of Arc-inspired chainmail Versace gown, and Holland posted a photo of her to his Instagram writing, “All hail the queen. Killing it mate.”\nThe next month, Zendaya posted a video of Holland goofing off with a lightsaber to wish him a happy birthday. She captioned the video: “Happy birthday loser…” \nIn September, Holland celebrated Zendaya's birthday with a paparazzi photo from their date at the comic book store and a statue of Spider-Man. \n“Me, myself and the birthday girl. Happy birthday mate - keep killing it and paving the way for the rest of us,” he wrote adding a heart. (Seems like he likes calling her “mate” a lot.)\nBut then a few days later, Skai Jackson’s mother said on Instagram that they are, in fact, a couple.\n“Yes. It's true. They been on the low for a while,” she wrote.\nShe then denied she was the commenter using her screen name., “Nothing posted or said was me. I could [sic] care less or know who was dating who. Please stop asking.” Okay then!  \nHolland and Zendaya begin their Spider-Man: Far From Home press tour, and when Holland posts an Instagram of himself, Zendaya, and co-star Jacob Batalon, he accidentally tags her name in a very suggestive place.\n“I'm assuming because you don't know how to work ig, that's the reasoning behind my name placement,” she commented with five laughing emojis.\nHolland  edits the tag and writes, “Thanks @zendaya for making me aware of my obvious blunder.” \nHolland shoots down the Zendaya dating rumors again. The actor tells ELLE in an interview that he is single and not romantically involved with anyone. He admits he is “definitely a relationship person. I’m not the fleeting type at all; it’s not my way of life.”  \nZendaya is seen with her Euphoria costar Jacob Elordi and they  are spotted together on vacation in Greece. Again, Zendaya never confirms she's dating Elordi, but paparazzi did catch Elordi giving her a kiss in New York City in February 2020. By September of that year, Elordi seems to be dating Kaia Gerber (but they broke up in November 2021.)\nTom Holland appears to go Instagram official with his girlfriend Nadia Parkes, who he was supposedly spending lockdown with in London. \nThen, two years after denying they're a couple, the Spider-Man co-stars were spotted together in Holland's car sharing a kiss at a red light in LA. They were then seen in the Silver Lake neighborhood the same day, leaving Zendaya's mother Claire Stoermer's residence. \nHolland and Zendaya are photographed at a friend's wedding for an Instagram story. In the photo, Zendaya is leaning into Holland and he has his hand on her sleeve in an intimate gesture. \n📸 | NEW picture of Tom Holland and Zendaya at a friends wedding tonight most likely in Oakland. Via: estebancamarillo Instagram stories pic.twitter.com/spFCMu4w1v\nTom Holland shares a mirror selfie of himself with Zendaya on the set of Spider-Man, captioning it, “My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays. Gimme a call when your [sic] up xxx.” \nLater that month, Zendaya posts photos of herself on the red carpet for the Venice Film Festival in her Balmain dress, looking stunning. Holland commented with three flame emojis, because she's definitely looking hot hot hot.\nHolland once again posts Zendaya to his timeline, this time with a photo of her on the red carpet for Dune, captioned with a hearts-eye emoji.\nA day later, Zendaya was also promoting Dune, this time with co-star Timothée Chalamet. The pair were testing one another's friendship knowledge for a BuzzFeed video when Chalamet was asked who Zendaya's biggest crush is. \n“Easy, Tom Holland!” Chalamet answers immediately, setting Zendaya off into a fit of giggles.\nIn an interview with GQ, Tom Holland talks to about relationships and the importance of privacy.\n“One of the downsides of our fame is that privacy isn’t really in our control anymore, and a moment that you think is between two people that love each other very much is now a moment that is shared with the entire world,” Holland said. \nZendaya told the outlet something similar, saying, “The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own.…I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.”\nDuring the London photo call for Spider-Man: No Way Home, Holland is  interviewed and points to Zendaya, saying, “There she is—looking beautiful, might I add.”\nOn December 13, the Los Angeles premiere of the film includes this adorable moment when Holland sees Zendaya walk in and gets stopped in his tracks. They do look stunning together on the red carpet, too.\nLater that week, Zendaya posted photos of Holland as Spider-Man at two different ages, writing, “My Spider-Man, I’m so proud of you, some things never change and good thing.”\nZendaya came to meet Holland's family in London, attending with his brothers Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on West End on January 22. The next day, Holland and Zendaya were at Holland's family's house in casual clothing.\nTom Holland and Zendaya seen in New York City as Holland promoted his new film Uncharted, and held hands as they left their hotel together. Matching in dark tones, Zendaya wore a belted gray shirt dress while Holland wore a light gray suit and black top. Both wore black masks amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nLater that month, Holland flew to Rome to surprise Zendaya with a date at Antica Pesa in the city’s Trastevere neighborhood, Page Six reported. Multiple sources told the outlet about the couple’s date, which started at 7 P.M. there and went until 10:30 P.M.\nOne eyewitness said, “She seemed visibly thrilled. They sat in a corner by the fireplace and were adorable together. They looked in love.” Insiders described the two as being “in deep conversation” there.\n“Zendaya looked stunning, even as simply dressed as she was. They are adorable together,” the source said, adding they were later joined by friends. “[They] laughed all night while being cute with each other.”\nThe restaurant shared a photo of Zendaya and Holland with chef Francesco Panella on its Instagram. \n“Thank you @tomholland2013 for coming back again to @anticapesa for your surprise night with @zendaya & friends,” he captioned the shot.\nHolland also traveled to Boston to visit Zendaya as she was shooting the romantic drama The Challengers in the city, Boston.com reported. The couple were seen having a coffee day date together at Tatte on Boylston Street. Zendaya was dressed down in a white top and glasses, and in one shot shared on Instagram, was seen looking adoringly at her partner:\nGreat Day in BostonSaw @Zendaya and @TomHolland1996 casually having a day in the city. Y’all take care and I’ll see you around. pic.twitter.com/OPE0CDehW8\nIn early September, Zendaya celebrated her her 26th birthday in Manhattan with Holland at MAMO Italian restaurant. The actress looked casual and chic in low-waisted denim jeans and a black crop top with long sleeves and a V-neck, which was held together with a few buttons in front. Zendaya dressed the outfit up a bit with suede pumps and a pair of diamond earrings and a pendant. \nHolland arrived at the restaurant in a blue plaid button-down, dark teal pants, and white sneakers. They were joined by several of Zendaya's co-stars, including her Euphoria cast mate Hunter Schafer. Zendaya's mother Claire Stoermer was also in attendance. \nLater in September, Zendaya spoke about Holland when she was interviewed by E! News just after winning an Emmy Award for her performance as Rue on Euphoria. After they asked who she texted first after winning she replied, “Well, I didn't have to text my mom because my mom was already there, she's here tonight, which is very special. And I texted my boyfriend.”\nZendaya and Tom Holland visited the Louvre in Paris, walking hand-in-hand through the famous museum's galleries. They were both dressed casually for their day out, Zendaya wearing a large light blue blouse with her sleeves rolled up, her hair up in a bun with a few curling tendrils around her face. She wore a pair of glasses for the tour, a black bag, and carried a small camera.\nHolland was in a white and black striped shirts with long sleeves and black pants, his short hair tousled. Zendaya was in the city for Paris Fashion Week, which ended on October 4. \nJust before Thanksgiving, a source tells US Magazine that the two Spider-Man stars are getting closer all the time and seem “serious and permanent.”\n“They’re both in settling-down mode and are absolutely planning for a real future together,” the source added.\nAfter taking a break from social media over the summer, fans noted Holland's exploring Instagram again. A fan edit of Zendaya looking fantastic in a million outfits was popular on the algorithm, and it eventually reached her boyfriend. The clip is captioned, “just zendaya owning the camera,” and clearly he agreed because he hit the like button.\nFans noted his “heart” on the images and were thrilled to see he is as in love as ever.\nEarlier that month, they made an appearance on Instagram together after Holland accompanied Zendaya on a visit to her old high school in Oakland. Pictures of the meet-and-greet were shared by her theatre teacher Tavia Percia.\nNeither Zendaya nor Holland attend any award season shows with each other, but during Oscars weekend, the couple is seen in London, where Holland's family is based, and days later together at a grocery store in the city.\nFans noticed later that month that Zendaya was wearing a ring with Holland's initials. They also noted that Holland has been wearing pants with a “Z” initial on the back pocket in sweet sartorial tributes to each other.\nZendaya spotted wearing an engraved gold ring with boyfriend, Tom Holland’s, initials in her manicurist’s Instagram story. pic.twitter.com/Vbw9pMYLNw\nIn May, the couple were visiting Venice together, and photographed getting into a private boat as they left the Gritti Palace hotel. Holland was wearing khaki pants and a white button down with the top button open to reveal a thin gold chain. His girlfriend wore a grey body-hugging knit dress with a thigh slip under a black jacket. On her feet were matching black leather boots, and she was also wearing a gold necklace for the Italian outing. Holland got into the boat ahead of his girlfriend and she navigated it a bit more slowly.\nTom Holland joked about his “rizz” during a BuzzFeed, slang for “charisma,” and why he's glad he already has a girlfriend.\n“I'm happy and in love, so I've got no need for rizz,” he said. “I have no rizz whatsoever; I have limited rizz... I need you to fall in love with me, really, for it to work.”\nHe added, “So, long game. Probably making a movie with each other — it definitely helps when the characters are falling in love with one another; you can sort of blur the lines a little bit.”\nHe also shared that his girlfriend Zendaya was was also his childhood celebrity crush.\n“Zendaya. Easily,” he replied after they asked for names.\nHolland appeared that same month in a cover story for The Hollywood Reporter, and he discussed why the couple keeps their life private. It's partyly because they are “two very busy people.”\n“Our relationship is something that we are incredibly protective of and we want to keep as sacred as possible,” he explained. “We don’t think that we owe it to anyone, it’s our thing, and it has nothing to do with our careers.”\nHe also joked about how his Spider-Man co-star sends him constant content on social media.\n“She sends me too much, it's like, I can't keep up,” Holland said. “I delete my Instagram for days at a time. I download it to post and then I have to check my messages, and I'll have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things from her.”\nOn the July 3 episode of the Wondery podcast Smartless, Holland spoke with hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett about why he and Zendaya work so well.\n“I'm lucky that I have someone like Zendaya in my life,” Holland said. “It's interesting being in a romantic relationship with someone that is in the same boat as you.”\nHe continued, “You can share your experiences and all that sort of stuff — and that's worth its weight in gold.”\nZendaya spoke to ELLE about whether fan liking her and Holland as a couple so much makes it easier to accept the public’s interest in them.  \n“Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public,” she replied. “I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love.

{"title": "All About Dylan Meyer, Kristen Stewart’s Screenwriter Fiancée", "date": "2023-10-05 21:56:00", "text": "As Kristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer’s relationship continues way past the two-year mark, things between them are stronger than ever—to the point where they’re ready to get married. On November 2, 2021, Stewart revealed the two are engaged to Howard Stern, and Meyer popped the question.\n“We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”\nIt’s a decidedly new chapter for Stewart, who opened up in a recent issue of InStyle about being “sort of cagey” in previous relationships. Meyer and Stewart were first romantically linked in summer 2019, but the couple actually met six years before on a movie set, Stewart told Howard Stern last November. They later reconnected at a birthday party for a mutual friend. “The day that I met her, all bets were off,” Stewart remembered. “I was like, ‘Where have I been and how have I not known you?’ She's been, like, living in LA alongside my life somehow but not ever converging?”\nThe actress even told the radio host that she was ready to propose in November 2019, two years before it actually happened. \nIn July 2021, the two even sparked secret marriage rumors when they were photographed wearing rings on their left ring fingers, although they never even announced they were engaged. In September 2021, the two were photographed together again, signaling their relationship remains on and strong.\nAhead, everything we know about Meyer, including her screenwriting career and how she paid tribute to Stewart during her birthday and Valentine's Day in 2023.\nStewart told Stern that she met Meyer on a movie set six years ago. While she didn't specify which one, Meyer has written and co-starred in multiple films and TV shows. She co-wrote and executive produced the 2016 Netflix movie XOXO, starring Sarah Hyland. She penned episodes of the sci-fi series Miss 2059. Meyer also wrote the short films Loose Ends (2015) and Rock Bottom (2019), which you can watch right here:\nAs for her acting credits, Meyer has appeared in short films including The Death and Return of Superman (2011), Wrestling Isn't Wrestling (2015), and Jem Reacts to the New Jem and the Holograms Trailer (2015). \nRumors about Meyer and Stewart's relationship began in August 2019 when the pair was seen kissing on a New York City stoop. The sighting came less than a month after Stewart was photographed kissing on-off girlfriend Stella Maxwell on a yacht in Italy. A source told E! at the time that while \"it will always be very easy for Kristen to fall back with Stella,\" she's focused on her new relationship with Meyer. \n\"Kristen is spending time with Dylan and very happy about it,\" the insider told E! News. \"She was seeing Stella for a little bit while it worked, but now she has moved on with Dylan.\" The source added, \"Kristen isn't holding back at all and loves being with her. They are moving quickly and always together.\"\nStewart confirmed the fast-paced nature of their romance during her November interview with Stern, revealing to him that she told Meyer she loved her two weeks into dating. \"It was like really late, and we were in some shitty bar, and her friends were there or whatever, and they like walked out, and I was just like, 'Oh man, I’m so f*cking in love with you. Done,'\" she recalled. \"It wasn't like a thing, and also it was like so obvious. It just is.\" Stewart later added of their connection,  \"We're both from L.A. and we really love L.A. We're both kind of like, scumbags. We both felt like trolls as kids. We're so similar but different. She's a writer; she's brilliant.\"\nAlthough Stewart herself doesn't have a public Instagram, Meyer shared a first glimpse into the couple's relationship last October. She posted a black-and-white snap of a polaroid where the couple can be seen kissing. \"Find me under the covers hiding from the happiness police. 🖤,\" she captioned the post.\nSix months later, Meyer shared a birthday tribute for Stewart on the 'gram, writing, \"It’s my absolute favorite person's birthday and I’m wishing everyone the volume of beautiful feeling I feel toward her. It's a short ride on this earth, spend your time with someone that inspires you to be the best version of yourself and lights your shit on fire.\"\nWhen Meyer isn't gushing about Stewart, her social media is filled with a ton of nature and animal photos. You'll find pictures of her cats Zsa Zsa and Snack in various scenarios, as well as outdoor shots from around Los Angeles.\nThe couple may keep their romance private, but that doesn't mean things aren't serious between them. During her November 2019 interview with Stern, Stewart got very candid about her feelings toward Meyer. She told Stern that she \"can't f*cking wait\" to propose to Meyer and said she would \"absolutely\" get married. \n\"Yeah, I want to be, like, somewhat reasonable about it, but I think good things happen fast,\" Stewart continued, telling Stern she has a plan for how she'll pop the question. \"I can't say right now, because she'll find out.\" Stewart also said that her matrimony plans weren't \"tied to any weird sort of convention; it's just, like, when you know, you know.\"\nMeyer and Stewart kept a low-profile during stay-at-home orders but made made a rare outing in June 2020 for a coffee run in L.A. The Daily Mail captured photos of the couple wearing casual gray and black outfits, masks, and sunglasses while on their errand.  \nThe outlet also published photos of the couple participating in a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles earlier this month, following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and others at the hands of police. \nSources told  E! in October 2020 that Stewart and Meyer attended an intimate baby shower for Emma Roberts and Garrett Hedlund. (Stewart and Hedlund co-starred together in 2012's On the Road.) They joined the likes of Camilla Morrone (Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend) and Lily Kershaw to celebrate the upcoming arrival of Roberts and Hedlund's son.\nStewart, who next stars in the LGBTQ holiday rom-com Happiest Season, doesn’t have a ’gram. However, she used her girlfriend’s platform to urge people to vote in the upcoming election. “I turned the mic over to Kristen because she had some things to say and doesn’t have her own account. Happy #nationalvoterregistrationday!” Meyer captioned a selfie of Stewart in a “VOTE” tee on September 22. Kristen wrote, via Meyer's account:\nMeyer also shared a black-and-white photo of herself and Stewart to encourage voting. “I think I might chew my fingers off from nerves today but here’s a sweet photo @lindseybyrnes took. I really hope you vote. There are lots of crucial issues on your ballot besides the presidency and your voice truly does make a difference. The opportunity to have a say in the laws that govern you is precious, please don’t waste it,” she captioned the snap.\nOn April 9, Stewart’s 31st birthday, she and Meyer were out grocery shopping (masked). \nShe also posted on Instagram to celebrate her girlfriend’s birthday. \n“Life sure is sweeter with this cute little family,” she wrote. “Happy birthday, kiddo. You knock my socks off.”\nLaineyGossip pointed out that Stewart and Meyer were photographed at LAX in July 2021 wearing rings on their left ring finger. The two never confirmed wedding rumors or that Stewart even proposed to Meyer at this point. Meyer and Stewart, throughout their relationship, have managed to keep most details private and out of the limelight.\nOn November 2, Stewart told Howard Stern that Meyer popped the question.\n“We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”\nDuring her appearance on Stephen Colbert's talk show, Stewart addressed wedding planning—and how they may just elope. “I want to have a big party or something,” she said. “I’m so unceremonial. I think we might just go do it this weekend or something, I don't know, and then, like, just hang out with everyone afterwards,” Stewart said.\nIt isn’t often Stewart and Meyer's private life with friends is documented on social media, but Ashley Benson gave the world a rare glimpse into their dynamic in January 2022. The former Pretty Little Liars actress shared a group shot of Stewart and Meyer alongside each other and friends at Disneyland. “Family trips to Disney @cjromero @spillzdylz @sweetsuzieq @michael,” Benson captioned the shot, tagging Meyer's Instagram.\nStewart is nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars this year, and ahead of the ceremony, Meyer joined Stewart on the events circuit. On March 8, Meyer attended the Oscars nominee luncheon with Stewart and The Hollywood Reporter’s Oscar nominees night. Meyer matched her outfits to Stewart’s for both events, wearing a black Alessandra Rich mini dress for the luncheon and a white tank in the evening.\nThe two then attended the Critics’ Choice Awards together, where Stewart was nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Princess Diana in Spencer. At the show, Stewart wore a nude, glittery Dolce & Gabbana gown with Messika jewelry and Jimmy Choo shoes and Meyer wore a complimentary white August Getty Atelier and Chanel ensemble.\nStewart spoke this month about how blessed she feels having her personal life and career thrive at the same time. “I’m living a simulation, it’s too good,” Stewart told E!. “You run through the list, and I go, like, is that possible? Right now, I’m definitely feeling it. It’s not lost on me any second of any day. I will tell you that.”\nTo top off an eventful awards season, Meyer and Stewart stepped out together at the 2022 Academy Awards, where Stewart is nominated for Best Actress for her role in Spencer. The duo, matching in black and white suits, posed together in the red carpet and engaged in some PDA in front of the cameras. They held hands as photos snapped and shared a quick kiss before Meyer let Stewart pose solo. \nKristen Stewart and at fiancée Dylan Meyers share a kiss on the red carpet at the #Oscars. https://t.co/abMq1BYSsP pic.twitter.com/5FObv4pm1D\nOn Saturday, December 3, the pair were spotted tooling around Los Angeles in their Dodge van like any suburban couple. They were headed to a friend's house and dressed comfortably for the afternoon. Stewart was behind the wheel and smoking a cigarette as she navigated the quiet streets. The Twilight actress was wearing black Adidas sweatpants with white stripes and a black sports bra under a hoodie. She paired the look with white Nike sneakers and sunglasses. After being a blonde for quite a while, Stewart has gone brunette with a short chop. \nMeyer was also dressed casually and in sunglasses. Sunday, December 4, was Meyer's 35th birthday, so there may have been fancier plans ahead for the couple. \nWhile the pair have kept their relationship mostly under the radar, Meyer posted a tribute to Stewart on her Instagram on February 14, 2023. Meyer wrote: “One time I turned a hundred dollars into fourteen hundred dollars at a casino in Pittsburgh. I was playing craps (my first time ever) and when it was my turn at the dice I didn’t roll a seven for forty five minutes straight. Strangers were getting rich off of my hot streak, tipping me chips and tequila shots. Cheering for me, clapping me on the back. Calling their gambling addicted friends/co-workers/ex-wives to regale them with my extraordinary feat. I was the hero of the people, an instant legend. Bennie and the Jets was playing. My hair looked great, too. And even this, the clear peak of my short time on earth, does not remotely come close to how it feels to spend a Monday night in sweatpants with you, valentine.”\nOn April 9, 2023, Meyer took to Instagram to share her love for Stewart again in honor of the actress' birthday. Meyer wrote, “Cheers to my favorite Shrimp on her birthday! Sweetheart, I love you more than all the shades of green, all the phases of the moon, all the cats in LA. Love you more than chunking express, or Denis Johnson’s already dead, or the stooges’ raw power. I love you more than a dominos pizza when you’re stoned, a Ricky’s fish taco when you’re hungover, and EVEN more than a plate of wings ~ hot and extra crispy ~ from rustic, aka the pinnacle of my capacity to love. Some might say that’s too much love but I say those people are squares. Go big or go home! Happy birthday dude I love you so much.”\nMeyer and Stewart continued to keep their relationship mostly private during summer 2023, although paparazzi captured the couple grabbing dinner with friends on August 4, 2023 in Los Angeles.\nMeyer herself last posted a shot of her with Stewart on Instagram in June:\nMeyer and Stewart kept a low profile through September. Paparazzi captured them getting lunch together Little Dom’s in Los Angeles on October 2 though. Both matched in blue looks, with Stewart wearing a light blue cardigan with a white top and light-wash jeans. Meyer was in khaki pants, an open navy blue button-up, and a white top.

{"title": "All About Malcolm McRae, Anya Taylor-Joy’s Husband", "date": "2023-10-05 21:49:00", "text": "Anya Taylor-Joy has kept her personal life as private as she can manage as her Hollywood profile grows. But ahead of The Queen’s Gambit actress’s Saturday Night Live hosting gig in May 2021, Taylor-Joy was photographed making out with musician Malcolm McRae in New York City. The photos sparked dating rumors—and come after Taylor-Joy spoke about having a partner in her ELLE May 2021 interview.\nTaylor-Joy didn’t initially explicitly confirm that she and McRae are dating, but they didn’t exactly hide their romantic connection in the city. According to Page Six, the two were seen holding hands and kissing multiple times while walking around the Big Apple.\nIn September 2021, the two were photographed kissing again, this time in Venice. And in March 2022, Taylor-Joy spoke about her romance with McRae in an interview and made her red carpet debut with him at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party. In July 2022, the two went further, secretly tying the knot, a source told Page Six. The two ultimately made their first award show debut as a couple at the Golden Globes in January 2023.\nIn September 2023, the Daily Mail reported they would be having their wedding in Italy. Photos came out on Monday, October 2 of the Venice festivities.\nHere, all about McRae’s career and what's known about his relationship with Taylor-Joy.\nPer McRae’s IMDB bio, McRae “was ‘discovered’ at the AMTC (talent competition) among 1,100 hopeful actors at age 12, where he won Over All Young Actor, 2006.” McRae starred in a short film, Brotherly, in 2008 and played Gene Grady in 2020’s How'dy!.\nMusic is McRae’s real focus though. His IMDB bio cites him as playing “guitar and piano” and singing “pop, folk, rockabilly, rock and musical theatre.” On his Instagram, McRae plugs his rock band More’s music, most recently posting footage of himself playing his song “Settled In” in April.\nMore is a two-member group that McRae and Kane Ritchotte (formerly of Portugal The Man) created and that is signed with Warner Records. The band is verified on Spotify and has been together for over three years now. They released the first half of their two-part EP, 1/2, last summer.\nIn a July 2020 interview with Rain magazine, McRae spoke about his history with Ritchotte and the creation process for 1/2. “The writing process was a span over three or so years,” he said. “Kane and I were doing solo projects individually and had a few songs we had written and recorded separately. We met up and decided it was fun to write together and bring our songs together. So we finished 10 songs over about three years.”\nAccording to More’s Spotify bio, McRae came to Los Angeles from the South a few years ago. As the band wrote, “Malcolm had only recently fallen in love with a young woman and followed his foolish heart, dropping everything to move to Los Angeles. Well, his heart was mistaken. The relationship was a disaster. But the music that followed wasn’t. Within a week of meeting, the two [McRae and Ritchotte] realized that the music they made together transcended what either was doing alone.”\nMcRae spoke to American Songwriter 10 months ago about how he worked as a paralegal in Pasadena, California, and wrote song lyrics for “Elaborate Attraction” while at his desk job.\nIn his Rain interview, McRae spoke more about the inspiration behind “Elaborate Attraction” and how his late father influenced its lyrics. “My dad was an investment banker,” McRae said. “He passed away when I was eighteen, but that song revolves around and is based on some of his life. He studied classics at an Ivy League school and so the reference to Joseph Campbell, that’s what we took the video from. We wanted it to be an antihero’s journey. All 17 points of Campbell’s hero journey… we wanted to make them super menial tasks with an incredibly small reward for each task. It symbolizes what the song is about which is nature versus nurture.” McRae’s brother Keene McRae directed the music video for the single, and its YouTube video has gotten more than 93,000 views.\nMcRae told Rain that music helped him and Ritchotte get through the coronavirus pandemic mental health-wise. “I’m grateful for the outlet and you don’t need many resources to write music, you know?” he said. “If we didn’t have that in this quarantine, I would be entirely morbidly depressed and unfulfilled. I mean, I don’t know how anybody’s survived. I don’t know how not everybody is writing an album right now.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae’s exact timeline is not clear nor has either explicitly confirm they're dating. But the 26-year-old actress spoke to ELLE three days after the Golden Globes, indicating she had a significant other in March 2021 while explaining why she was doing her Zoom interview from her bathroom.\n“My partner’s just come back from work, and he’s moving around all of his equipment, so this was the safe spot,” she said. She didn’t offer any more details on who he is, how long they’ve been together, and didn’t confirm outright that they were living together.\nTaylor-Joy did open up to Vanity Fair earlier this year about a past relationship ending right before she began production on Emma in March 2019, meaning her relationship with McRae is likely more recent.\n“Prior to filming [Emma] I’d just had a devastating breakup, and it had challenged everything,” she said. “I was just incredibly insecure and very, very unsafe in my own skin.” Taylor-Joy had been working constantly during that time, immersing herself in the characters she played while not taking the time to learn about who she is.\nShe could go into an art gallery and recognize the pieces each character she played would like, “but I had no idea what I liked,” she said. “I had no clue of what I would choose for myself. I’m sitting here talking to you, and for the first time, I’m like, I know what I like. I know what I, as a person, enjoy!… The whole of 2019 was me becoming a woman, essentially.”\nOn July 23, The Sun reported that McRae “has practically moved into [Taylor-Joy’s] L.A. home.”\n“They are inseparable and spend all of their time together,” a source close to Taylor-Joy told the outlet. “Her schedule is really hectic because she is so in demand following The Queen’s Gambit, but he is always there for her.”\nThe source added that “Malcolm is practically living with her at her home in L.A. now, and they spend every night together.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae proved their relationship was still going strong post-Labor Day when the two were photographed kissing in Venice by paparazzi. Taylor-Joy was at the festival to promote her upcoming film Last Night in Soho.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy posed side-by-side at Vanity Fair’s Oscars after-party. Taylor-Joy was dressed in a black sheer Dior corset dress alongside her partner.\n\nAhead of their Oscars red carpet debut, Taylor-Joy reflected on dating McRae to British Vogue in her cover story with them. “I said to my partner [the musician and actor Malcolm McRae] the other day that he was my hobby,” she said. “I see reading as something that I have to do. He loved it because he’s the same. I’ve finally found someone who will happily sit in silence with me reading. We’re basically 80 years old and seven at the same time and it works really well.”\nShe reflected on being long distance with him, as she owns a house in east London and is regularly traveling for film projects. “Yes, it is [hard], but it’s also kind of great because when you’re together you’re really valuing the time that you have. Everyday mundane activities are so full of joy. I love going to the petrol station with him and filling up the car and going to get breakfast.”\nCasual dating just wasn’t her style either, she added: “I was not a good dater and I’m quite glad to not be. I hear stories from my friends and I’m like, ’God, I would suck at that.’” \nTaylor-Joy and McRae didn't shy away from showcasing their love for each other during the screening for her film The Northman on April 5 in London. Both dressed chicly, Taylor-Joy and McRae kissed in front of photographers in one of their most public displays of affection yet.\nIn a subtle sign of their ties to each other, both Taylor-Joy and McRae follow each other on Instagram. Until recently, neither Taylor-Joy nor McRae posted about each other though or liked the other’s Instagram posts, but Taylor-Joy recently tagged McRae in a photo implying he was at the scene. Then McRae went Instagram official!\nOn October 20, 2021, McRae shared two shots of he and Taylor-Joy standing in a window’s reflection, smiling and holding hands. He captioned it, “Oof supremely happy.”\nIn the photos, Taylor-Joy is wearing a red razor-back tank top with white piping, and a long checkered shirt over it, her blonder hair pushed back with a pair of sunglasses. McRae is in a white t-shirt and black jeans. \nTaylor-Joy was photographed arriving at the Sydney airport in Australia in late June via private jet. As she reached up to brush her hair from her face, a sparkling rock was spotted on her ring finger. Rumors quickly spread that she is engaged to McRae.\nA person at the scene said, “She bounded off the plane and then seemed to flash the ring at her driver before getting in the car. She was either showing off the ring or doing a dance move. Either way, she looked ecstatic.”\nHer plane outfit included matching purple slacks and shirt and she was carrying her new cat, Kitsune, in a backpack with a window for her pet to enjoy the scene.\nTaylor-Joy and McRae may secretly be husband and wife. A source told Page Six that the couple quietly got married in an intimate courthouse wedding. On July 18, Taylor-Joy was photographed walking with McRae, wearing her engagement ring on her left ring finger. Neither McRae, Taylor-Joy, or Taylor-Joy's rep have yet to commented on the wedding reports as of July 19.\nOn Thursday, September 1, Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McCrae enjoyed a little PDA as they walked through the streets of Los Angeles during a heat wave. The couple held hands as they walked, and were photographed embracing and sharing a kiss here and there on their date night in West Hollywood.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a pale pink sundress with a square neckline with flower details down the front for each button. She carried a green sweater over her left hand, which obscured any potential sighting of a wedding or engagement ring. McRae was wearing a vintage green Nascar shirt over khaki pants.  \nTaylor-Joy and McRae were seen in Sydney's center for a Saturday night out, leaving popular party spot Frankie's in two stylish ensembles. The actress was wearing a bright purple mini dressed with a leather jacket and lace-up boots. She left her long blonde hair loose down her back, and wore dark red lipstick. By her side, McRae was rocking a grown out shag and a green turtleneck under a blazer with jeans. \nThe actress has been filming in Australia since may for the film Furiosa, of which she is the lead. After leaving the night club, they were escorted into a car and headed off.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, October 18, the couple enjoyed a lunch in Sydney at Mark And Vinny's spaghetti. As they waited for their food to arrive, they couldn't keep their hands off each other, leaning in to steal kisses and hug. At one point, McRae even gave Taylor-Joy's hand a chivalrous kiss in a romantic gesture.\nThe actress was wearing a vivid with matching lipstick and a pair of white mules with black designs. She covered it in a navy bomber jacket and pair of cat eye sunglasses. McRae was dressed in black jeans, a white t-shirt, and a grey button down over it. \nOn Sunday, December 25, Anya Taylor-Joy shared a glimpse of her holiday plans on Instagram, posting pictures of herself in bed with MacRae. \nMacRae was wearing a dark sleeping mask up on his forehead, and Taylor-Joy seemed to be in a fluffy white hat with ear flaps. On closer inspection, it is actually a white cat with gray ears. They both cuddled under the white sheets of their bed, looking sleepy and happy. \n“Merry Christmas to all you filthy animals, from our home to yours,” she wrote in the caption. \nThe couple made their award show debut on January 10, posing together at the Golden Globes, where Taylor Joy was a nominee. They showed PDA in front of the photographers.\nTaylor-Joy was photographed on Sunday, January 15, with McRae backstage at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles, held at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel. The actress was presenting an award at the ceremony alongside Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller. The couple were photographed sharing an intimate moment before the festivities where McRae appears to be adjusting her necklace.\nFor the event, Taylor-Joy wore a sheer, nude netted dress over a matching body-suit of opaque fabric and had her long hair piled into a tall knotted updo. She accessorized with diamond jewelry around her neck and one wrist and a pair of sandal heels with a rhinestone strap across her toes. McRae was wearing a traditional suit with an untraditional ribbon cravat under a white button-down shirt.\nTaylor-Joy gave her partner a romantic shoutout on her Instagram on Valentine's Day 2023, sharing footage of them kissing, and writing, “Mi amor, I'm all yours.”\nTen days after, the couple was photographed holding hands while out at London's Chiltern Firehouse on February 24, 2023. Taylor-Joy had been in town for the BAFTA Awards that previous weekend.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy put their couple style on display and signaled things were on and strong between them when they attended the Tiffany & Co The Landmark store reopening in New York City on April 27, 2023. Taylor-Joy wore a red lace dress while McRae was dressed in a black suit with a black choker.\nOn Thursday, Taylor-Joy and McRae were seen walking outside a friend's house in Los Angeles. It appeared that the musician was comforting the Queen's Gambit star, wrapping her arms around her and kissing her forehead. The pair arrived at the house with guitars and were accompanied by McRae's bandmate Kane Ritchotte.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a sleeveless white top and an asymmetrical mini skirt and black leather Maison Margiela loafers. \nTaylor-Joy and McRae never specified if they were actually married. Multiple sources close to the couple told the Daily Mail on September 29 that they would be wedding that weekend in Italy in front of 150 guests.\nA source said, “Anya and Malcolm are incredibly private and wanted to ensure their wedding was kept away from prying eyes. They both love Italy and always dreamed of tying the knot in a beautiful setting surrounded by their nearest and dearest. There will be no expense spared and their guests are bound to have an incredible time.”\nTaylor-Joy appeared in a beige bespoke Dior gown embellished with birds and flowers in photos of her posing on a window balcony. She wore her platinum hair half up, half down with a white veil. Guests included Cara Delevingne, Julia Garner, Nicolas Hoult, and Miles Teller.\nNeither Taylor-Joy nor McRae have confirmed news of their wedding themselves or shared official photos yet.\nTaylor-Joy appeared in a corseted, off-the-shoulders white minidress in the snaps, taken a day after the couple’s ceremony. Daily Mail reports that the newlyweds were photographed kissing on a Venetian water taxi and generally being affectionate.

{"title": "All About Ethan Slater, Ariana Grande’s New Boyfriend and <i>Wicked</i> Co-Star", "date": "2023-10-05 21:44:00", "text": "Just days after Ariana Grande's separation from her husband of two years, Dalton Gomez, was widely reported, news broke that Grande found love again...on the set of Wicked.\nGrande and her co-star Ethan Slater, who is also separated from his wife, started dating recently, as People, Entertainment Tonight, and TMZ reported on July 20, 2023. Slater and Grande's commonalities go beyond their work in Wicked, though: Both are Broadway alumni (Grande for her work in 13: The Musical, Slater for his in the Spongebob musical).\nHere's what to know about Slater and his history with Grande.\nSlater is a Gemini and celebrated his 31st birthday on June 2; he grew up in Washington, D.C. and attended Vassar College. His most high-profile role so far was starring as Spongebob in Broadway's SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical. It was a project he was involved in for years, starting when he was just 19.\n“Working on SpongeBob changed the way that I approach everything because I started working on it when I was 19, and it was seven years of development—from starting development until closing on Broadway,” he told Pop-Culturalist.com in August 2021. So it was like my full education, which is awesome. We approached it from this perspective, which came from [director] Tina [Landau], that this isn’t a show that is talking down to kids. This is a show that is funny; it’s funny, it’s visually stimulating, it’s physical humor. Kids like it because it taps into this optimism and heart; and adults like it because it taps into things they remember from their childhood. But it’s not a show that is solely designed for kids. It was meant to make us laugh while we were making it.”\nBoq notably has a big crush on Grande's character Glinda in Wicked. Slater and Grande have been shooting the film adaptation in the U.K. since December. Slater's casting in Wicked was announced in December 2022.\n.@ethansaslater has joined the @wickedmovie as Boq! https://t.co/hkOCQBVZCb\nBoth Slater and Grande are newly single after being married. People reported that Slater and his wife Lilly Jay were separated after news of his dating Grande broke on July 20. Jay and Slater started dating in 2012 and got married in November 2018. They welcomed their first child, a son, in August 2022.\nSlater celebrated Jay this Mother's Day on his Instagram account. He wrote, “Happy first Mother’s Day to the most loving caring and wonderful mom/person in the world. - from me and this little guy.” Grande had liked the post.\nHe also posted a tribute to her in November 2022, writing, “My best friend. 4 years married, 10 years together. And this is easily the best (and most *bizarre*) year yet.” Grande liked that post too.\nOn Saturday, July 22, a source who knows Lilly told ET that the new mother is “devastated” and that “this is not the future she had in mind.”\nThey added, “She's doing her best to get back on her feet. She's incredibly smart and driven...she is truly the best mother.”\nSlater had a public Instagram account when reports initially broke of his and Grande's dating. But shortly after the news stories spread, Slater went private on his Instagram. He had already limited comments on some posts beforehand.\nAfter filing for divorce from his wife Lilly Jay in late July and spending a month laying low, Slater returned to Instagram at the beginning of September to promote his role in Spamalot on Broadway.\nGrande liked the image in a show of support that got media attention.\n\nA source told People, “Ariana and Dalton separated in January. She and Ethan recently began dating, and he is separated from his wife.”\nUs Weekly received similar intel from its source: “Ariana and Ethan are dating; however things are fairly new. Ariana and Dalton split in January, and Ethan is separated from his wife. Ariana and Ethan have only recently begun seeing each other but they have a lot of fun together and are enjoying each other’s company.”\nEntertainment Tonight's source also stressed that this is very recent: “Ariana and Ethan recently started dating. They have a lot in common and have a lot of fun,” the source said. “They didn't start dating until both were broken up with their significant others. Ariana and Dalton remain friends.”\nTMZ, meanwhile, reported that Slater and Grande had been dating “several months ago during production” of Wicked, per its multiple sources. The insiders stressed that Slater and Grande did not start dating until after they were separated from their spouses. They were photographed sitting next to each other while celebrating Wicked co-star Michelle Yeoh's Oscar win in March.\nOn July 28, a source emphasized to ET that Slater and Grande started as friends, saying, “Ariana and Dalton both realized they were very different people and quietly separated earlier this year. Ariana and Ethan connected as friends first because they have a lot in common and many similar interests.” \n“While this entire situation has been blown out of proportion, it’s much different than what has been portrayed in public,” a friend close to the couple told People. “They are just trying to navigate their new relationship in private.”\nAnother source added, “They are doing their best to balance the fact that they are in the public eye with the desire to be respectful to all parties involved.”\nA source alleged to the Daily Mail in September 2023 that things had escalated between Grande and Slater, and they were living together in New York City as Slater prepares for his Spamalot role on Broadway. Neither Grande nor Slater confirmed the rumor.\nOn October 4, a source told Us Weekly the same. They said, “Ethan informed his friends and soon-to-be ex-wife [Lilly Jay] that he’s living with Ariana full-time in New York. They’re really happy and really good for each other. All of her friends love him.”\nIn an August 2021 interview with Pop-Culturalist.com, Slater discussed how he co-wrote the musical Edge of the World based on that loss. “One of the big things is the mining [of] my personal experience for writing,” he said. “When I was 7 years old, my mom died, and so that’s been a really big, formative thing in my life. She had left this huge imprint on me, even though I had so few memories. And that’s what happens to this character, Ben. He grows up not knowing his mom, being raised by a single dad, and yet the impact she has on his life and his life trajectory is immeasurable. So those are the two inspirational elements that came together.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "All About Chris Evans’ Wife Alba Baptista", "date": "2023-10-05 21:38:00", "text": "On November 10, People's newest Sexiest Man Alive Chris Evans revealed that he has been dating 26-year-old actress Alba Baptista for at least a year and “it's serious,” according to a source, who added,“They are in love, and Chris has never been happier. His family and friends all adore her.”\nIn January 2023, a source reiterated that to Us Weekly, describing them as having “gotten serious.” On Valentine's Day 2023, Evans himself shared a very public look inside their private relationship. He posted a video of photos from time together to honor his girlfriend.\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/kixfEDiZWv\nAnd in September 2023, the couple quietly got married, People reported.\nHere, everything to know about Baptista and their relationship timeline so far.\nThe actress is best known for her role on Netflix's Warrior Nun, her English-language debut. \nBaptista is from Portugal and was born in Lisbon. She has starred in several popular Portuguese films and TV shows, including A Impostora, Filha da Lei, A Criação, and Jogo Duplo. After Warrior Nun, she starred in the 2022 dramatic comedy, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris.\nOutside of acting, she has a passion for charity work and in 2018, worked at an orphanage in Cambodia focusing on education. She also speaks five languages, including Spanish, French, German, English, and her native Portuguese.\nThe almost a year estimate is partially based on some fan detective work. The couple follows each other on Instagram, though they haven't yet gone “Instagram official” by sharing photos of each other. Cosmopolitan reported that Baptista's mom used the same pumpkins seen on Evans' Instagram as her profile photo for the social media platform, tipping off the sleuths. He has also been liking all of Baptista's photos since October 13, as well as a few back-dated ones from July of this year and August of 2021. \nIn his interview for the Sexiest Man issue, Evans didn't get too specific about who he wanted to settle down with, but he did talk about wanting to take things further in his romantic relationships than he has so far.\n“That's absolutely something I want: wife, kids, building a family,” Evans said. “When you read about most of the best artists, whether it's actors, painters, writers, most of them [admit] it wasn't the work they made [that they are most proud of], it was about the relationships; the families they created, the love they found, the love they shared.”\nHe continued, “So it's also something through my long 41 years that also rings true. Those things are the most important. I love the idea of tradition and ceremony. I had a lot of that in my life, so the idea of creating that—I can't think of anything better.”\nLater in January 2023, a source told Us Weekly that he and Baptista were very serious as a couple. “Chris and Alba have gotten serious,” the source said. “This is the most committed anyone can remember him being in a very long time, if not ever.” \n“They spend most of their time at his place in Massachusetts and love the quiet life there, surrounded by nature and away from the spotlight,” the source added. “Chris was very open that he wanted to take his time before settling down.”\nPeople reported that Evans and Baptista got married at a private estate in Cape Cod over the weekend of September 9 and 10, 2023. Evans’ Marvel co-stars were seen at the ceremony, including  Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, in addition to actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. The couple’s reps did not immediately confirm the wedding news.\nAllegedly yes, per Page Six. The outlet reported on September 12 that the couple would be having a ceremony in Portugal. “There is going to be a second gathering in Portugal for members of Alba’s family who couldn’t be in Massachusetts,” a source said. “Sometime this week, I believe. Then they’ll depart from Portugal for their honeymoon.”\nA source spoke to People on September 11 about how Evans knew quickly after meeting Baptista in Europe that she was the woman with whom he wanted to build a life.\nEvans “has been ready to settle down for a while. He can’t wait to have a family. He was just waiting for the right girl,” the source said. Baptista “is beautiful, smart and just a good person. She is involved in charity work and truly cares about doing good. She is a very positive and happy person. It’s rubbed off on him. It's the best news that they are married.”\n“They got serious very quickly,” the source said of their relationship.“He kept saying he knew she was the one.”\n“[He] has been the happiest since they met,” the source added. “[She is] everything to him.”\nYes. A source told Entertainment Tonight on September 13, 2023, “Chris has been in love with Alba for a while. They share a special connection and are so happy to be husband and wife. Chris is in a really great place in his life. He feels happy with his career and was ready to settle down. He’s thrilled about this new chapter and is so excited to have a family with Alba one day.”\nHis biggest was on Valentine's Day 2023. He shared multiple Instagram Stories featuring videos and photos of them together.\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/kixfEDiZWv\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/P0VxoMphAs\nEvans has kept their relationship mostly private. He did discuss Baptista briefly in his September 2023 GQ interview, when explaining why he has been acting less.\nIn 2022, he worked nonstop on three different movies, something he regrets. That’s when he brought Baptista up: “My girlfriend that I’ve had for a while, when we began dating, I was like: ‘Yeah, I do one movie a year. I try to never work now.’ And then, after like a few months of dating, boom, guess what? We’re living in Atlanta for a year. Get ready. And even when that year was happening, I was like, man, never again.” \nHe also offered a little about her personality when discussing the reporter’s energy: “My girlfriend’s really big into people’s energies and first impressions,” he said. “I’m not so much, because I feel that I don’t always give off the same thing out of the gate. So I try to really reserve judgment. But you had a very, very nice energy when you first came in.”\nApparently! A source told Page Six that Meghan and Harry, who were visiting Portugal in late September 2023, ran into Baptista and Evans at a bar or restaurant there. It was not planned, the insider said, describing the run-in as “completely coincidental.” The couples didn’t know each other prior but ended up hanging out.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "The Complete Timeline of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 21:31:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe last few years have seen a lot of enormous changes in the British Royal Family, an entity known more for tradition than rapid growth. After the loss of Queen Elizabeth II, who ruled over the U.K. most of the 21st century, some people may be looking for some stability. If there's any couple in the family who offers that, it's Prince William and Kate Middleton.\nWilliam and Kate have had what appears on the outside to be a bit of a fairytale romance, from the storybook wedding to the picturesque family of five they have now. Sure, the full details of that fairytale aren't known, and some of what's been shown may be in part to help the royal family's image. But optics aside, there’s something about them that has captivated people since the beginning of their relationship. Here’s a look back at their journey, from college sweethearts to royal power couple.\nPrince William and Kate Middleton meet while both studying at St. Andrews University in Scotland. Rumor has it that William was won over after seeing Kate modeling at a student fashion show for charity (a show for which he reportedly paid £200 for a front row seat).\nOther rumors suggest that her reason for being at St. Andrews was entirely related to meeting her future husband.\nThe Crown historian Robert Lacey wrote in his 2020 book Battle of Brothers: William and Harry—The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult, that Kate was trying to manifest her future relationship with William when she was only 19.\n“Kate was very strategic,” Lacey said. “She gave up her place at one of Britain’s premier universities, Edinburgh, and opted for another one [St. Andrews] that probably didn’t have the same academic standard. She had already been to Edinburgh to get her flat accommodations sorted out but switched universities and switched her courses to history of art because that was William’s. She delayed her own education by a year and even takes the chance she won’t get into St. Andrews.”\nShe was not the only person making these choices. Applications to the school reportedly went up by 44% after it was announced that was William's choice of university. They might not all have been marriage hopefuls, but some probably were like Kate.\nHello! magazine reported that Prince William was moving from his dorm into a flat with three college friends, one of them “a pretty 20-year-old brunette” who, as you might guess, turned out to be Kate Middleton.\nHe allegedly started out as just her friend, before seeing her walk in a fashion show in this see-through dress on March 26, 2002.\n“She’s there and about to walk down the runway on the fashion show, and she strips off an extra layer of clothing,” Lacey explained. “Here is a very strategic lady who knows what she wants and has got it.”\nThey began dating soon after.\nWilliam and Kate are photographed together for the first time during a ski trip in Klosters, causing then-Prince Charles to threaten to sever ties with The Sun, the outlet that published the photos. Charles was said to have been “very disappointed” by the breach in an agreement between the press and Buckingham Palace that ensures royal children can continue their education without having their privacy intruded upon.\nBoth William and Kate graduate from St. Andrews. The Middletons later share a photo of them together on the day.\nThe couple attend Camilla's daughter Laura Parker-Bowles’ wedding, marking one of their first big public appearances together, and sparking speculation that they were serious enough to one day walk down the aisle together themselves.\nIn 2007, William and Kate took a time-out and broke up for a couple months. Kate took a vacation to Ireland with her friends afterwards, while William awkwardly fielded questions about “how things are going” with Kate.\nKate later said in 2010 during an interview after their engagement that in hindsight, she thinks it was healthy for them to have time apart.\n“I think I at the time wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person...You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realized,” she said. “Or I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger. I really valued that time for me as well although I didn't think it at the time, looking back on it.\"\nBy July of that same year, rumors began to swirl about a possible reconciliation as Kate is seen attending a Princess Diana tribute concert—though she sat two rows behind William with her sister Pippa.\nThe two are seen together again, back where it all began: the ski slopes. Photos show Kate and William together in Klosters as sources told newspapers that they were very much back together.\nWilliam graduates from his RAF training, with Kate at his side.\nWilliam proposes to Kate while on a trip to Kenya, with Princess Diana’s sapphire engagement ring. “We had a little private time away together with some friends, and I just decided it was the right time really,” William later said in their engagement interview. “We'd been talking about marriage or a while, so it wasn't a massively big surprise, but I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya.”\nPrince William and Kate Middleton get married in a fairytale ceremony at Westminster Abbey witnessed by nearly 72 million people worldwide. The bride did her own makeup, the groom wore sweat pads so that he wouldn’t sweat out of his uniform, and Ellie Goulding performed at the reception.\nIn marrying William, Kate gained the title Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Strathearn, and Lady Carrickfergus.\nAfter the wedding, the married couple settle in Wales and adopt a dog, an English Cocker Spaniel named Lupo.\nSt. James’ Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with the couple’s first child. During her pregnancy, she’s hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness.\nKate gives birth to Prince George, and steps out for post-baby photos.\nKensington Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with their second child. Kate had not reached the 12-week stage, but the Palace made the announcement because they felt they couldn’t keep the pregnancy under wraps from the press for much longer. Once again, Kate suffers from extreme morning sickness.\nKate gives birth to Princess Charlotte, who becomes fourth in line for the throne after Prince Charles, her father Prince William, and her older brother Prince George. She’s also the first to take up the title of Princess in 25 years, and is the highest ranking female in line for the throne.\nThe coupled made their red carpet debut at the British Academy Film Awards, where Prince William presented a BAFTA Fellowship award to Mel Brooks. Kate wore an off-the-shoulder tiered Alexander McQueen gown in a floral print.\nKensington Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with the couple’s third child. As with her previous two pregnancies, she suffers from hyperemesis gravidarum.\nKate gives birth to Prince Louis, who is now fifth in line for the throne. Though tradition dictated that Louis, as a male, would overtake Princess Charlotte for a place on the throne, the policy was amended prior to George's birth with the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. That made Charlotte the first female royal to trump a younger male sibling.\nKate and Prince were front and center at the marriage of his little brother, Prince Harry, to Meghan Markle.\nThe couple helped Harry and Meghan celebrate on their wedding day at their nuptials at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, England. “William was in a jokey, wonderful mood at the party,” a wedding guest told People at the time, adding that Kate was also in “great form.”\nThey added, “She and William were saying how thrilled they were to have their children there taking part.”\nAt Princess Eugenie's wedding, Kate and William are seen showing each other a little affection. Eugenie was marrying her husband Jack Brooksbank when the royal couple were seen holding hands in the pew.\n#RoyalWedding Aaahhh! My heart! 💕💞💑😍😍😍😍 #DukeandDuchessofCambridge pic.twitter.com/Xup5ouu67a\nKate and William tend to be hands off when out in public.\nAfter lockdown began in the U.K., the couple spoke with the BBC in a rare joint interview, discussing what it's like to parent through a pandemic.\n“It's been ups and downs, like a lot of families self-isolating,” Kate said. “The children have got such stamina, I don't know how. Honestly, you get to the end of the day and you write down the list of all the things that you've done in that day. So, you pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day—they have had a lovely time—but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.”\nNine years after welcoming their cocker spaniel, Ludo, into their lives, the couple announced they had bid him farewell. They shared a handsome portrait of the dog on Instagram with a heartfelt goodbye.\n“Very sadly last weekend our dear dog, Lupo, passed away,” the post read. “He has been at the heart of our family for the past nine years and we will miss him so much. - W & C.”\nApril of 2021 was the 10-year anniversary of the couple's marriage, otherwise known as the tin anniversary. To celebrate, they shared some new portraits by Chris Floyd at Kensington Palace.\nThey also posted a video of themselves with their children walking through the sand dunes in Norfolk, England, thanking everyone for the well wishes on the occasion of their anniversary.\nQueen Elizabeth appoints Kate Middleton as a sponsor of the naval battleship HMS Glasglow. The office requires Kate to maintain a “strong and enduring personal connection to the vessel and her crew, often supporting milestones, events and deployments.”\n“Her Majesty the Queen has approved the appointment of my wife Catherine as Sponsor of the superb ship we see taking shape outside—HMS Glasgow,” Prince William said in the announcement. “I know that Catherine will be delighted to join you here in Glasgow for the naming ceremony in due course.” \nThe couple got all dressed up for the No Time to Die premiere in London, posing with Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. The royal family members were guests of honor at the event. \nKate wore a Jenny Packham capelet gown covered in gold sequins. \nKate and William enjoyed their first Earthshot Awards, at Alexandra Palace in London. The environmental initiative was launched by William, and he was tasked with giving a speech at the ceremony. A photo shows them sharing a sweet moment together behind-the-scenes.\nAlso at the event was Emma Thompson, Emma Watson, David Oyelowo, and Mo Salah. Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, KSI, and Coldplay performed.\nEnjoying another fun premiere, the coupled hit the red carpet for Top Gun in the U.K. \nKate wore a black Roland Mouret gown, with an off-the-shoulders, white wraparound detail. \nThe couple's first official portrait was unveiled at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum. Originally commissioned in 2021 by the Cambridgeshire Royal Portrait Fund, it was painted by Jamie Coreth. Coreth is an award-winning portrait artist.\nThe Duke and Duchess take their three children to visit the Lambrook school, where they will be newly attending. The preview day offered the family a chance to get to know the facilities and teachers.\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis were all wearing their school uniforms. \nQueen Elizabeth II dies on September 8, sending the family into mourning. There is also a great deal of change in terms of titles and responsibilities. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge became the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and of Rothesay, and on September 9, his father conferred the title of Prince and Princess of Wales. \nIn his address to the nation following the immediate news of his mother's death, King Charles III said, “With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the centre ground where vital help can be given.”\nThe Princess of Wales was a title once held by William's mother, Princess Diana. \nAlong with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, William and Kate visit Windsor Castle to view flowers and gifts left by citizens to honor the late Queen.\nThe couple attends Queen Elizabeth's funeral at Westminster Hall after escorting her coffin from Buckingham Palace.\nThey post their farewells to her on Twitter with a photo of the procession.\nGoodbye to a Queen, a mother, a grandmother and a great grandmother. pic.twitter.com/hKEI9RcAOp\nKate and William attended the Festival of Remembrance, a ceremony dedicated to the day the Allies and Germany signed the armistice that ended World War 1 in 1918 for Europe.\nAt the commemorative concert at the Royal Albert Hall later that evening, Kate paid tribute to the late Queen by wearing some of her famous jewelry: her Japanese pearl choker necklace along with her Bahrain diamond and pearl drop earrings.\nThe Princess of Wales shared her Together at Christmas carol service on ITV after filming it at Westminster Abbey, for the second year in a row. The event was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth's memory and attended by William, George, and Charlotte.\nHarry and Meghan's docuseries is released on Netflix, and it was reported that Kate and William refused to watch it.\nVanity Fair wrote, “While aides will be watching the series closely, along with the royals’ lawyers, the palace are reluctant to comment on the show because they don’t want to feed what has become a media frenzy.”\nAnother source told Page Six that William and Kate haven't watched the series.\n“William and Kate’s aides have briefed them on the show, but don’t expect the couple to sit down in their cottage with a bowl of popcorn to tune in themselves,” the insider said.\nLater in the month, they must have acquired more details, because a source told Us Weekly on December 22 that Kate felt “betrayed” by the situation.\n“Kate feels hurt and betrayed that Harry would do this to her, too, especially as the pair used to be so close,” they said.\nAs for William he “isn’t planning to give his side of the story or openly retaliate.”\nAfter the docuseries, Kate and William were hit with another wave of bad publicity when Harry's memoir Spare was officially released, making things even icier between the two couples. A source who knows both couples told Entertainment Tonight in a report published January 12 that “[their] relationship has completely broken down.”\nA separate source said Kate felt “hurt and disappointed” over what Harry shared about her in Spare because she believed “private matters had been made public.”  \nKate and William marked British Mother's Day on their Instagram, sharing new photos of Kate with the couple's three children. “Happy Mother’s Day from our family to yours ❤️,” the couple wrote.\nThe royal couple celebrated their 12 year anniversary with an adorable photo on Instagram in which they're sitting on matching bikes and the prince has his arm around the shoulder of his princess. They're both dressed casually in jeans, and Kate is wearing a lacy white button down while William is in navy blue.\n“12 years ❤️,” they captioned the photo.\nA source spoke to Us Weekly about how Kate and William’s relationship is going, saying “more than anything, they’re proud of their marriage and beautiful family.”\n“William and Kate are more in sync than ever,” a palace insider told the outlet. “They cherish what they have with each other. For them, family comes first, and it always will.”\nThe source said the challenges the couple has faced in the last year, including the death of Queen Elizabeth II, have strengthened their relationship. “They’re in awe of each other,” the source said. “William tells anyone who will listen that he couldn’t do it without Kate, and she echoes that right back.”\nThey’ve also become slightly more comfortable showing PDA, although they are still very reserved in public: “William used to be quite awkward about showing too much affection, but Kate’s helped him relax.”\nA source told Us Weekly that Kate and William’s marriage isn’t complete smooth sailing. “Kate and William have been having ups and downs in their marriage like everyone else,” the source said. “But they’re focused on their royal duties and doing that as a unit.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "The 40 Best-Reviewed Workout Clothes on Amazon (That Happen to be Under $40)", "date": "2023-10-09 14:01:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n“Squat proof and comfy. Even my ex contacted me after posting this on my story.”\nIt’s not exactly a secret that buying cute workout clothes can help motivate you to get moving. We ELLE fashion editors fully endorse this method should you face a lack of drive, or perhaps you just want to treat yourself to a few chic new sets. That works, too. (Heck, even if you have no intention of working out, athleisure is for everyone.) \nUnfortunately, there are a lot of hidden costs when it comes to getting some exercise. From workout sneakers to pricey memberships at exclusive fitness clubs, there are so many costs that add up—even without the optional $15 green juice. The last thing you need is to spend a chunk of change on the very clothes you plan to sweat in. Thankfully, Amazon has a huge selection of wallet-friendly workout clothes that are too cute to stay hidden in your closet. From flirty skorts to functional workout leggings, we scoured the retailer for the best Amazon workout sets and clothes, as confirmed by thousands of satisfied customer reviews, in order to help you get stylish, affordable, and comfortable looks all while enjoying fast and free Prime shipping. \nPlus, with Amazon Prime Big Deal Days just around the corner (October 10 and October 11), these prices are likely to dip even lower. Ahead, find our ultimate guide to Amazon activewear finds under $50 that boast a quality that feels thrice the price. Making your purchase all the more worthwhile, these pieces are also great for lounging, working from home, or styling up with the best 2023 fashion trends\n for afternoon brunch or happy hour. \nWe’re big fans of the one-piece here at ELLE. It’s stylish, sexy, functional, and EASY. Plus, it eliminates the problem of your tee or tank top flopping into your face or riding up with every downward-facing dog. \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 90%Nylon, 10% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I love the ribbed look. Definitely surprised to find such a great, quality jumpsuit on Amazon. It’s true to size. I’ve ordered multiple colors. I love it so much.”\nWhy sacrifice style for functionality when you can have both? This ribbed one-shoulder sports bra and leggings set comes in six muted colorways and is sure to keep you comfortable and supported.\nSizes: XS-M \nMaterial: 92% Nylon, 8% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I love everything about this set. It’s ribbed, and the fabric feels wonderful...The fabric is both rich and luxurious.

Plus, the square neckline is very on-trend. \nSizes: 2XS-XL\nMaterialL: 81% Polyamide, 19% Lycra \nCustomer review: “The fit was great and it didn’t give my 32DD bust even a hint of uniboob problems. Only thing that some people might dislike is even though it has removable cups if you have a tendency to nip out hard it will show through the cups a little.”\nWho said activewear had to be boring? Check out these printed biker shorts that come in a ton fun prints and feature flattering seams above the booty. \nSizes: 2XS-3XL \nMaterial: 75% Nylon, 25% Spandex\nCustomer review: “When I say these are my favorite work out shorts. They do not have a front seam so you don’t have to worry about it being uncomfortable while you’re moving around, and the waist seam is tight but not uncomfortable so they never slip down. They are not the slightest bit see though...not to mention how flattering they are, i have them in 6 colors.”\nThis seamless bra and shorts set comes in eight sophisticated shades with a ribbed detail that gives way to just enough elasticity so it remains ridiculously comfortable while keeping you supported. \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 90% Nylon, 10% Elastane\nCustomer review: “It fits perfectly. It looked like I was photoshopped in real life. The top has padding in it so it will shape you and push you up, and the bottoms are very secure and will suck you in.”\nFor a durable pair of ankle leggings that are sure to flatter you from every angle, we think we’ve found a winner. This nylon-spandex style has a seamless, no-dig waistband and is ideal for those who prefer lighter compression out of their leggings. Not to mention these also feature deep pockets so you can go hands-free (the way to be).\nSizes: XS-2XL\nMaterial: 80% Nylon, 20% Spandex\nCustomer review: “This pair in particular was far better for me personally than its ‘buttery soft’ counterparts. I’ve had six kids, so I have mama fluff and prefer athletic pants with more waist support. These stay tight and in place all day and help flatten my tummy.”\nDesigned to offer medium support for A to C cup, this versatile workout tank with a built-in bra and elegant twist detailing at the back will transform your athleisure game. \nSizes: XS-XL\nMaterial: 75% Polyester, 25% Spandex\nCustomer review: “The coverage is great, and I can wear it to sleep without my girls falling out of it, to my Turbo Kick class, and to play volleyball and feel fully supported. It is also surprisingly stretchy, enough that I can pull it up or down to nurse my baby.”\nMany of the 33 color options here come with a three-piece set: bike shorts, a short-sleeve crop top, and a spaghetti strap sports bra.  Reviewers mention the material is thick and compressive in the best possible ways. \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 90% Nylon, 10% Spandex\nCustomer review: “An absolute must-get.

Squat proof and comfy. Even my ex contacted me after posting this on my story.” \nA white tank is my personal favorite when it comes to workout tops. This elegant padded high-high top looks as stunning for a day out as it does in the gym. Plus, reviewers confirm how ridiculously comfortable and flattering it is.\nSizes: S-XL\nMaterial: N/A \nCustomer review: “I could easily own every color they make, wear one every day and replace my actual bras. They are that comfortable!”\nElevate your leggings look with this high-neck top that features a built-in sports bra. Done in 10 sophisticated colors and super-soft polyamide, this second-skin active top is great for a workout just as much as it is for going out.\nSizes: XS-XL\nMaterial: 81% Polyamide, 19% Spandex\nCustomer review: “It’s nearly impossible for me to find a tight and flattering tank crop top that covers my side boob like this one does. Thick, buttery soft material with no rips/tears, and it’s comfortable?!? I literally don’t have a single complaint.”\nLooking for a perky lift while keeping everything in? This flattering pushup tank will carry you through your workout in style. \nSizes: S-XL\nMaterial: 77% Polyamide, 23% Spandex\nCustomer review: “This bra feels very well made and has a buttery soft feel.

Two words: deep pockets.\nSizes: XS-2XL\nMaterial: 88% Polyester, 12% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I’m an avid runner and have gone through hundreds of pairs of running shorts, and these are by far the best ones. They fit perfectly, they’re high waisted and also aren’t too short so they stop your thighs from chafing on longer runs. Added bonus, the side pocket kept my phone in place perfectly so I no longer have to wear a running belt. The added weight didn’t make my shorts slide down, either.”\nAlready have a favorite sports bra? Throw one of these breathable ribbed tanks on top that come in a pack of four in various colors. With over 39,000 reviews, shoppers rave they’re also great for just about any leisurely activity. \nSizes: S-2XL\nMaterial: 92% Cotton, 8% Spandex\nCustomer review: “Something to sleep in or wear under a sweater. Very comfortable, absolutely love.”\nJoggers and leggings are both top-tier pant styles in their own right—separately. So the idea of putting them together into one hybrid pant? Genius. With a little extra give for those who prefer it in and out of the gym, this sweat-wicking pair has a slim fit and smoothing high waistband. \nSizes: XS-2XL\nMaterial: 75% Nylon, 25% Spandex\nCustomer review: “One of the best combos since PB&J. The style is perfect and the comfort level is too! I work with animals all day so not only is comfort an issue, so is durability, flexibility, and style. These pants meet every single one! Plus they almost repel fur!”\nFor when you have the gym at 6 and dinner with the girls at 7. This long sleeve ribbed crop top is the perfect top to transition through all parts of your busy day.

A mesh lining also helps keep you cool.\nSizes: XS-XL\nMaterial: 71% Polyamide, 29% Spandex\nCustomer review: “This is my favorite sports bra right now! Perfect amount of support for being a 34DD.

{"title": "The Best Documentaries and Docuseries to Watch on Netflix", "date": "2023-10-07 13:00:00", "text": "Netflix has a fantastic collection of documentaries or docuseries, from gripping true-crime tales to eye-opening environmental exposés to intimate looks into the lives of your favorite musical artists. Even dedicated documentary aficionados can find new films on the streaming service, but dabblers in search of something fresh to watch will be satisfied by the list below. \nIf you’re in the mood for something breezy, fun, yet educating, try a food and travel series like David Chang’s Ugly Delicious, where the Momofuku chef embarks on culinary adventures with his celebrity friends. For super fans of pop culture, Netflix has docs on stars like Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, Pamela Anderson, and Beyoncé, in particular the latter’s opus, Homecoming. And if you’re a true crime fanatic, the streamer covers everything from murder to cults, all with a healthy dose of mayhem for added entertainment.\nScroll through below to to discover 35 remarkable documentaries currently available for your viewing pleasure on Netflix. \nThis doc tells a fairly recent story, covering the highly unusual events surrounding the GameStop stock rise of early 2021. Amateur investors organized primarily on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets faced off against Wall Street's hedge funds. Disgusted with market manipulation by some of the richest people in the world, they supported the struggling video game retailer and caused its stock price to climb astronomically. The hedge funds lost money and the response from financial institutions exposed the hypocrisy in the system. If you gleaned some details from social media at the time, this film will fill in the blanks and then some.\nWatch Here\nThe FLDS (Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) is a secretive and highly insular world, and Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey gives a rare, deep look into the church for outsiders. The polygamous sect broke away from the mainstream Mormon Church long ago and were under the rule of charismatic leader, Warren Jeffs. Interviews with people who escaped FLDS include their personal experiences of arranged marriages and systemic abuse within the community. The picture of religious extremism is dark, but the survivors ability to transform and thrive is inspirational.\nWatch Now\nIn the 1980s, the Rajneeshpuram commune, a controversial spiritual community, consumed a swathe of rural Oregon. The series traces the path that the guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh took through the area with the help of his most devoted and controlling follower, Ma Anand Sheela. The events that unfolded are very well-remembered in that part of the state, so the docuseries is full of fascinating interviews and first-hand footage of the increasingly sinister antics of the group. You'll be quickly absorbed in the inner workings of the commune and figuring out who the real villains and heroes of the story were.\nWatch Now\nDirected by the acclaimed filmmaker Martin Scorsese, the docuseries Pretend It's a City follows author and humorist, Fran Lebowitz, as she walks the streets of her favorite place on earth. Scorsese and Lebowitz are friends, and he clearly delights in her observations about NYC, how it has changed over the years, and in the stories of her own life—which is a fascinating one! The show is a comforting, nostalgic glimpse into a landscape that is both familiar and constantly changing, with a host who has seen it all.\nWatch Now\nCraig Foster is both a filmmaker and free diver, who forms a bond with a wild octopus during his trips underwater to the kelp forests of South Africa. The documentary shares their intimate interactions over an entire year and Foster honors his new friend's intelligence, resilience, and beauty in the clips he catches of her life. His octopus teacher profoundly increases his appreciation for the ocean and the film illustrates our connection to it, and all marine life, as fellow living creatures. \nWatch Now\nDisclosure explores the portrayal of transgender people in film and television through interviews with activists, performers, and scholars. In addition to being a fascinating historical analysis of cinema at large, it shows how cisgender actors are commonly promoted to play trans characters, often relying on caricatures and stigmatizing portrayals. The doc makes a clear case for why real representation matters on every level, from social to economic to political.\nWatch Now\nPamela Anderson's life story has been a subject of much scrutiny and often used without her permission for sensational stories and other people's profit. This doc made with Netflix is from her perspective, exploring her career from Playboy model to today, her relationship with Tommy Lee, the infamous sex tape, and her reaction to Hulu's Pam and Tommy. It includes intimate interviews and appearances from her kids, and most importantly, Anderson's permission.\nWatch Now\nCharles Cullen worked for 16 years as a nurse in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and killed as many as 40 people in nine different hospitals. Cullen was under suspicion for a long time, but he was continuously shuttled to new jobs as institutions sought to protect themselves from liability. He was finally taken in with the help of another nurse, Amy Loughren, who got a confession out of her former friend. This doc was additionally fictionalized on Netflix in The Good Nurse, starring Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne.\nWatch Now\nGirl in the Picture is a true-crime documentary that covers the story of Tonya Hughes, also called Sharon Marshall. Tonya was kidnapped by Franklin Delano Floyd, who raised her as his daughter—before marrying her. Tonya was allegedly killed by a hit-and-run driver in Oklahoma City in 1990, leaving behind a son named Michael. Michael was taken out of Floyd's charge, and it was discovered he was not the boy's biological father. This started an unraveling of Floyd's many crimes, and the fact he had been on the run as a fugitive from Georgia since 1973. \nWatch Now\nThis doc offers a behind-the-scenes look at Jennifer Lopez's halftime performance at Super Bowl LIV in 2020 alongside Shakira. The film incorporates the personal and professional challenges J.Lo faced in the lead-up to the performance, including the intense scrutiny of the media and the pressure to deliver an incredibly memorable show. \nWatch Now\nDr. James Marion Sims was a prominent fertility doctor who exploited and abused his patients for decades, violating their trust by using his own sperm to impregnate them without their consent. The doc interviews the women he betrayed and their families, explaining how Sims was able to continue his unethical practices with impunity for so long. It connects Sims to the urgent need for greater accountability and oversight in the healthcare industry, and for teaching patients to advocate for themselves.\nWatch Now\n“Vegan Queen” Sarma Melngailis was famous for her recipes and vegan restaurant that attracted celebrities from all over. But then she met a man. This docuseries is about how Melngailis fell for the manipulations of Shane Fox, a guy who promised immortality for her and her dog. Soon her life was falling apart, and while there's plenty of testimony from observers of her wild ride, the woman are the center of it all gets interviewed as well. \nWatch Now\nThis documentary shares a message directly from the earliest spokespeople of conversion therapy: it doesn't work. Conversion therapy is an abusive tactic to suppress and abuse LGBTQ+ people, and it hasn't waned in popularity since its advent in the 1970s. This film covers the beginnings of the movement with interviews from queer people who now admit they never changed, and why it's so important to come forward decades later.\nWatch Now\nThe infamous Simon Leviev was a pro at making women trust him after matching on the dating app Tinder. He claimed to be the heir to a diamond mogul and was seemingly able to back up these claims with outrageous displays of wealth. Then, all of the sudden, he'd need a little loan. While you might scream in frustration watching woman after woman get taken in by Leviev, the doc does explain how anyone could get taken in by a conscienceless scammer under the right circumstances.\nWatch Now\nJohn Wayne Gacy is a very well-known serial killer, partly because he was so prolific (he killed over men in about a four year timespan) and because he dressed up as a clown. But if you want to delve deeper than these two very striking facts, this doc goes very deep into Gacy's history and includes new audio of the murderer talking with his defense team about his reasons for killing, and how he got away with it for so long.\nWatch Now\nThe models for Abercrombie & Fitch might be nice to look at, but this documentary delves into the unsexy side of the century-old company. If you grew up in the nineties, looking at the history of the store's rise and fall will bring back a lot of memories. And if you didn't, this will give you a deeper understanding of fashion, trends, and how ugly things can get in the retail market.\nWatch Now\nMost people associate Bob Ross with “happy little trees,” but the behind-the-scenes story paints a very different picture. This doc won't ruin your image of Mr. Ross, thank goodness, but it will shine a light on the destructive effect money can have on people after the person they loved is gone.\nWatch Now \nAre you a royal family follower solely for the conspiracy theories associated with the Windsors? Have you watched every documentary ever about Scientology? This 2015 docuseries has you covered.\nWatch Now\nSamin Nosrat teaches foodies about the four essential elements of cooking good food. You'll become an expert on the title subjects—and want to cook and eat everything.\nWatch Now\nFilmmaker Coodie has been following Kanye West since the advent of his career, long before his recent controversies, so the doc contains the sort of intimate footage most music biographers can only dream about. The three-part series contains so many details about one man's path to world-wide fame and fortune, and all the ups-and-downs such a journey entails. \nWatch Now\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more. Her first book, The Lonely Hunter, will be released by Dial Press in February 2022.\nHilary Weaver is a freelance writer based in New York who writes about politics, queer issues, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and every woman the Queen has ever made a dame.

We can't wait! \nWATCH NOW \nThe looks! The fashion! The shade! With 14 seasons and several spinoffs in the books (so far), Drag Race remains one of the most thrilling reality shows on television, as queens from all walks of life compete for the title of “next drag superstar” under the guidance of Mama Ru.

I'll take two!\nOne word, seven letters, and everyone’s wallets start shaking—G-L-O-S-S-I-E-R. \nBlack Friday is almost here, and by almost, I mean there’s still time to get your Glossier shopping game plan together. Are you on the market for a new perfume? Well, Glossier You now comes in an extra-large size so you can never run out of your favorite scent. Or maybe you’re ready to upgrade your Perfecting Skin Tint to the brand’s new Stretch Foundation. Regardless of your wishlist must-haves, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are like early Christmas gifts for beauty shoppers where everything is practically discounted, and brands offer free gifts galore—especially all the great deals everyone’s favorite pink brand offers.\nThis year, Black Friday falls on November 24.\nGlossier hasn’t announced any official Black Friday or Cyber Monday plans, as it’s still a bit early for BFCM deals. However, if past sales are any indication, Glossier may be giving customers a sitewide discount again. Last year, the brand offered tiered discounts—20 percent off sitewide and 30 percent off qualifying purchases—and holiday kits. In the interim, scroll down for the absolute best ELLE-approved Glossier products to add to your wishlist ahead of the sales to prep you for purchasing. \nTrade in your traditional foundation brush for Glossier's gua sha-inspired own, designed to contour the face. It features a swivel lid to protect the bristles, which are dense yet soft enough to make liquid application streak-free. \nFormulated to give you a personalized scent experience, You by Glossier is a medley of white florals and peppercorns that warms up when settled on the skin. Plus, the You perfume now comes in an extra-large size to keep the good vibes going longer. \nKeep all your travel-sized goods organized in the Beauty Bag, which has several compartments, a wipeable exterior, and removeable interior for the heavy packer.\nNail the clean, flawless complexion in two steps.

Once your base is set, add a flush of color to your cheeks and eyelids with the Cloud Paint, feather your lashes Lash Slick, and smooth and shape your brows with Boy Brow. \nWith this set, your shower routine is covered in four steps. Double cleanse with the oil wash and soap bar before nourishing your body with the cream and oil mist—all created in Glossier’s light, orange blossom scent.  \nFans of Glossier You can outfit their favorite space in the brand’s iconic scent.

{"title": "15 Hyaluronic Acid Serums for Radiant Skin Year-Round", "date": "2023-10-06 21:40:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n Plump up the volume. \nEach skin care collection houses a bevy of serums that take on a heavy responsibility. Serums packed with salicylic or glycolic acid are asked to address pesty breakouts; vitamin C helps to brighten the dark spots left behind from said breakouts, and niacinamide and peptides smooth skin, among many other benefits. However, if there’s face serum your beauty arsenal should keep in stock, it’s hyaluronic acid.\nNo need to second guess what the purpose of a hyaluronic acid serum is—a close look at the name will tell you all you need to know about the popular ingredient: retaining moisture is its primary goal. “Serums are low viscosity, thinner liquids that are typically formulated to be used under a moisturizer. Hyaluronic acid is a humectant,” Dr. Camille Howard, NY-based dermatologist and founder of Girl+Hair, tells ELLE.com. \n\nLike a tall glass of water on a hot day, hyaluronic acid allows your skin to soak up all that hydration so you can look fresh and plump throughout the day. Choosing the right serum for your skin type doesn’t need to be complicated. We consulted Dr. Camille Howard, and several customer reviews to find the 15 best simple-yet-effective hyaluronic acid serums to incorporate into your routine.\nNeostrata’s iteration of a hyaluronic acid serum exfoliates and soothes. Dr. Howard recommends this serum because it “combines three types of hyaluronic acid and also harnesses the power of lactic acid. In one treatment serum, you can enjoy the benefits of alpha hydroxy acids and humectants,” she explains.\nSize: 1.7 fl oz\nNeostrata star rating: 4.5/5 stars \nA Neostrata reviewer said: “This was a great product! I liked that there wasn’t really a scent to it. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day. I also feel like my skin was brighter and smoother after using this.”\nSeveral factors can contribute to the skin looking dull and lifeless. Hydra-Hyal from Filorga is a lightweight, fast-absorbing serum that restores radiance, plumps, and firms the skin using five types of hyaluronic acid. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nFilorga rating: 4.8/5 stars \n“The light, fragrant smell initially threw me off, but after massaging this gel-like formula into my skin, all my worries vanished. My skin drinks this serum up, as it melts into my skin and gives me a fresh-out-the-spa glow. Plus, it's formula works well with my Solawave—A+ in my book!”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor \nRadiant, bright skin has always been one of Dr. Dennis Gross’s top goals for its consumers. Thankfully, the brand doesn’t skimp on products that address those concerns, especially regarding this hyaluronic acid serum. A powerful blend of hyaluronic acid, ceramides, watermelon extract, and more skin-saving ingredients work hard to improve the skin’s appearance.\nSize: 1 fl oz \nNordstrom star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nA Nordstrom reviewer said: “I received a sample of this and was a little skeptical, especially due to the price - how much could this really do for me? It turns out, it can do a lot! Just a few drops and my skin felt so balanced and soft - this seems to moisturize all the layers of your skin. Dr. Dennis Gross’s products are pretty effective. I do hope this comes back into stock soon!”\nUsing too many active ingredients can weaken your skin’s barrier, so Skinfix formulated the perfect antidote. The creamy solution soothes the skin and protects the barrier without disrupting the work of the other actives in your routine.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I love this product. This serum manages to hydrate my extremely dehydrated skin without feeling heavy. I ended up buying the lotion and face cream as well. But I feel like if you have dehydrated skin and could only use one of their products, this would be it.”\nThis serum from The Inkey List costs as much as your morning latte and gives your skin a fresh, wide-awake look and feel. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer said: “This hyaluronic acid serum is super hydrating, and you can’t beat the price point! A little goes a long way with this serum. I use it as part of my morning and bedtime skincare regimen, and I love it!”\nCrow’s feet, dry patches, and other terrors threaten our journey to glowy skin. Skinceuticals whipped together hyaluronic acid, licorice root, and proxylane to maintain the skin’s elasticity and smooth over any harsh lines or wrinkles.  \nSize: 1 fl oz\nDermstore star rating: 4.76/5 stars\nA Dermstore reviewer said: “I love this product for its hydrating properties, but really it goes above and beyond hydration. Excellent overall serum!”\nBeyond its pretty pink packaging, there is a lot to love about this serum. Antioxidants and proteins support hyaluronic acid to provide maximum plumpness and hydration. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn ELLE editor says: “Not all hyaluronic acids are the same (obviously, you the person who is reading this, knows this, hence why you're scrolling through this article.) I learned a few years ago that hyaluronic acids have different weights, and much like a stock portfolio, you want variation for your balance in your skin. This one contains five different weighted ones, as well as vegan silk protein. I like that this feels like a substantial, thick serum, and putting it on gives my skin an instantly glossiness, plus nourished feeling. It has a slight fruity scent too, so it feels like I'm giving my skin a treat.”   — Kathleen Hou, Beauty Director, ELLE\nIf smooth skin is what you’re after, L’Oreal’s Revitalift serum delivers that and then some. Each use rejuvenates the skin and reveals a youthful glow.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I use this every morning and night. I have about 3 different serums and recently bought this one and it [is] my absolute favorite. I returned 2 of the other serums for a refund because I love this one so much.”\nAll skin types can benefit from this La Roche-Posay serum, which combines the powerful benefits of hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 to slow signs of aging and boost hydration. \nSize: 1 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn ELLE editor says: “I just finished a bottle of this serum. I love to travel with it as it leaves my skin super hydrated and absorbs quickly into my skin. It plays well with my other products and have never experienced pilling, which makes for a smoother morning skin care routine.” — Danielle James, Digital Beauty Director, ELLE\nDry, dull skin doesn’t stand a chance against this serum, which is formulated with hyaluronic acid and proteins to turn back the hands of time so your skin stays youthful longer.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “Hands down the best serum I’ve used— and I’ve used a lot! It is a small fortune; however, it’s worth every penny.”\nStrawberries taste great in smoothies. However, many are unaware of its great skincare benefits, as they are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Eminence puts strawberries to the test in its  Hyaluronic Hydrator serum, a lightweight serum packed with the delicious fruit and rhubarb to fight premature aging.\nSize: 1.2 fl oz\nDermstore star rating: 5/5 stars\nA Dermstore reviewer said: “Super lightweight and smells amazing! It makes my skin so soft and plump looking. I wash my face in the morning and put this on and it keeps my face hydrated all day without it feeling oily. It works great with other serums/lotions and makeup. Definitely try it!!!”\nB5 and hyaluronic acid join forces to drench your skin in hydration so well that you’ll want to stock up on more. Good thing it costs less than $15.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Yes, this is the real deal. Finally, a skincare product I can tell works, and I now buy [it] regularly. My skin literally drinks this in like a sponge in a puddle of water. A dime-sized drop of this covered my entire face and was immediately absorbed. Works beautifully and easily in my facial regimen.”\nFake a glow-from-within look with Neutrogena’s cult-favorite Hydro Boost serum. The formula locks in moisture to treat the driest of skin.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This moisturizer is amazing! The smell of it is refreshing, and it took some time to get used to, but now I love the smell. It’s the softest I’ve ever felt my skin, even when I get occasional breakouts. One pump is enough for the whole face; worth my buy!”\nWhile it’s not the typical packaging for a serum, the Isdin hyaluronic acid ampoules give your skin just the right amount of magic with each tube. The booster comprises two different forms of hyaluronic banding together for one goal: maximum hydration. \nSize: 10 ampoules (2ml) \nIsdin star rating: 5/5 stars\nAn Isdin reviewer said: “I love how my skin feels tighter. Easy to use. I get two days of liquid before using [the] next ampoule.”\nEvery skincare newbie needs a place to start. Enter: Cerave’s affordable line of simple skincare, including this gentle serum that glides on like butter and soothes dehydrated skin. This fragrance and oil-free formula protects the skin barrier, making it an excellent serum for eczema-prone skin. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “This serum is better than two other more expensive ones I’ve tried. It makes my sensitive skin feel soft and look brighter without any irritation. It even made a seborrheic keratosis growth on my hairline almost disappear after only a couple of weeks.”\nThink of hyaluronic acid as a serum that helps your skin preserve moisture—the good kind. “[Hyaluronic acid] attracts and binds water; it is ideal to combine a hyaluronic acid serum and a moisturizer,” Dr. Howard says.\n“It is important to think of the order you apply your products,” she adds. When using skincare products, apply each formula from lightest to thickest consistency. “First, you would cleanse your face. Next, apply your hyaluronic acid serum and then follow with a moisturizer,” Dr. Howard explains.\n“Yes, you can use a hyaluronic acid serum daily. My advice is to take a look at the ingredient list of your other products as they may also be formulated with hyaluronic acid,” she says. Hyaluronic acid is a team player and pairs well with other humectants and actives.\nDr. Camille Howard, NYC-based dermatologist and founder of Girl+Hair\nNerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "The 8 Best Nail Trends From the Spring 2024 Runways", "date": "2023-10-06 21:35:00", "text": "Open this before your next nail appointment.  \nFeeling down? Need to juuz up your look a bit? Desiring a little self-care? You can never go wrong with a relaxing manicure. Personally, my eyes are always on the lookout for the latest nail trends as to prevent future me from wasting 20 minutes in the nail salon, perusing through Instagram for my next design (sorry to my nail artist). Whether you want some nail art inspiration or to simply know the latest nail color trends, the fashion week runways are like the crystal ball of trends.  And this season was no exception! On the  Spring/Summer ’24 runway, nail art focused on the feminine, drawing inspiration from the viral balletcore trend seen all over the runways. Classic styles, like the french manicure, got a modern update with chrome detailing and silver chrome nails, which are currently trending for Fall/Winter ’23 (you can thank Beyoncé and the Renaissance Tour), will continue to trend into the new year. Logomania was heavily trending in the pandemic era and now has popped up on nails and in a world full of stiletto and coffin lengths, this season, short nails reigned supreme. \nI caught up with Natalie Minerva, celebrity nail artist and OPI Global Ambassador, to talk all the Spring/Summer ’24 trends we loved on the fashion week runways. You don’t have to wait for the new year to discover the new trends (or even ask your Magic 8 ball). Keep reading to discover all the new trends, first! \n\n\nHelmut Lang played scrabble with nail art for Peter Do’s runway debut as the new Creative Director. A simple clear manicure spelled out H-E-L-M-U-T L-A-N-G in black font, a refreshing take from the logomania of past seasons. We have all the details, here.\nIf Scrabble isn’t quite your thing, go for the logo to spell out the love for your favorite brand. Celebrity nail artist Julie Kandalec hand painted the Kate Spade dot noel monogram on nails and gave the logomania trend an update by finishing it off with a black, skinny french design. \nSkinny jeans may be out, but skinny french manicures are in. A thin line turns this barely there manicure into Parisian chic.  \nRemember when colorful french manicures were the summer must-have nails? It applies to the skinny french trend, too! This red, skinny french manicure goes perfectly with a classic red lip. \nChrome nails are currently trending (thanks, Beyoncé) and do not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. “This trend will definitely dip into Spring/Summer—it’s applicable yar-round in my opinion,” says Minerva. \n“3D lined chrome French nails, like the ones we saw at Parabal Gurung, will be a big trend for Spring/Summer ’24,” shares Minerva. “We love a futuristic French,” she exclaims.\nBalletcore beauty gets an update at Mirror Palais with this pink, pearly chrome version. “Pink pearl is always a refreshing look that combines a nostalgic touch on a new modern classic,” says Minerva.\nIf pink is not your thing, you can still get into the balletcore trend by leaning into a pearly white or vanilla chrome look. \nNo manicure, no cry. At Michael Kors, Jin Soon Choi focused more on nail health, and gave models barely there manicures with light pink polish. \nProenza Schouler had models walk down the runway with short, clean, manicured nails. Mani minimalism at its finest!  \nNegative space will have a positive impact on manicure trends for Spring/Summer ’24 and is a fun way to have a minimalist manicure, but still play up design. “Simple lines and dots in black kept this manicure so simple and yet so impactful,” says Minerva.\n“For Spring Summer ’24, expect to see lots of shimmers that evoke a dreamy feeling like frosted chromes, baby pink shimmers, and sheer milky lavenders,” says Minerva. \nSaweetie once sang, “Ten white toes, I'm always tip top;” however, at Alice + Olivia, that monochromatic minimalist energy was invested in the nails. \nWhite nails were spotted on models at Libertine and is the perfect option for your clean girl aesthetic.  \nI will keep it short and sweet—go short and red for Spring 2024. Red nails are a classic and often showcased on long nails, but Proenza Schouler reminds us how great the color looks on short, manicured nails.\nClassic red nails always look sexy, no matter the nail length, as proven backstage at Brandon Maxwell. \nDanielle James is the Digital Beauty Director of ELLE.com.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nA sign to start shopping right now.\nThere’s something about Tory Burch. At least, that’s what I’ve been saying to myself and literally anyone else in the fashion realm for the past couple of seasons. While I’ve always been privy to the brand’s hold on fashion lovers everywhere, it seems to have a different type of effect on me as of late—and the fact that the Tory Burch spring/summer 2024 fashion show is still on top of mind should say it all. Perhaps the brand has been resonating with you in the same way—and if that’s the case, I have news for you: There are a ton of stylish pieces to start shopping before the Tory Burch Black Friday Sale arrives.\nI don’t want to believe it either, but Thanksgiving will be here before you know it, which means the days to shop the best Black Friday fashion deals are nigh (well, almost).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFor every aesthetic and budget. \nAs the temperature dips and pumpkin spice everything starts to take over, that’s typically a clear indication everyone’s favorite season is impending: gifting season. The nice list looks pretty long this year, meaning a trip to Ulta for the best beauty gifts is necessary. \nWhen it comes to buying presents for loved ones, Ulta’s the place where you can get just about anything for any loved one, whether they’re a frequent Tikok scroller,  a skin care newbie, or Mom, who’s still using the same fragrance you gifted her last year. \nThankfully, there isn’t a blush, hot tool, or fragrance ELLE editors aren’t already obsessed with. People want things they can use daily, and Ulta has an expansive selection of truly top-notch gifts that go beyond the ordinary. Whether you want to buy your lovable best friend the newest blush or your mother-in-law a new hair tool she’s been eyeing, or yourself a set of new brushes—you know, since it’s been a while since you last washed your current ones—Ulta is the place to shop for them all. Here, find the 16 best beauty gifts you can buy from Ulta this Holiday season. \nLibre Absolu Plastine is a tug-of-war between bright white florals and musky lavender that leans more masculine than its predecessors. With notes of orange blossom, white lavender accord, and diva lavender, this scent leaves the best first impression—on you and anyone you encounter. \nStyling your hair post-salon is a humbling experience. This Olaplex set provides a semi-professional routine using the brand’s best-selling staples—from a leave-in treatment to a serum to a finishing oil. \nWhy choose one when you can have it all? This set from Benefit contains three full-size mascaras and a mini size, so you can enjoy feathered-out lashes all year long.\nCoco and Eve’s kit allows you to fake a vacation a glow year-round with just two simple products. Pump the bronzing foam onto your mitt and brush the mixture wherever necessary. Easy peasy.\nBody oil is a great way to intensify the scent of your fragrance. This iteration from Chanel is the oil equivalent of the eau de parfum of the same name and features nourishing jojoba oil to keep your skin supple and smooth. \nWhether you hate washing your brushes or love to rotate a fresh new set every few months, this classic Real Techniques set covers all bases. There are two large fluffy brushes that are great for powders, and two smaller buffing brushes eyeshadow and concealers. \nEach perfume in Carolina Herrera’s Good Girl fragrance collection speaks to any mood you may be feeling. The new iteration comes just in time for spring and is packed with bright, romantic floral notes such as ylang-ylang, mandarin, rose water, and more. \nA skincare bundle is perhaps the best gift for someone looking to take their skin health seriously. Featuring Dermalogica bestsellers, this kit provides you with an entire routine—sans any sun protection—to enhance skin texture and health in just four steps. \nWhether your sartorial choices are stuck in the early aughts or the 90s, one thing synonymous with those eras is a good ol’ lip gloss. This one from Fenty Beauty looks to the 90s with its deep chocolate brown hue that pairs well with an even deeper lip liner.\nOnce you become a blush girl, there’s no going back. Dior’s TikTok-beloved bubble pink blush might initially seem intimidating, but the pink hue is easily buildable and can take you from a soft “clean girl” aesthetic to an intense rosy flush.\nIf you need the perfect pick-me-up, this palette is the ideal gift to help you feel powerful again. Plus, the shadows blend like butter and get you in the party mood no matter where you’re heading. \nI'll let you in on a secret: Ariana Grande’s Cloud perfume is one of ELLE readers’ favorite scents. It's sweet and youthful without feeling too childish. \nLeave dull skin in the past.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n’Tis the season for all puffer everything. \nOne day, it’s your laptop, books, and notepads. The next, it’s your groceries, and the day after that, your toiletries and a pair of shoes for that upcoming flight. My point is: You need a good tote bag for just about every and any occasion. It’s the most useful type of bag, but because it’s for all occasions, it should also be on-trend and comfortable—just versatile enough to work in every scenario. With all the hype around puffer styles right now, why not incorporate the quilted look into more than just a winter puffer jacket or vest with a chic puffer tote bag?\nNot only are these bags super practical and workable, but they are equally chic and cool. The style aligns with current fall 2023 bag trends, but can still be used as your work bag, weekender, or even gym bag. Here, find 15 puffer tote bags that are both cool and functional. \nThe customization and metallic finish on this tote elevate it perfectly. \nThink Royln is known for its puffers, and I am obsessed. This messenger tote is perfectly sized, and the crossbody strap makes it so comfortable. \nSustainable brand Baggu is saving the planet one bag at a time. This tote offers a slightly unique take on the puffer trend and is perfect for everything. It’s simple but has a great shape.\nI happen to own this bag, and it fits everything without weighing too much, no matter how much I stuff inside. It has a super chic feel, and the quilted puffer material is so chic—plus, it’s also a favorite of our senior shopping commerce editor.\nCoachtopia is the brand’s ultra-successful foray into trendier styles. The patch detailing here is cute, and the cloud-shaped stitching is unreal. \nThis COS bag is extremely on-trend. It’s technically an oversized tote bag, but it doesn’t feel too big when worn. It also looks super cool with any outfit.\nH&M is great at making affordable yet elevated styles that feel far more expensive. I would classify this bag as just that—price-conscious yet sophisticated.\nThis bag can fit way more than you’d think by the looks of it. Because of all the pockets, it is great for storing all the little things—and even a few big things.\nAnother trend we’ve been seeing lately of is mini bags. Although not quite mini, the strap on this is shorter than most other totes. The bag itself is plenty spacious, but the shorter handle makes it idea for transitioning from day-to-night.\nI love the stretchy, silky material on this bag, which differentiates it from other puffer totes. Plus, it’s really durable, so it will last the test of time.\nRain or shine, this bag is a must-have. It pairs perfectly with a matching puffer jacket in the fall and winter, and even shorts or a dress in the summer.\nEveryone loves a two-in-one option, and the bottom of this bag is expandable for days when you need the extra space.\nThe iconic North Face puffer jacket is now a bag of its own. I am definitely purchasing this and plan to pair it with the matching jacket for a coordinated ensemble.\nLeave it to Alo Yoga to make the most necessary tote of all. For anyone who needs a perfectly sized bag to carry wet, worn, or dirty items, this is it. \nOf course you can find the perfect puffer on Amazon. Doesn’t this one look like a marshmallow?\nIsabelle Adler is a contributor at ELLE.com.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nELLE's favorite beauty releases of the new season, featuring all sorts of metals. \nRecently, I’ve been getting asked the same questions anytime I'm at a dinner party. The first, what do I think of Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner? The second is more in reference to my job: What beauty products have I seen recently that have really excited me? Well, let me direct them here: To a selection of new Fall beauty launches that are making me feel like it's back-to-school season all over again, and they all happen to have a glint of metals, whether it be in the packaging or the formula itself. Read on for the sparkle explosion coming from Rabanne Beauty, two beautiful new palettes inspired by art, and a royal scent with actual 24-karat-gold.\n“Chanel’s famous skin care line now comes in refillable packaging, with a gold-anodized aluminum core. The refill vessel is also pretty enough to stand on its own (and great for travel).”— Kathleen Hou, Beauty Director\n“This gua sha massage tool is shaped like the fan-shaped leaves of the ginkgo, one of nature’s most mystical trees. I like using the smooth end for lifting, and the curved end for de-puffing, especially when I use it with the Supremÿa Baume, newly reformulated to be even more luxurious and potent.”— K.H.\n“Anybody who loves a head massage needs this comb. Its eight teeth gently stimulate your scalp for better circulation (which may lead to stronger hair growth). It’s made of kansa, a sacred Ayurvedic material that’s naturally antimicrobial.”— Margaux Anbouba, Beauty Editor\nRabanne Beauty leans hard into the ’60s metallic heritage of the fashion brand, with glitter in all-new, extra-shiny forms: glitter spray that makes you look like you were doused with pixie dust; a concentrated loose powder that turns metallic and can be dabbed everywhere; and even a sparkly mascara topcoat. For something a little more subtle, there are eye shadow palettes in rich shades and extra-smooth formulas and an inky black mascara. — K.H.\n“This concealer has medium coverage and a silky formula that’s spiked with hyaluronic acid to hydrate. It lasts all day, so you can look fresh from your morning coffee to evening cleanser.”— M.A.\n“Yes, those are flecks of 24-karat gold inside this fragrance. Inspired by Louis XIV’s beloved orange trees in his parterre garden, fresh neroli blossoms mix with firewood smoke and pomegranate, paying homage to the lively parties that the Sun King threw inside his Orangery.”— M.A.\n“My favorite smoky eye becomes much more artful when using this palette. Each of the shades was inspired by Lancôme makeup creative director Lisa Eldridge’s private tour of the Louvre, where she saw light dancing across the marble statues and artwork of the Richelieu wing.”— M.A.\n“Dior’s new serum has a dramatic backstory: On one day, for just one hour, a special variety of wild rose bred specifically for skin care is harvested, frozen at below-zero temperatures, and then cryo-ground to become the hero ingredient.”— K.H.\n“A new-ish Australian beauty brand committed to ‘slow beauty,’ Fluff does small-batch quarterly drops of its products, which have included a bronzer powder and a solid lip oil. I particularly like the Anish Kapoor–style design of Fluff’s refillable compacts.”— K.H.\nComing Soon\n\"If you’ve always been a vanilla girl and grew up on the scent of Bath & Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar, there’s a grown-up version for you. This scent features a trio of vanillas, including a vanilla infusion, a vanilla absolute, and a vanilla caviar. If you’re looking for a scent like straight vanilla extract, this isn’t it because it doesn’t smell overpoweringly sweet, thanks to some lavendar and woods notes. But it does smell warm and a little edible all at the same time.\"— K.H.\n\"Jean-Claude Ellena, the former master perfume for  Hermès is famous for saying that perfumes should be like a \"soft caress,\" and should not shout. His latest creation isn't any less distinctive though, and is for those who love warm, spicy scents. Fall often means that people begin rotating in their favorite smoky scents. But if you're not a fan of the woodsy scent family, this, with its notes of clove, ambrette, and carrot seed, is a great alternative \"sweater scent.\"  — K.H.\n“With my sensitive dry skin, this is just what I needed. The gel-cream formula melts into to the skin to revive and rehydrate for a smooth, dewy finish. The cream also offers an incredible sounding 100-hours of moisture as a claim, so I'm thinking that it should last me all day.” —Tasha Nicole Smith, Beauty Assistant\n“Gabriela Hearst has released her very first perfume set, created with Argentinian fragrance brand Fueguia. The scent Paysandú features native ingredients never before used in perfumery, such as the medicinal plant marcela and herb carqueja, to conjure up a floral and smoky picture of rural Uruguay, where Hearst and Fueguia founder Julian Bedel both grew up.”— K.H.\n“Gabriela Heart's New York is a ‘big city’ scent, with notes of smoke and bourbon. Together, with Paysandú, they create an aromatic synergy for the designer, who still runs her family’s ranch in Uruguay.”— K.H.\n“After interviewing multiple perfumers, I’ve learned that the key to smelling completely unique is to layer fragrances. It’s sort of like it is with clothes. Wearing an outfit straight off the runway is one thing, but combining a few of your well-loved pieces to create your own distinctive look really makes it personal.  Designer Tory Burch agrees, telling me that, 'Growing up, I always loved mixing and layering scents to create something new.' These oils with their soft singular notes like rose, vetiver, and sandalwood, are like a great basic, and the perfect fragrance wardrobe staple to build your own personal scent from.” — K.H.\nWhat to Buy From Glossier’s Black Friday Sale\nThe Best Hyaluronic Acid Serums for Radiant Skin \nKate Moss Stars in New Charlotte Tilbury Campaign\nBigger Than Botox: The Newest Beauty Game Changer\nThe Unifying Power of Latina Beauty\nChristian Cowan Has Something New For Your Face\nThe Best Spring 2024 Makeup Trends \nEverything You Need to Know About Lash Lifts\nOur 20 Favorite Fragrances of All Time\n25 Best Ulta Products According to ELLE Editors\nThe 13 Best Root Touch-Up Products\n15 Best Drugstore Retinol Staples That Really Work\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "13 At-Home Laser Hair Removal Devices That Actually Work", "date": "2023-10-03 21:50:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFlawless skin with just one zap.\nWhile you might be feeling down about the end of summer, the fall and winter seasons are the perfect time to finally test out some of the best at-home laser hair removal tools. Even though the convenience of using your favorite razor in the shower is an excellent option for hair removal, it can be tedious, result in ingrown hairs, and become an exhausting process if what you’re after is skin as smooth as a baby seal. If you’re anything like me, using an at-home hair removal device is equally thrilling and terrifying. I find shaving tedious, but my first foray into permanent hair removal didn’t go well. After spending hundreds of dollars at an esthetician’s office, I found laser hair removal was not effective enough to justify the pain. Because I’m someone who can easily cosplay as Snow White (pale skin, dark hair, high tolerance for short men), I’m the ideal candidate for laser hair removal. But alas, I had to give it up for the sake of my sanity and my wallet.\nI thought I was resigned to using a razor forever. Then, I stumbled upon the Braun IPL Silk Expert Pro device. Not only was it significantly cheaper, less painful, and less humiliating than the salon service, but I actually started to see results quickly. For all of the many methods of body-hair removal out there—from shaving with the best razors to sugaring to waxing—laser hair removal (both professional and at home) is the only strategy that promises more permanent results. \nAt-home handheld hair removal devices come in two categories: IPL or a diode laser. Most at-home laser hair removal devices rely on IPL—intense pulsated light—therapy, in which tiny beams of light at different wavelengths zap the bulb within each hair follicle. “In essence, it is using heat to destroy the hair follicles,” says dermatologist Dr. Marisa K. Garshick, who mentions that dermatologists also use versions of IPL for photo rejuvenation procedures (a.k.a. fading dark spots). On the flip side, diode laser technology uses one single wavelength of light, which experts say can help minimize damage to the surrounding skin and be used safely on all skin types and shades. The light is selectively absorbed by the pigment, or melanin, within the hair follicle, making it a more targeted (and often more effective) approach to hair removal. \nAccording to dermatologist Dr. Karan Lal, it’s important to note that most at-home devices are “best suited for small to medium hairs in small areas—upper lip, chin, cheeks, bikini, etc.,” he says. “They are typically not meant for large surface areas like the back.” (There are a few exceptions, but we’ll get to that later).\nTo help you wade through the treacherous waters of the World Wide Web, we consulted our experts and customer reviews to find the 13 best at-home laser hair removal devices for women. \nFeaturing a sensor that adapts the light intensity to your skin tone, this FDA-approved device strikes the perfect balance between safety and efficacy. For sensitive skin, there are also three “comfort modes” to choose from: normal, gentle, or extra gentle. The device comes with two interchangeable heads for more precise results in different areas like the face, armpits, and bikini line. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’m eight weeks in and it has worked even better than I’d hoped. Other than a few stray hairs, my legs are completely hairless, and I have no need to shave between treatments.”\nAccording to some reviewers, this device is best suited for those with very dark and/or coarse hair. It’s equipped with an LED screen to track how many light pulses have beamed onto each area—though you may need to wear safety goggles (which are included) while operating. Each lamp comes programmed with enough pulses to last for up to five years. When it runs out, you can order a replacement cartridge and keep the handle.\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “If you’re a female with the unfortunate gift of facial hair, do not hesitate—buy this one! I have fair skin and thick black hairs, which make me a great candidate. I’m on my sixth treatment, and my chin hairs are growing back finer and slower. I’ve also used this on my armpits with great success.”\nIn a perfect world, most at-home laser hair removal devices would be equipped to be used forever and ever. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly the case, but this device comes pretty close. Fitted with 600,000 flashes, which equals about 40-plus years of full-body treatments, you can bet this tool will be in for the long haul.\nBest for: Fair to dark complexions\nHair color: Black and brown hair\nNood rating: 4.7/5 stars\nA Nood reviewer says: “The flasher is easy to use and I am already starting to see results in the first four weeks! Cannot wait to see what it does in the next four weeks!”\nSee results in as little as three to four weeks with this handheld-sized option. Equipped with five power settings, this device is safe to go all over various skin tones and sensitive areas (yep, even down there!) easily. Uniquely, the head of the device offers cooling properties to reduce laser heat on the skin. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light blonde hair\nKENZZI rating: 5/5 stars\nA KENZZI reviewer says: “A worthwhile investment; it works! After five sessions, I am seeing notable results. Hair growth is very, very minimal. Absolutely fantastic.”\nThis FDA-approved laser also includes Braun’s smart skin sensor, which automatically adapts your treatment to your skin tone to ensure a safe and effective treatment. Equipped with 300,000 flashes for longevity, the device is small enough for trickier areas (and is safe for facial use!) while covering enough skin so the process doesn’t take forever.\nBest for: Fair to dark complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 4.3/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve been using this about twice a week for a little over a month, and I would say the hair in my pits is 80 to 90 percent gone. And most impressively, it doesn’t hurt!”\nThis sapphire device might look too pretty to use, but trust me, you’ll become obsessed with the results. Unlike some devices which can burn the skin, this tool has a significantly cooler head, making it more comfortable to use. If you don’t have a high pain tolerance, this tool is practically painless to use.\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I never write reviews, but feel like I have to for this device. I began using it immediately on my upper lip, chin, and armpits. I have not had to pluck a single chin hair since I started using it over a month ago. The armpit hair growth has substantially decreased as well. I am approximately seven sessions in, and I cannot speak highly enough of this device.”\nThis compact, lightweight, FDA-approved device is the most time-efficient option out there. The device itself is corded, so keep that in mind. However, as its title suggests, you simply press the button where you want to laser for a quick treatment. Plus, it’s safe to use on your face!\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Yes, this really works. I have very light skin with dark hair. I started using this every three days and my bikini line and upper lip hairs are now pretty much non-existent.”\nIf you’re looking for an FDA-approved device to treat larger areas like your legs, arms, or back, the head of this laser is large enough to cover more ground. The laser emitted is a brand-patented combination of IPL and radiofrequency designed to safely treat a broader range of skin tones and hair colors. The scientists behind the professional machines actually developed the technology, so you know you’re in good hands.\nBest for: All skin tones\nHair color: All hair colors\nNordstrom rating: 4/5 stars\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “I️ had modest expectations, but this product definitely went above and beyond. I️ have black hair and mainly used it to reduce the peach fuzz on my abdominal area.”\nIf your pain tolerance is somewhat low, you may want to reach for this device with cooling technology that reduces laser heat and inflammation. What’s more, it has three other attachments and is rechargeable. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “It worked like magic. You need to be consistent though, but it works.”\nIf you’re in the market for something that won’t break the bank but will still get those silky hair-free legs you’ve been dreaming about, look no further. This model features two modes and eight adjustable light settings to ensure pain-free removal. Even better, you get a three-year warranty. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Light brown to black hair\nAmazon rating: 3.6/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “I didn’t really expect this little device to do such a good job, but it does. I would normally need to shave every three days, and now I don’t have stubble for nearly a week. Plus, my skin feels really smooth.”\nFor your next international getaway or domestic weekend trip, you might want to start thinking about what you want to bring in your makeup bag. This FDA-approved device can easily fit in any toiletry case and still packs a punch with its 300,000 flashes. In fact, it’s designed to reveal smooth skin in just 15 minutes. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.1/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “Quite simple to use, doesn’t burn, and isn’t painful. It is small and can be carried in your luggage, so you do not have to stop the treatments.”\nIt’s no secret that laser hair removal can be uncomfortable at times. Here's an option that is borderline pain-free. The laser on this machine feels more like an ice cube to the skin, which helps minimize pain and soothe the skin. It’s got two modes for large and small areas and five energy levels to adapt to different hair densities and skin sensitivities. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.6/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “I was so surprised this actually worked, but it did! The hair I treated has either grown back more slowly and is sparse or hasn’t come back at all. I’ve used it every other week for the past three months. More than got my money’s worth.”\nUnlike many at-home IPL devices, this one is suitable for several skin types and hair colors, and, according to reviewers, it’s also a gentler option than many others on the market. The device itself isn’t rechargeable or corded; it comes pre-charged with 400,000 light pulses, which the company claims will last a “lifetime.”\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.5/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “This product does work! It may not work as well as the professional treatments, but with patience, the cost benefit and easy access make treating yourself at home well worth it.”\nDr. Marisa K. Garshick is a dermatologist practicing with MCDS Dermatology in New York and New Jersey.\nDr. Karan Lal is a dermatologist and director of pediatric dermatology and cosmetic surgery at Affiliated Dermatology in Scottsdale, Arizona. \n“Both IPL and diode devices rely on the same target, which is the pigment of the hair follicle, to have an effect,” Dr. Garshick says. She adds, “At the most basic level, the diode refers to an actual laser, while the IPL is a light-based device.”With a bit of consistency and a lot of patience whichever light beam route you opt for will come with real results. Typically, it will take at least a few sessions to see any change, and each session should be spaced out at least one week apart. Remember always to follow the instructions of your specific device.\nDepending on the intensity level of the laser (many of the devices have multiple settings), it can feel uncomfortable. When each follicle gets zapped, it might sting a bit—many people compare it to a rubber band being snapped on the skin.

The e-tailer’s Prime Day event happened in July, but get ready for the fall version—Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days. It’s a bit of a mouthful, but it’s sure to be worth it. The two-day savings fest is slated for October 10 and October 11, which is coming up fast (in other words, set your alarms). You’ll be able to save big on everything from tech goodies and jewelry to pantry staples and shapewear, but some of the best gems to be had are in none other than the fashion department. Lucky you. \nWhether it’s Hailey Bieber’s favorite Alo yoga leggings or a handbag that’s going viral on TikTok, this is your chance to both refresh your wardrobe and stock up on basics.

Scroll through below to shop the best sale items from the fashion section—including amazingly comfortable cloud slides—on Amazon now.\nI keep a pretty minimal wardrobe (for a fashion editor), but the one thing I’ll never closet purge is my collection of white T-shirts. \nThe ultimate fall sweater for all your festive activities. Plus, there’s a bit of cashmere in here!\nYou can find me living in these all winter. Oh and P.S., these are available in plus sizes.  \nSergio Hudson at 80 percent off? I’ll race you to the checkout. \nThese might just be the perfect fall boots. \nThese are a favorite of ELLE’s digital deputy editor Claire Stern, who says they are some of the comfiest heels.  \nThis three-piece luggage set is a steal if I’ve ever seen one. \nAlthough it pains me to admit, puffer jacket weather is indeed on its way. \nThick, buttery leggings with pockets are the only kind worth wearing, IMO.\nLooking for the best Amazon Prime Day cloud slide deals? Amazon has tons of options available—starting with these super-affordable (and bestselling) options. Perfect for first-timers and pillow-shoe vets alike.\nI could ramble on about wide-leg jeans forever, but I’ll let these do the talking instead.\nTravel light by carrying just the necessities with this practical wristlet-crossbody combo.\nMaybe you can’t get your hands on the eternally sold-out Birkenstock Boston clogs, but you can get a great deal on this lookalike.\nGive me all the Levi’s, always—especially considering the brand has Bella Hadid’s stamp of approval.\nWhere do all the claw clips go? They seem to have a knack for disappearing. Stock up on some of these fan favorites. \nDon’t these look like they cost at least $400?

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nYou’re looking snatched and fiscally responsible.  \nI know it feels like Amazon Prime Day was just here, but it’s nearly time for the fall savings event, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days—mark your calendars for October 10 and October 11. There are bound to be more marked-down items than one person could possibly parse through, so we’re breaking down all the best goodies to shop during the sale, like the best jewelry deals, home deals, and even the best Amazon Halloween costumes. But for now, it’s all about the best shapewear deals. \nI am a big proponent of shapewear. The right piece can solve undergarment conundrums, boost confidence, and amplify looks. But it often does so at a hefty price tag. Is this capitalism preying on our insecurities? Probably, but you don’t have to stand for it any longer because Amazon carries tons of options at affordable price points. From butt-lifting shorts to full slip dresses, you can shop for whatever it is you need. Better yet, you can look to customer reviews and photos to help inform your decisions. But if you want to make the most of the Big Deal Days, you better get a head start. Here, preview some of the best shapewear on Amazon to add to your cart ahead of the savings event. \nA thong bodysuit like this is perfect for wearing under just about anything—including jeans and a T-shirt. \nThese are the No. 1 bestseller on Amazon for a good reason. Smooth yourself out from the waist to mid-thigh with these shorts. \nI love that this has shorts because it will also help prevent chafing if worn under a dress or skirt. \nWearing a tight dress on a girl’s night out calls for a shaping thong. \nDon’t forget that Spanx is available to shop on Amazon. Stock up on all your favorites during the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days. \nHere’s another mid-thigh option, but this one is strapless, which makes it even more versatile. \nAll shapewear should have a built-in bra, IMHO. But anti-static? A new bar has been set. \nFeel snug and secure under any formal gown (or casual maxi dress!) with this longline slip. \nWhile this is both stomach smoothing and booty lifting, my favorite part is the silky smooth fabric. \nYou shouldn’t have to choose between risqué necklines or shapewear. Opt for an open-chested shaper and get the best of both worlds.\nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nYou can never have too many handbags.\nWhether you carry exclusively designer handbags or are a thrift store queen, your purse says a lot about you. Just like any other accessory, it has the potential to be not just a functional piece, but a statement-maker, a conversation starter. With the right bag (and the right contents), you can go anywhere. Gucci, Fendi, and Prada are of course everyone’s dream bags, but what I love about smaller popular purse brands is that they’re typically less ubiquitous. You get the thrill of someone asking, “Where’d you get that bag?” Whoever and wherever you are, that never gets old. \nSome might say you can have too many bags, but the other perk about small purse brands is that they’re typically more affordable than the big designers. So, you can buy however many you want. Step up your purse game—and get into the best fall 2024 bag trends, while you’re at it—and check out these brands, both popular and upcoming, to know right now.\nYou might’ve seen Published By’s sculptural metallic handbags around Instagram, but they’re more than a one-trick brand. Its styles can be worn as statement pieces or as everyday bags, and both ways are bound to garner plenty of compliments.\nPrice range: $350-$1,000\nNon-traditional shoe brand and queer-community favorite SYRO is now venturing into handbags, and you’ll definitely want to get your feet— wait, hands—on this one. Inspired by a trans woman who subdued the Club Q attacker by stomping on him with her heels, this bag is made to be not just a handbag, but protection. Not only is it a uniquely chic bag perfect for clubbing, commuting, and everything in between, but the story behind it makes it totally badass. Get on the pre-order list ASAP!\nPrice range: $375\nMedea is just the kind of subtle, underrated brand that any cool girl needs to have in her stash. The brand’s signature is bags that could pass for shopping bags, but they’re also known to drop must-have new releases like its just-released jeans bag.\nPrice range: €300-€1,100\nIf you saw Bottega Veneta’s latest runway show, you’ll know that the bandana-shaped bag will be the next big shape, but it’s nothing new. Lemaire’s bandana bag is perfect for holding everything you could want while maintaining it’s cool, slouchy shape.\nPrice range: $965-$2,200\nDentro’s bags are great if you want a distressed look without the distressed quality. Spare threads and exposed lining are staples of the brand and make for a uniquely chic look.\nPrice range: $390-$850\nCoach is perhaps one of the penultimate bag brands, but its new line of Coachtopia bags, made with sustainable materials, gives a youthful boost to the brand’s ethos. \nPrice range: $195-$550\nKARA is a great brand for cool statement bags. From oversized chain handles to all-over knots, these designs make for perfect bags to carry on a night out. \nPrice range: $325-$750\nPuppets & Puppets wasn’t always known for their bags, but recent collections have made them a must-have for ironic accessories. You might’ve seen the brand’s popular cookie bags in various colors, but we particularly love its banana handle bag.\nPrice range: $395-$645\nDemellier London makes bags that are sleek and sophisticated, proving you don’t need a designer logo to prove the quality. Made with high-quality sheepskin leather, the styles are smooth, smocked, croc-embossed, or quilted, making for a variety of chic styles that can be worn anywhere.\nPrice range: $450-$695\nW78st uses upcycled materials to make its ultra-cushiony purses, including denim, leather, and special charms. They also come in a range of sizes, from ultra-mini to oversized statement bags.\nPrice range: $420-$570\nYou may know Brahmin as a classic brand for croc-embossed and leather handbags, but the brand’s latest designs and colorways make the brand youthful and fun. They have any color you could possibly want, but if you want to stick to black and brown, they have plenty of chic styles for that, as well.\nPrice range: $95-$435\nKaai’s styles range from mini bags to large leather totes, which means you can get any style you need. With subtle design and minimal logos, these bags make quiet luxury accessible.\nPrice range: $215-$800\nBrandon Blackwood handbags have been popular since they first launched, and there’s a reason. The shapes, colorways, and materials are trendy but high-quality, and the brand name is quickly becoming a designer brand in its own right.\nPrice range: $175-$550\nBoyy’s special wonton-shaped bags are not only cute and dainty, but ultra-chic too. The brand carries a wide variety of styles, including its signature buckle styles, and you’ll get a wide range of colorways as well, all in high-quality materials like calf-leather or nylon.\nPrice range: $595-$1,700\nYou may know Alexis Bittar for bold, statement jewelry, but it’s time to get to know the brand’s purses as well. Made with the same craftsmanship and metalwork as the brand’s jewelry, why not level up your purse game, too?\nPrice range: $395-$745\nDouglas Poon’s glass bags have been a favorite of mine for a while. The unique, Victorian aesthetic of the bags is rather impractical, but that’s the beauty of them. These are definitely conversation-starter bags, just be super careful with them!\nPrice range: $250-$530\nBembien handbags have the quality of vintage leather bags, but the luxury of modern design. They’re perfect for everyday use, whether you’re trekking around the city or going on vacation.\nPrice range: $175-$390\nTalk about a two-in-one: Edie Parker’s signature Burn Bags also feature a connected lighter, so you’ll never be without one on a night out (or a morning journey home). \nPrice range: $295-$895\nThe 40 Best-Reviewed Workout Clothes on Amazon\n11 Indigenous Designers to Support Now\nThe Best Deals at Tory Burch’s Black Friday Sale\n15 Cute Puffer Totes to Shop ASAP\nThe Launch: Fashion News to Know This October\nThe Best Bags to Buy During Amazon’s Big Deal Days\nThe Best Amazon Fashion Deals to Shop Right Now\nShop These Deals on Amazon Shapewear \nThe 49 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon \n12 Best Ballet Flats With Arch Support\nA Hot Girl’s Guide to Amazon Halloween Costumes\n14 Jewelry Deals From Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "12 Ballet Flats With Real Arch Support, According to an Expert Who’s ‘En Pointe’", "date": "2023-10-03 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nWear this season’s most popular styles in complete comfort.\nAll of my prima ballerinas out there know too well that those pink satin dancing shoes fall far from the realm of comfort. Consequentially, their watered-down, functional fashion counterpart, the ballet flat, doesn’t exactly provide much in the way of relief or reinforcement, either. So while the concept of ballet flats with arch support may seem contradictory, rest assured that you can still wear one of this season’s hottest fall shoe trends without totally compromising comfort.\nAnd who better to pirouette-turn to than Dr. Ann Anderson, podiatrist and podiatric surgeon with a background in ballet? “A ballet flat will not usually give as much arch support as a sneaker,” she admits. “But [they] can be supportive if the construction of the shoe incorporates an arch support...” Despite the name, a “flat” shoe can still offer adequate support if it’s intentionally designed. \nThankfully, certain brands have mastered the art of comfortable ballet flats. Anderson suggests looking for a heel cup or arch support that is part of the shoe design in order to help support your foot overall. Below, shop the 12 best ballet flats with arch support to wear this season.\nIn all likelihood, you’ve already seen Vivaia flats trending across social media, touting extreme comfort and earth-friendly composition. Complete with an Armisia Argy herbal insole, the Aria 5°  provides promising heel rebound, arch and forefront support, and a padded  heel patch for extra cushy comfort. This style is also machine-washable, making it a champion of convenience as well.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: 31 options\nMaterial: Recycled cardboard, carbon-free rubber\nCustomer review: “Vivaia’s shoes are made from recycled plastic bottles, which is what originally got me interested in the brand. I think we can all agree, 6 plastic bottles never looked this good...the first thing I noticed was the insole; these are now more cushioned and structured around the arches and toes.”\nA style I’m most looking forward to wearing this season, the Mary Jane makes a case for comfort with this square-toed, patent pair of flats from Cole Haan. An easy accomplice for fall denim or cozy sweater dresses, this shoe is lightweight and comes equipped with additional arch support. \nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Black/Gold, Lizard Gold\nMaterial: Synthetic, polyurethane\nCustomer review: “I wanted simple flats that weren’t boring. I wore them for the first time to a wedding. 10 hours, standing at least half of that time, plus dancing, and they were completely comfortable (and I have flat feet).” \nIf you only add one shoe to your closet this year, make it a ruby red slipper. This one from Margaux has a 4.8-star rating from nearly 850 reviews, most of which praise the shoe’s plush, customizable fit and multi-width sizing. And if you need even more support, Anderson suggests adding a custom molded orthotic prescribed by a podiatrist—as over-the-counter options can sometimes be too bulky or thick.\nSizes: 3-14\nColors: 15 options\nMaterial: Nappa leather\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “A problem I have with most flats is that they’re a little too flat. I’ve had more success with Margaux flats than other brands because they have a little cushioning inside.”\nDesigned in nude shades and natural palettes, Rebecca Allen’s patent flat features breathable lining and a foam-cushioned footbed for squishy-soft support. Side note: If you have a wider foot, you may want to size up in these, given the pointed toe.\nSizes: 6-11\nColors: Black, Nude I, Nude II, Nude III, Nude IV\nMaterial: Leather\nCustomer review: “I own two pairs and absolutely love them and get so many compliments! I’ve never had a pair of flats/skims that don’t slip in my heel when walking UNTIL these!”\nA lovechild of the classic ballet flat and timeless loafer, this airy flat comes with a molded EVA insole and a memory foam midsole. It’s also available in multiple widths, so it’s great for those with particularly wide or narrow feet.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Black, Silver Metallic, Beige, Navy\nMaterial: Leather, fabric, synthetic\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “These shoes appealed to me straight away. They’re classic and comfortable. Dressed up or casual, I just love them.”\nNot only do these classic ballerinas add an unexpected pop of pastel to your fall wardrobe, but they also cradle your feet in molded, shock-absorbing EVA foam.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Jade, Natural Beige\nMaterial: Synthetic, microfiber\nCustomer review: “LOVE the jade green color!”\nIf you’re looking to add a little bedazzle and pizzazz to your everyday black-on-black ensemble, these flats from Birdies proudly display a subtle jacquard pattern and bejeweled strap, alongside seven layers of “cloud-like comfort” in the footbed.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: 15 options\nMaterial: Jacquard, rubber\nCustomer review: “Super cute and comfortable flats! Felt a little snug at first, but fit well after wearing around the house for a little bit. Perfect addition to my workwear wardrobe!”\nAnderson lists Vionic as one of her favorite brands when it comes to comfort and support. Vionic prides itself on podiatrist-approved options, no matter the style. So rest assured that this cute, orthotic ballet flat hosts top-tier technology meant to hug your arches and support natural alignment. And if you’re still not sold, this style also received the American Pediatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Navy, Gold, Pewter, Silver, Black\nMaterial: Leather or calf hair, microfiber, rubber\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “These are a dream come true! I have avoided wearing ballet flats for years because they usually lacked arch support. Vionic for the win...now I can wear them with full support for all day comfort!”\nThese charming, feminine flats have a removable PORON®-cushioned insole that focuses on offering maximum arch support. \nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Navy, Camel, Leopard, Black/White\nMaterial: Polyester, leather\nCustomer review: “These are incredibly comfortable. I wore them the first day for 10+ hours and no blisters!”\nThe classic black flat gets a sleek update in the form of this pointed-toe cutout style. Not only can you wear these with practically everything, but you’ll also be relieved to know they’re built with contour and comfort technology, so you can wear them (painlessly) all day long.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Black, Hazelnut, Silver\nMaterial: Synthetic\nWidths: Standard, Wide\nCustomer review: “Cute, dressy flat. Fits true to size, rubs slightly on my heel...but they are great for dressing up an outfit.”\nThese houndstooth slingback flats bring sophisticated details to a classic style—like a side cutout, oversized buckle, and a cushioned footbed with arch support. Perfect for pairing with your favorite sweater and neutral slacks.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Black Houndstooth, Tobacco, Brown, Black\nMaterial: Leather, synthetic, rubber\nCustomer review: “These shoes are beautiful! True to size fit and well made. I had read some reviews that said these shoes run small...this is not my experience. I may get another pair!”\nFitFlop burst onto the footwear scene in 2007 when they introduced biomechanically engineered sandals designed to complement “body structure, joint alignment and natural movement,” while still being non-ugly, of course. A hefty feat indeed, but they’ve overwhelmingly succeeded and expanded their footwear styles to include sneakers, boots, and flats—like this one with almost 300 5-star Amazon reviews.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: 19 options\nMaterial: Leather, fabric, rubber\nCustomer review: “These were perfect...they fit so well they feel like slippers, especially with the subtly padded insole & cushioned outsole...they look like flats but have nice arch support.”\nTypically, actual ballet dancers have notoriously high arches in their feet. But arch support-specific shoes are usually best for lower arch, or flatter, feet. \n“Higher arch feet usually need more cushioning in the shoes for shock absorption than arch support, so I usually do not recommend an arch support shoe for these patients,” Anderson says. Whether your arches are high or low, you should always consult your doctor before ditching all your shoes for orthotics. If your feet are too flat, arch support can cause pesky callouses from excessive pressure along the arch. In this case, it’s best to seek out a custom orthotic that fits your shoes. \n“Ballet can be very hard on your feet,” Anderson notes, due to years of stretching and strengthening the midsole to stand on pointe. But ballet flats in general are “not considered a supportive shoe because they lack significant shoe structure, they have a narrow toe-box, and have no support for the foot,” she states. And a super thin flat with no support can make you feel like your feet are literally pounding the pavement all day long.\nTo counteract this, Anderson advises looking for flats that specifically tout arch support or a heel cup, and a wider toe-box to allow for more wiggle room in the shoes. However, if you do have severe podiatric woes, you may want to wear the style carefully. “I will caution that ballet flats are usually not as deep as other shoes, and this can lead to nail injury due to excessive pressure on the nails,” Anderson warns.\n15 Cute Puffer Totes to Shop ASAP\nThe Best Bags to Buy During Amazon’s Big Deals Day\nThe Best Amazon Fashion Deals to Shop Right Now\nShop These Deals on Amazon Shapewear \nThe 49 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon \nKeep These 18 Best Purse Brands on Your Radar Now\nA Hot Girl’s Guide to Amazon Halloween Costumes\n14 Jewelry Deals From Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days\n25 Suede Bags to Carry You Through The Fall Season\nThe Early Black Friday Fashion Sales to Shop Now\nShop Brands That Support Breast Cancer Awareness\nThe Launch: Fashion News to Know This September\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFor when you need a bit of arm candy. \nWhile the rest of the world is mourning the departure of sunny weather and 9 p.m. sunsets, fashion aficionados are rejoicing over the arrival of fall—the ultimate season to cocoon ourselves in scarves, stomp around in our favorite boots, and show off all of the sweaters that have been piling up in our closets. ’Tis the season to layer and accessorize, and there are few pieces we love as much as a gorgeous handbag. \nWhere summer was all about canvas bags and straw totes fit for a picnic in the park or a day at the beach, fall assemblages call for a bit more repose and sophistication.

{"title": "The 25 Best ‘Sex and the City’ Guest Stars", "date": "2023-10-01 04:00:00", "text": "I couldn't help but wonder, who hasn't been on SATC?\nFor six seasons, Sex and the City was a revolving door for actors and actresses who were either fans of the show, friends of the show, or up-and-comers who just wanted to be part of the action. Some played versions of themselves (Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu), while others were barely recognizable (a young Kat Dennings, Andy Cohen). Here, a look back at some of the famous faces who crossed paths with Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte over the years.\nAll episodes are available to stream on Max\nJack (Bradley Cooper) was bad news from the beginning. As Carrie says in the episode, \"They Shoot Single People, Don't They?\" Jack was everything she needed at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday at a gay bar: single, straight, smoker. It could've been the greasy hair, the tempting smoking habit (she was trying really hard to quit), or the fact that Jack later discovered Carrie's \"Single & Fabulous?\" New York Magazine cover story — the two never did anything more than make out in a crowded bar and briefly, in his convertible. \nIn “The Perfect Present,” Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda head to a purse party thrown by the recently dumped Vanessa, played by the queen of the bend-and-snap. “Isn’t life funny? Because of that fucker, I’ve discovered, I’m Fendi!” she says in the episode, moments before walking into Samantha and Smith (in his pre-Gus Van Sant days) boning against several glass racks. \nGeri Halliwell played Phoebe, someone Samantha runs into on one of the hottest days of the summer. While fanning herself, Samantha learns (via Phoebe) that the pool at Soho House is the place to be, that is, if you can get past the waiting list. Enter: Annabelle Bronstein, whose membership card Samantha finds in the bathroom and uses a few times before her jig is up.\nBetween the end of The X-Files (the OG run) and the beginning of Californication, David Duchovny guest starred on several TV shows including Sex and the City. He played Jeremy, Carrie’s high school boyfriend (sorry, \"sweetheart\") who completely sweeps her off her feet before revealing he’s starting treatment at a mental institution in Connecticut. Here he is welcoming Carrie to the Juneau Spears Center, a place harder to get into (and out) of than the Soho House.\nJustin Theroux had the distinct honor of guest starring on SATC twice. On the season one episode, “The Monogamists,” Justin played Jared, a writer friend of Stanford’s who had a thing for giving the thumbs-up and was named one of  New York Magazine’s “30 Coolest People Under 30.” His character didn’t venture too far in the occupation department the second time around; on the season two episode “Shortcomings,” Justin played Vaughn, a fiction writer who orgasms too fast (hence, the episode’s title). \nIn the same episode where Samantha famously said, “I don’t believe in the Republican party or the Democratic party; I believe in parties,” Elizabeth Banks checked off one of her very first TV roles. In “Politically Erect,” Elizabeth played Catherine, the pearl-wearing fiancée of a politician Charlotte had set her eyes on at a fundraiser. According to Catherine, she met Bob, the fiancée, at a party where women brought guys they didn't want to date, leading a martini-filled Charlotte to mumble something about one women's trash becoming another's treasure.\nJohn Slattery played politician Bill Kelley, who was running for city treasurer and famously told Carrie, \"I love making love with you,\" before asking her to pee on him in the shower. When Carrie offered to \"dribble warm tea\" on him instead, Bill dumped her, citing that his campaign advisors didn't like her sex column. This of course, led Carrie to write a bit called, \"To Pee or Not To Pee?\" without using his real name. \"It was much more political not to,\" she said on the episode.\nReason #2409 why you should never date someone you meet at your therapist’s office: Seth, played by Jon Bon Jovi in “Games People Play.” In the episode, Seth takes Carrie out to dinner, plays a sexy game of Twister, and tells her he’s in therapy because he’s “really fucked up about women… after I sleep with them I lose interest” — after sleeping with Carrie.\nRemember when Samantha used Lucy Liu’s name for a Birkin bag that had a 5-year waiting list? On “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,” Samantha committed this very crime – a travesty in the PR world – and got caught by Lucy, who played herself on the episode.\nIn the L.A.-set episode, appropriately titled \"Escape From New York,\" SMG played Debbie, the \"most ambitious and feared creature,\" according to Carrie. Debbie was a junior development executive who really, really wanted to make a movie out of Carrie's columns. She also predicted that the movie would be \"chick flick big\" before declaring that the man who came up with that term \"should have his balls cut off.\"\nIn the same L.A. episode as SMG, Matthew McConaughey played a hyper version of himself who was interested in Carrie's movie and her columns. In a cringe-worthy business meeting, the SATC version of Matthew declared that he wanted to play Mr. Big and sleep with Carrie, all while biting on a toothpick. \"We are animals, men, women, walking the earth,\" he said in this scene. \"We are made of head, heart, and loins. We're talking about using them, am I right?\" Nah. Carrie was good, which is why she GTFO of there.\n\nBefore she was Bailey on Grey’s Anatomy, Chandra Wilson played a cop who confronted Samantha about her Richard “CHEATER” posters in the episode titled \"Anchors Away.\" When Samantha explained, “This man said he loved me, and I caught him eating another woman’s pussy,” the extremely understanding cop backed off in full support of this public shaming.\nCarrie’s columns never did turn into a movie, but they did turn into a book thanks to the brains of Lily Martin, book agent, played by Molly Shannon. Together with Courtney Masterson (Amy Sedaris; see next slide), Lily transformed Carrie's words  into something with a spine. At their first meeting, Lily got right to the point: “Is it hopeful? What's the message? What’s your point of view, after all the break ups and disappointments and train wrecks? You still believe he’s out there, right?” That gasp you heard? Millions of people asking why after all these years, Lily still knows what they’re thinking. \nWhen she was not finishing Lily’s sentences, Courtney (Amy Sedaris) was busy introducing future lovers to each other. Case in point: Carrie and Berger, who met while Carrie was in a book meeting with Courtney at her office. Hard to believe this relationship eventually ended with a Post-it note by way of The Hamptons, motorcycle rides, and a white noise machine that only took Carrie to the rainforest.\nBefore he was Tag on Friends, Eddie Cahill played Sean, Carrie’s bisexual “generation-something else” fling that she met at a party celebrating his “internet magazine… that I still couldn’t find on my computer.” Carrie Bradshaw and her internet talk! Despite the fact that they had a great time on her ice skating date (she smoked and drank on the ice like a rebellious young!) Carrie was not prepared for where he took her to next: a party attended by the next SATC guest star on this list...\n... Alanis! On \"Boy, Girl, Boy Girl..\" the Canadian singer played Dawn, who kisses Carrie in a game of spin the bottle. Following the experience, which \"wasn't bad, kind of like chicken,\" Carrie went home and confirmed that she was indeed  \"too old to play this game.\" Other than Carrie's giant flower brooch (which of course got an update in one of the movies), this kiss was a shining moment for the episode.\nTo give back, Charlotte volunteered to be a guide for the blind on season six. Part of her training required walking in public with a mask and a guide to experience what the blind experience. Enter: Carrie, who fails miserably as Charlotte's guide. I guess this is why you shouldn't perform these training exercises at a Barneys, especially with stellar shoe salesmen like this one, played by SJP's real-life BFF Andy Cohen, around.\nThere was no one better than Kat Dennings for the role of Jenny Brier, a bratty, lip-gloss wearing 13-year-old who asks Samantha to plan her Bat Mitzvah on season three. When Samantha hesitates, Jenny name drops Carson Daly and \"The Clintons\" (who \"of course can't make it\") before casually revealing her bank account: \"We'd be lucky if we can swing this for under a mil.\" To which Samantha responds, \"We'll never get *NSYNC.\"\nOn an episode titled \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" Samantha has a fling with Adam, a director who has well, funky spunk. When he says she's just trying to avoid blowjobs and that they're \"easy,\" Samantha, arguably the best sex-ed teacher (and life coach) on TV, launches into one of the most memorable SATC speeches: \"I love giving head. Easy? You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there. Teeth placement, jaw stress, suction, gag reflex, all the while bobbing up and down trying to breathe through our noses. Easy? Honey, they don't call it a job for nothing.\" Mic. Drop.\nOn season four, Margaret Cho played Lynne, a fashion show producer who recruits Carrie to walk in a show that features New Yorkers and models alike. “No one is more New York or has more style than you,” she says on the episode, “The Real Me.” When Carrie hesitates, Lynne delivers another convincing command: “You’re fucking doing my show. If I have to hunt you down, skin you alive, and have one of the models fucking wear you.” The only problem with this character was that there was not enough of her. Imagine her having a showdown with Samantha?\nPeggy is Cosmopolitan.com’s entertainment writer, specializing in Leonardo DiCaprio, This Is Us, and the royals.

{"title": "Spring 2024 Makeup Trends We Love from Fashion Week", "date": "2023-10-01 03:58:00", "text": "Fresh off the runway. \nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year—no, it’s not the holidays (yet); however, it is a fashion holiday: fashion month. And while you may be eyeing the celebs sitting front row or dreaming of your next outfit, the runway is the perfect place to discover what’s next in beauty. \nThis season, the crystal ball, er, runway, proved that even though we’re not masking up as frequently (rethink that: Covid cases are rising), eyes are a major focus and using color as a way of expression. Skin is in—with fresh faces and dewy skin taking priority on the runway. In fact, this season, many skincare brands, prepped models’ skin for the runway. After all, if you want great looking makeup, you must take care of its base: Your face. Brandon Maxwell leaned into a skin-focused beauty look, utilizing Noble Panacea products for a hydrated, fresh glow. \nDo you want to peek into the future to see what’s in store for 2024? Katie Jane Hughes, celebrity makeup artist and founder of KJH.brand whose clients include Hailey Bieber and Karlie Kloss as well as Kim Baker, celebrity makeup artist and founder of Glamazon Beauty divulge to ELLE.com all top Spring 2024 makeup trends, fresh off the runway!\nGraphic liner, floating eyeliner—whatever you want to call it, it’s a vibe and you will see it all Spring/Summer 2024. This graphic liner look on Paloma Elsesser at Eckhaus Latta gives a butterfly wing effect and plays up her high cheekbones. \n“I love how a graphic eye can be an accessory to your look,” shares Katie Jane Hughes in response to the Jil Sander show at Milan Fashion Week.\nCelebrity makeup artist and Lancôme Global International Makeup Artist Sheika Dailey took us to the year 3000 with this futuristic cat eye. Playing with negative space and floating lines in the inner eye, ups the sex appeal of this sultry look. “It’s editorial yet still super wearable and sexy,” says Hughes. You can read more about the look, here.\n“I predict that the Spring/Summer ’24 makeup trends are going to be all about vibrant, bold, color eyeliners,” shares Glamazon Beauty founder and celebrity makeup artist Kim Baker. Curious as to which colors? Baker says, “Eyeliner in bold over the top shades such as Periwinkle, royal blue, vibrant red, and shocking pink” will be all over the lids of trendsetters and beauty girlies next spring.\nHughes also agrees that color eyeliner is a big Spring/Summer ’24 trend. “I love how they matched the eye look to the fashion at Helmut Lang,” says Hughes. “In 2024, the vibrant color lined eye will dominate the street and our makeup bag,” adds Baker.\nDon’t have colored eyeliner? You can fake it with eyeshadow. “We saw royal blue being used at shows such as Altier Ndigo. Makeup artist T. Cooper used the shade ‘Oshun’ featured in the Supreme Being Palette by Glamazon Beauty to create a killer eye look that works for runway to real-way,” says Baker.\nFor Spring/Summer ’24, imperfection is perfection. And while we normally see this trend with the hair, this season, it’s visible with makeup in a bold, bright way. The mismatched eyeshadow seen at Chopova Lowena was a favorite for Hughes. She shares, “I think this is a really cool and fresh take on how to do eyeshadow that is unusual and out of the box.”\nAt Phillip Lim 3.1, this neon, one shadow look plays up negative space in opposite accords.\n“The look I kept seeing across the board was glowing skin. Everyone had dewy, glowing skin and I can’t think of a better feature to play up for Spring and Summer,” says Baker. At Retrofete, it was all about sexy, glowy, and hydrated skin. Elyse Reneau, Executive Director of Global Beauty at Too Faced states, “Humidity has never looked so sculpted!” \nAt Altuzurra, celebrity makeup artist Diane Kendal showcased her famous “flawless face” technique that she developed early in her career. It focuses on making skin look as radiant and perfect as possible, using minimal makeup.\nMermaidcore gets an update for Spring/Summer ’24. At Sandy Liang, rhinestones were placed haphazardly around the eyes to mimic barnacles. Into this look? You can read our full take on it, here.\nMermaidcore is more than just rhinestones and shades of blue and green. Jason Wu’s interpretation highlights healthy skin. “Inspired by Jason’s vision of experiencing rebirth after a shipwreck, we crafted a cohesive makeup look that exuded a dewy, aquatic allure,” shares Kendal, who was the Lead Makeup Artist. Wu’s Kindness For Your Lips Lip Oil was applied on the high cheekbones for a luminous glow.\nIf a sensual siren decided to attend a rave, this look is how I envision their makeup. The amalgamation of blue, green, and yellow mimics underwater coral reefs and is a festival of color for the eyes. Somewhere, somehow, I think Ariel would approve. \nDanielle James is the Digital Beauty Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "What's the Deal with Probiotics for Women?", "date": "2023-09-30 23:46:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nCan you stop your stomach issues with a single capsule? \nWhen we think about bacteria, negative connotations often come to mind. But, not all bacteria is bad, and probiotics are the prime example of what health experts call good bacteria. “Probiotics are friendly, healthy, good-for-you bacteria that work to improve your health,” says Dr. Roshini Raj, a gastroenterologist, author, and founder of Tula Skincare. Most notably, probiotics can help to promote a healthy gut, but these essential microorganisms can also lead to clear skin, a high-performing immune system, and balanced pH levels (down there) for women. \nAs for how to ingest probiotics, it’s essential to note that they are naturally found in foods like greek yogurt, kombucha, and kimchi. However, depending on your diet, you might not consume enough probiotics on a daily basis. In that case, you might want to consider taking probiotic supplements. “When choosing a probiotic supplement, the first step is to look at the ingredients,” Dr. Raj advises. “You want powerful ingredients that are not only good for you but that will also be effective.”\nThere are an array of probiotic supplements that are formulated to target specific concerns, so the first step is to understand what exactly you need help with. For example, if you are experiencing digestive issues, the Cleveland Clinic suggests selecting a capsule that contains lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, bacillus or saccharomyces boulardii. We know these names sound extremely complicated, so it might also make sense to consult your doctor or a professional that could point you in the right direction.\nAccording to Dr. Raj, if you incorporate effective probiotic supplements into your diet, you should start to feel, and look, much healthier. “After my patients began probiotic treatments, I saw a significant improvement not only in their internal health but also in their appearance,\" says Dr. Raj. “Oftentimes their skin was calmer and clearer and I could tell they were feeling better before they had the chance to tell me.” But don’t just take Dr. Raj’s word, try it yourself! \nAhead, scroll through a list of the best probiotics to improve your overall health.  \nGarden of Life’s probiotics are crafted specifically for women  to support vaginal, digestive, and immune health. Their one-a-day capsules also lack most major allergens including dairy, soy, or gluten.\nType: Capsules \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.6/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I've been taking this women's probiotic for about 6 months and it has helped me so much and I will keep buying it every month. I give it 10/10.”\nIt tastes like a peach-flavored treat, but will actually help with digestion. On top of probiotics, this gummy also has fiber, which encourages your digestive tract to run smoothly.\nType: Gummy \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Gluten-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I started taking these a year ago as I had chronic diverticulitis flare-ups and someone recommended them to me. Ever since I began taking these, my intestinal tract has been working well regularly (sorry if this is TMI) and I have had NO flare-ups at all. I am so happy to not have the pain of diverticulitis and to not have to take the antibiotic treatments that make me nauseated! These gummies also taste delicious and it is hard to eat just one.”\nAnybody who has suffered through a single urinary tract infection never wants to repeat the situation—and these were formulated with that in mind. Also, these probiotics help to balance vaginal pH and bacteria so that you can avoid dreaded yeast infections, \nType: Capsule \nDosage: 2 daily \nCertified: Gluten-free, dairy free  \nTarget Rating: 4.9/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I went through a year of UTIs and this has helped to not only keep them at bay but make my overall health feel better.”\nThis symbiotic formula includes prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics which work to support gut health and immunity.

And I definitely notice a difference when I switch to other brands.”\nPop two of these blackberry flavored gummies for a dosage of 3 billion CFUs and smoother digestion. All Lemme products are created with botanical blends that are completely vegan. \nType: Gummy \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan, gelatin-free  \nLemme Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying :\"I know what you're thinking—another Kardashian business, no thanks.

More specifically, these capsules are infused with ceramides, which help to promote hydrated skin.  \nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free  \nTula Rating: 4.1/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"Just finishing my 30-day supply. My skin is clear and I’ve noticed some new hair growth. I haven’t noticed any changes as far as helping with bloating but will try it for another 30 days and see if I notice a difference.”\nHUM Nutrition is renowned for creating effective  supplements, and these potent Gut Instinct capsules are spiked with 10 strains of probiotics for better digestion and immunity. Clinical studies conducted by HUM proved that 90% of customers were satisfied after regularly consuming the Gut Instinct capsules.\nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Vegan  \nBlue Mercury Rating:: 4.7/5\nWhat reviewers are saying:  “I have taken other probiotics before and have not felt as comfortable in my gut as I do with Gut Instinct! I am more regular, have less bloating with eating and it does not irritate my stomach. I am thankful I found HUM Nutrition and will be trying more of their supplements soon!”\nIf you’re a gym-goer or a running enthusiast, you probably know that maintaining a supported immune system helps with your overall athletic performance. Klean’s probiotics were designed to do just that by supplying 15 billion beneficial live organisms. These probiotics are also completely free of artificial coloring and sweeteners, which is particularly important for those who wish to cultivate a balanced nutritional diet.\nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, wheat-free, soy-free  \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “Love this supplement! All of the good stuff and no icky extras. You get exactly what you need and can actually be absorbed by the body unlike the off brand stuff. As a group fitness instructor and health coach, I recommend it to all my clients.”\nIf you’re on a budget, NewRhythm Probiotics might just be for you.

I have taken a probiotic daily for over 10yrs and this is BY FAR the best one. I will NEVER change brands again. The 20 strains with 50 billion cfus is the absolute best formulation!”\nRoshini Raj, M.D., is practicing gastroenterologist in New York City.

{"title": "The 10 Best Collagen Supplements for Hair Growth", "date": "2023-09-30 23:37:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nEager to have luscious locks? Look no further. \nThere’s nothing more upsetting than looking in the mirror and noticing sparse areas of hair on your scalp— dare we say bald spots. For those of you who have dealt with hair loss or hair thinning, you've probably gone down a rabbit hole of research, attempting to discover the best ways to restore your beloved strands. While desperately scouring the internet for answers, we're guessing that you came across a variety of hair growth shampoos and hair growth oils . And perhaps you found a thing or two about collagen.\nOn a basic level, collagen is one of the most abundant structural proteins found in the body. Composed of several types of amino acids, this powerful protein helps to promote skin elasticity, support muscular health, and encourage hair growth. “The most abundant amino acids in collagen are glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine, which are crucial for maintaining the health, elasticity, and strength of skin and hair,” says Dr. Dusan Sajic, board certified dermatologist. Thus, it comes as no surprise that many of us rely on collagen supplements to foster thriving hair.  \nConsuming collagen supplements can be a great after-the-fact solution, but it should also be considered as a preventative measure, especially as we get older.  “As we age, not only do we produce less collagen, we also lose excessive collagen due to environmental stressors like UV exposure, smoke exposure, and poor health habits,” says Shannon Augustine, board certified aesthetic nurse practitioner. But fear not, because luckily, there are plenty of collagen supplements that exist— from capsules to powders, and even liquids. Ahead, we’ve curated a list of the best collagen products for hair growth and we've also consulted medical and cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Dusan Sajic as well as aesthetic nurse practicioner Shannon Augustine, who have shared everything you need to know about collagen. \nVital Proteins’ formula is packed with hydrolyzed collagen peptides that help promote hair growth in addition to encouraging nail, bone, and joint health. Simply take a scoop of this powder and mix it into your favorite drink for your daily dose of collagen. \nType: Powder \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Paleo-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I noticed my hair was growing faster. I didn't measure it, but I feel convinced that I've experienced faster hair growth.”\nAnthony’s Collagen Peptide Powder is extracted from grass fed cattle,  which makes this blend rich in protein. And despite the fact that this collagen is animal-derived, Anthony’s formula is crafted without hormones, steroids, and antibiotics. \nType: Powder  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, pure hydrolysate\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.6/5 \nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve used this collagen consistently for a few years. I put it in my morning coffee or smoothies. My skin looks brighter and my hair is noticeably healthier.”— Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nAccording to Spoiled Child’s website, users reported stronger hair simply after 6 weeks of consuming the E27 Extra Strength Liquid Collagen on a regular basis.  For the best results, it's recommended to take one to two tablespoons a day.\nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen Peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, non-GMO\nSpoiled Child Rating:  4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “The mango flavor adds a little sweetness and kick to my morning smoothies. I love that it has hyaluronic acid—the hero ingredient in the Hailey Beiber Erewhon smoothie. Now I can have a hydrating smoothieat home for a fraction of the price.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nThese citrus flavored gummies are not formulated with any animal-derived ingredients, so they're perfect for those who are on a vegetarian or vegan diet.  In addition to collagen and biotin, these gummies are also infused with zinc, which is a crucial element regarding hair growth. \nType: Gummies  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, biotin, zinc\nCertified: Vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free\nSephora Rating: 5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve tried my fair share of skin, hair and nail gummies and these are my favorite. I’ve been trying to grow out my hair after bleaching it for a year and I needed all the help I could get. The best part is they taste great!”\nIf you love the taste of pomegranate, you won’t be able to resist NeoCell’s liquid collagen blend. Formulated with vitamin C, this nourishing mixture helps to strengthen hair strands.   \nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, vitamin C\nCertified: Gluten-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’m not losing hair like I have been for several years. So few hairs in the brush after one month of two tablespoons each night. It's thicker, as well.”\n Kourtney Kardashian is all about living a healthy lifestyle, so it comes as no surprise that she translates that same mindset into her brand, Lemme. Lemme’s biotin and collagen supplements come in the form of delicious gummies that are comprised of natural nutrients like biotin and zinc, which promote hair, skin, and nail health. \nType:  Gummies \nKey Ingredients: Grass-fed collagen peptides, biotin, vitamin C\nCertified: Non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, paraben-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.9/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I started using Lemme Glow on a whim, and it’s become a must-have in my beauty routine. It's made my skin smoother, and my hair and nails look healthier than ever.”\nIf you’re always on the go, it might be helpful to pop a bottle of collagen capsules into your purse. We highly recommend  Ancient Nutrition’s Collagen Peptide Pills as they’re great for rejuvenating various parts of your body including your hair, joints, and nails. \nType:  Capsules\nKey Ingredients: Bovine collagen, ashwagandha root and leaf extract, amla berry extract \nCertified: Non-GMO, keto friendly, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free\nRating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “Noticed results within a couple of weeks! My nails grew and weren’t brittle anymore, my hair was thicker and my skin is definitely looking and feeling better!”\nA few drops a day will keep the thin hair away. Raw Science’s liquid collagen and biotin drops help to generate healthy strands, especially for women who are struggling with hair loss. If you enjoy sipping on tea, try putting a few drops of this liquid mixture into a cup of lemon ginger tea for a tasty drink. \nType:  Liquid \nKey Ingredients: Biotin, bovine collagen peptides, vegetable glycerin, natural raspberry flavor \nCertified: Gluten-free\nLemme Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve been using this supplement for two years now. It definitely helps to grow your hair and nails out quickly. Easy to use.”\nThere are various kinds of collagen, and one of the most popular types is marine collagen.

Not only does it promote healthy skin, hair, and nails, but it also provides proven joint mobility support.”\nDr. Sajic tells ELLE.com that collagen is a protein formulated with amino acids that provide structure, elasticity, and strength to both skin and hair. “Altogether around fifty-six percent or more of the amino acids in collagen are foundational for skin and hair proteins, and thus has a great ratio that will contribute directly to hair health and vitality,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while collagen can certainly help to solve some of your hair problems, maintaining a healthy diet is equally important. “Optimal hair health also requires a more comprehensive approach, including other proteins, vitamins, minerals, and care practices,” Dr. Sajic says. \nAlthough collagen is widely recognized for its ability to promote healthy hair and skin, this abundant protein also plays a crucial role in other bodily functions including joint health and bone health. “Collagen assists in maintaining the integrity of cartilage, which is essential for healthy joints, and it helps to maintain bone density, which is crucial for preventing age-related bone issues like osteoporosis,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nIf you’re looking to target these areas of your body, or simply interested in a supplement that provides a cohesive approach, it’s worth incorporating collagen supplements into your daily wellness routine. \nAlso to note, some collagen supplements are infused with additional nutrients that help to nourish the body. “Collagen supplements may also include vitamins like vitamin C, zinc, vitamin B, and omega-3s which further support your body and health,” Augustine says. \nSo, we’ve heard about all the wonderful benefits of collagen but are there any side effects? Dr. Sajic shares that although collagen is generally safe for most individuals, there are a few things to note. “Some may experience side effects like stomach discomfort, a bad taste or possible allergic reactions,” Dr. Sajic says. “It’s essential to choose high-quality collagen supplements and consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen,” he adds.\nTo avoid allergic reactions, or any added ingredients that might not sit well with your body, Augustine also suggests taking the time to thoroughly read the ingredient labels.  \n“You should always talk to your health care provider before taking any oral supplements or medications,” says Augustine. She also explains that consulting a healthcare professional is especially important if you are taking daily medications or have serious drug or food allergies.\nDr. Sajic shares that those with fish, pork, or bovine allergies should avoid collagen, as many collagen supplements are derived from these animal sources. “It’s also important to talk to your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease, as the excess protein may put extra stress on these organs,” he adds. \nCollagen supplements exist in many forms— including liquid, powder, and capsules— but they all have relatively equal effects. \"There are not enough non-bias studies to suggest that one is better than the other,” Augustine shares. \nAt the end of the day, it simply boils down to your personal preferences, lifestyle, and dietary restrictions. “Liquid collagen can be consumed directly or mixed into beverages, while powder can be added to smoothies, coffee, or baked goods,” Dr. Sajic says. If you would prefer not to mix collagen with your food or drink, you can always take a capsule. However, Dr. Sajic notes that depending on the capsule, it might not be absorbed as efficiently as other forms of collagen. \n“For most people, collagen should be taken once daily,” Dr. Sajic says. “Dosage can range from 2.5 to 15 grams daily, depending on the individual’s age, health, and specific skin or hair concerns.” And as with anything, patience and consistency is key, so make sure that you keep track of your collagen intake. “It may take several weeks, if not three to four months, for you to start noticing the benefits of collagen supplements,” Dr. Sajic adds.\nDr. Dusan Sajic is a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist, the director of the Derma Skin Institute, and the creator of  Sajic Skin.\nShannon Augustine, NP is a is a board certified nurse practitioner and self-proclaimed expert injector at  SkinSpirit.\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.
