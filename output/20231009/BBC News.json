The family are running out of baby milk, and only have about two-days of supplies for the rest of the family, he said. \nMany are currently without electricity and internet, and could soon be out of essential food and water supplies.\nEven before the latest restrictions, residents of Gaza faced widespread food insecurity, restrictions on movement and water shortages.\n\"My family have nothing to do with Hamas,\" he said. \n\"My mother-in-law is a retired nurse from Ninewells [Hospital]; my brother-in-law who lives in Gaza is a doctor, nothing to do with Hamas, but they are along with a lot of other Gazans potentially going collective punishment, and that cannot be justified.\"\nMore than 10 Britons feared dead or missing in Israel\nGaza 'soon without fuel, medicine and food'\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Labour plans to fight next election on economy", "date": "2023-10-09 13:05:16", "text": "This video can not be played\nReeves on Covid fraud: We want that money back\nLabour says it will fight the next election on the economy after the shadow chancellor revealed policies to bring in an \"era of economic security\".\nStepping on to traditional Conservative election ground, Rachel Reeves promised to cut waste and drive growth in her speech to Labour conference.\n\"Responsibility must always come first,\" she said.\nAnd she unveiled plans aimed at speeding up projects like battery factories and 5G infrastructure.\nShe told Labour conference: \"There is no hope without security, you cannot dream big if you cannot sleep in peace at night.\"\nMs Reeves said Labour would \"wage a war against fraud, waste and inefficiency\", including a \"crackdown on Tory ministers' private jet habit\".\nLabour was \"ready to serve\" and \"ready to lead\", she added.\nShe said that \"taxpayers' money should be spent with the same care with which we spend our own money\" but that under the Conservatives it had been \"treated with disrespect\". \nLabour would seek to \"slash government consultancy spending\", she said, adding that the cost of hiring consultants has \"almost quadrupled in just six years\".\nThere had been calls from Labour delegates to reinstate the northern leg of HS2 - scrapped by the prime minister last week.\nMs Reeves made no commitments to rebuild the high-speed line but said a Labour government would commission an independent inquiry into the project.\nThere was also a pledge to increase the national minimum wage \"taking into account the real cost of living,\" without specifying the amount. \nLabour has made a concerted effort over recent months to raise Ms Reeves's profile, given she would be not only at the heart of a Labour government, but their election campaign too.\nInternally, Labour figures say that taking the fight to the Conservatives on the economy rather than, say, the NHS, is a measure of their political confidence. \nOne senior source said that elections are \"won and lost on the economy\", adding: \"We're not in our safe zones any more, we're on their turf.\"\nMs Reeves speech was bookended by glossy videos and a lavish introduction by Cameron-era government advisor Mary Portas.\nMs Portas declared Ms Reeves would be the best-qualified chancellor ever.\nMs Reeves was also labelled \"a serious economist\" who \"understands the big picture\" by former Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, in a video played after the speech.\nAnd the shadow chancellor's fiery rhetoric repeatedly brought the audience in the conference hall to its feet. \nHer vow to levy VAT on private school fees prompted a prolonged bout of whooping in the hall, as did her refrain - used more than once in the speech - that Labour is \"ready to serve\" and \"ready to lead.\"\nMuch of the speech was focused on how Labour would achieve growth in office, with Ms Reeves saying Labour would overhaul planning rules to speed up green energy, battery factories and 5G projects.\nUnder plans announced on Monday, 300 new planners across the public sector would be hired and planning guidance to speed up the process re-written.\nDecision times for major projects have increased by two-thirds since 2012, to four years according to Ms Reeves, and economic growth and net zero considerations need to be factored in.\nEarlier, Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the proposals, saying long-term investment in infrastructure was a \"key ingredient to get our economy back to growth\". \n\"We are pleased to see a future Labour government would support the building of large-scale factories and improve our digital infrastructure, such as 5G connectivity,\" she said.\nUnions broadly welcomed the speech, with Unison general secretary Christina McAnea praising Ms Reeves' \"compelling vision\". \nMomentum, the left-wing pressure group set up to support former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said the speech Labour's plans were \"disappointing\" and failed to \"rise to the huge crises facing Britain\".\nMs Reeves also proposed establishing an anti-corruption commissioner aimed at recovering money lost as a result of fraud and waste during the pandemic.\nOn Monday, the Labour leadership was for a showdown with Unite - historically the party's biggest financial backer - over the union's call to nationalise critical infrastructure, starting with privatised electricity and gas networks.\nDelegates will vote later on whether the party should adopt the policy, which is opposed by Ms Reeves and Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe union's motion calls for UK energy to be brought into public ownership, and also to commit to deliver infrastructure projects, including HS2.\nUnite leader Sharon Graham accused the Labour party of being \"timid\".\n\"Labour need to act more like a 1945 transformative government,\" she told the Today programme.\nMs Graham said she thought the shadow chancellor was \"doing a good job, but I don't think we're going to get the type of growth they're talking about quickly\". \nIt is time \"to look at the economy differently\", she said.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nLabour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy\nLabour urges ministers to 'clean up' Covid contracts\nLabour pledges watchdog power after Truss mini-budget\nLabour rules out wealth tax if party wins power\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Metro Bank strikes late-night rescue deal", "date": "2023-10-09 09:25:11", "text": "Metro Bank has struck a deal to raise extra funds from investors that it said will secure its future.\nThe deal was announced late on Sunday after days of intense speculation about the bank's financial position.\nThe Bank of England reportedly asked larger lenders if they were interested in buying Metro, while banks were said to be eyeing up some of its assets.\nBut on Sunday, Metro Bank said it had raised £325m in new funding, as well as refinancing £600m of debt.\nMetro's chief executive, Daniel Frumkin, said the deal marked \"a new chapter\" for the troubled bank.\nMetro Bank's shares had slumped last week after reports suggested it needed to raise cash to shore up its finances. Its share price rebounded on Monday in response to the deal.\nHowever, Simon Samuels, a former managing director at Barclays and Citi, told the BBC's Today programme that while the financing bought Metro Bank some time, it did not address the \"fundamental challenges\" of the bank's strategy of focusing on High Street branches which was \"very expensive\".\nWhile many banks have been closing branches and shifting to online banking - which accelerated during the Covid pandemic - Metro continues to focus on bricks and mortar.     \n\"Essentially, Metro finds itself with an unsustainable cost base,\" he said, adding that he thought Metro's strategy \"has got little chance of succeeding in the long run\".\n\"Eventually [Metro Bank] may end up being part of a larger group.\"\nThe bank has insisted all along that its finances remain strong and it continues to meet all regulatory requirements.\nBut under the deal announced on Sunday, Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal will become Metro Bank's biggest shareholder with a 53% stake. \nHis firm, Spaldy Investments, will sink £102m into the bank.\nMetro Bank was founded in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis and was the first to open in the UK in more than 100 years.\nIt positioned itself as a so-called \"challenger\" bank to the big High Street names, with its promise of keeping branches open seven days a week.\nIt now has 2.7 million customers and holds about £15bn worth of deposits in 76 branches. \nBut last week reports suggested it need to raise £600m. The Financial Times also reported over the weekend that several rivals were weighing up potential bids for part of the business.\nIn Sunday's announcement. Metro Bank said that it had raised £325m in capital from existing shareholders and new backers.\nThe Bank of England, which had been monitoring the situation closely, welcomed the deal.\nMetro Bank also said it was still in discussions about raising cash by selling up to £3bn of its residential mortgages. \nHomeowners with mortgages from Metro Bank do not face any immediate change, but if a deal goes through some customers might end up having their loans managed by another bank in the future.\nMetro Bank's shares rose by about 10% on Monday, taking its share price to about 50p - close to the level it had been last week before reports on the bank's financial situation emerged.\nHowever, the share price is still down nearly 60% since the start of the year, and well below the peak of £40.19 it reached in 2018.\nMr Frumkin said the new deal meant Metro Bank could continue expanding and would become more profitable over the coming years.\n\"Our strong franchise is underpinned by our loyal customer base and engaged colleagues and we will continue to develop the Metro Bank offer,\" he said.\nThe lender has faced a number of challenges in recent years after an accounting scandal in 2019, which led to some top executives, including its founder, leaving the company.\nIt returned to profit in the six months to the end of June this year - the first half-year profit the bank had seen since 2019.\nIn July, Mr Frumkin said that 2023 would be a \"transitional year\" for the firm and that it planned to open 11 more branches across the north of England in 2024 and 2025.\nMore recently, Metro Bank had asked City watchdogs for permission to use its own ratings system to value its mortgages and its assets.\nBut regulators turned down the request last month, saying that they wanted the bank to use an external rating system for now.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nWhat's going on at Metro Bank?\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Afghanistan earthquake: More than 1,000 dead as villagers dig for survivors", "date": "2023-10-09 11:44:49", "text": "Rescuers are digging for survivors of a powerful earthquake that flattened whole villages in Afghanistan, killing more than 1,000 people.\nThe 6.3-magnitude quake struck Saturday morning in Herat province, a barren landscape dotted with mud brick homes. \nVillagers are still using shovels and bare hands to search for the missing - more than 500 people, the UN says.  \nAid, delayed by blocked routes and communication lines being down, only started to trickle in on Monday. \nThe quake hit Zindajan, a rural district some 40km (25 miles) from Herat city, where \"100% of homes are estimated to have been completely destroyed,\" according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). \nImages from the villages show entire houses, which were too fragile to withstand such a quake, reduced to rubble. \n\"We came home and saw there was nothing left. Everything had turned to mud,\" one resident Nek Mohammad told AFP news agency. \"We started to dig with shovels and whatever we had to rescue women and children from the rubble.\"\nThe Taliban government and aid agencies initially struggled to estimate the death toll, or how many remained missing. It's unlikely officials had population records for such remote villages. \nThe area is also home to communities displaced by war and drought, making it difficult for the local administration to know exactly how many people have been living there. \nIll-equipped hospitals have been struggling to accommodate the injured, who now number more than 1,600. Many of them were sent to the Herat Regional Hospital, where teams from the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have been since Saturday.\n\"Fortunately, most of the patients arriving are non-emergency cases,\" says Prue Coakley, the acting country representative for MSF in Afghanistan. \"However, many of them do not have homes to return to, that is why many of them are remaining in the hospital while authorities look for alternative places for them to stay.\"\nShe added that a team focused on paediatric patients had been sent to the hospital in Herat. The UN says a majority of the quake survivors who are being treated are women and children, while doctors tell the BBC women and children also account for many of the dead.\nThe Taliban government has said quake survivors are in urgent need of food, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents for shelter. Several aid agencies have dispatched help, including the Afghan Red Cross Society, MSF, World Food Programme and Unicef. But the agencies say the cash-strapped country needs more aid. \nAfghanistan has been reeling from an economic crisis since the Taliban takeover in 2021, when aid given directly to the government was stopped.\nFew countries have pledged money since Saturday's quake. China's Red Cross Society has offered $200,000 (£164,220) in emergency cash aid, Chinese media reported. \nNeighbouring Pakistan has said it is in contact with Afghan officials and will \"extend all possible support to the recovery effort.\"\nAfghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes - especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range as it lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.\nIn June last year, the province of Paktika was hit by a 5.9 magnitude quake which killed more than 1,000 people and left tens of thousands homeless.\nHundreds dead in powerful Afghan earthquake\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Mr Holmes used monies obtained by the loan agreements to fund a property development venture in or around Vancouver, Canada,\" the band alleged in the papers, arguing that he had used his position as their manager as leverage.\nThey added that the debt could have affected Holmes' ability to negotiate favourable terms for the band's ongoing Music of The Spheres tour.\nThe court documents further allege that Holmes failed to \"adequately to supervise and control the tour budget\", with expensive equipment ordered or bought that was not fit for purpose.\nThis included a $9.7 million (£8 million) video screen that was so big it could not be brought on tour, and was only used for 10 performances in Buenos Aires. \nSixteen bespoke stage pylons were also ordered at a cost of €10.6 million (£9 million) before it transpired they were unusable, the court documents allege.\n\"Had Mr Holmes exercised reasonable care and skill in the performance of his obligations\", the counter-claim continues, the band would not have incurred costs of at least £17.5 million.\nAsked about the counter-claim this weekend, a spokesperson for Holmes told The Times: \"Coldplay know they are in trouble with their defence. \n\"Accusing Dave Holmes of non-existent ethical lapses and other made-up misconduct will not deflect from the real issue at hand - Coldplay had a contract with Dave, they are refusing to honour it and they need to pay Dave what they owe him\".\nThe former manager will now respond to the counter-claim as the case continues.\nMindboggling to join Coldplay on stage, choir says\nChris Martin performs couple's wedding song in pub\nColdplay to stop making music as a band in 2025\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Rwanda can be trusted, UK Supreme Court told", "date": "2023-10-09 12:43:48", "text": "Rwanda can be trusted to treat humanely any asylum seekers sent to the country, lawyers for the home secretary have told the Supreme Court.\nOpening their case, the lawyers said the Court of Appeal had been wrong to block the UK government's plan to remove some asylum seekers to Rwanda amid fears about its record.\nThey urged the highest court in the UK to let the scheme go ahead. \nThe scheme has been in limbo since it was stopped 16 months ago. \nUnder the policy, anyone who comes to the UK without authorisation from a safe country and seeks asylum - in practice meaning people crossing the English Channel in small boats from France - can be blocked from making a claim for protection and sent to Rwanda instead. \nMinisters say this would deter criminal people-smuggling gangs - although that's disputed and officials estimate the scheme could be more expensive than dealing with the migrants in the UK. \nIn June 2022, the European Court of Human Rights blocked the departure of the first flight, saying that British judges needed time to fully consider whether the plan was legal. \nThat battle has now reached the Supreme Court, where five of the UK's most senior lawyers will decide the scheme's fate. \nThe government's lawyers have said that in June the Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that Rwanda's asylum system was so flawed it could send migrants back to their home countries, where they could be mistreated. \nThis video can not be played\nHow dangerous are the English Channel dinghies?\nSir James Eadie KC, for the home secretary, told the Supreme Court there was \"every reason to conclude\" that Rwanda would want the arrangements to work. \nHe said the country had every reputational and financial incentive to treat asylum seekers well - and that even if there were genuine concerns, extensive monitoring had been put in place. \nA government official would be permanently stationed in Kigali to make the deal work and also to flag concerns. There would also be further independent monitoring of what happened to each migrant. \nThese arrangements, alongside the detailed written commitments given to the UK under the £140m scheme, meant there was no legal reason to interfere with the plan. \nSir James said that while critics of the Rwanda plan had warned about the country's human rights record, past incidents were not legally relevant.\nHe said the scheme ensured that both the UK government and Rwanda's treatment of the migrants would comply with legal safeguards under the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. \n\"At the heart of all of this lies compliance with the assurances and the judgments that have to be made about that,\" he said.\n\"There is no challenge at all to the good faith or the intent of Rwanda to comply with the commitments that they have given to the United Kingdom.\"\nLawyers for 10 migrants resisting the plan will begin their submissions later on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations' refugee agency is expected to reiterate its criticisms of the scheme which have been a crucial element of the case so far. \nRwanda Supreme Court showdown: What do we know?\n£63,000 more to remove a migrant than keep in UK\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Economics still had an image problem with women, she told the BBC in 2018.\n\"Even before students enter university they believe economics is a field more oriented to finance and management and women are less interested in those than are men,\" she said. If we explained economics was about \"inequality, health, household behaviour, society, then there'd be a much greater balance,\" she said.\nOn her website she also publishes a blog about her dog, Pika, a golden retriever.\nThe economics prize is different to the original prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace, which were established by Alfred Nobel and first awarded in 1901. \nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Scienceswas established in 1968 and funded by Sweden's central bank.\nElinor Ostrom was the first woman to win the economics prize in 2009, which she was awarded jointly with Oliver E Williamson for research on economic governance.\nIn 2019 Esther Duflo shared the award with her husband Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer, for work that focused on poor communities in India and Kenya.\nEsther Duflo: 'Nobel Prize will be a megaphone'\nThe tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution\nThe spectacular failures and successes of massive dams\nNobel prize for economics awarded\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Big Brother returns: 2.5 million watch as ITV launch show divides opinion", "date": "2023-10-09 08:43:52", "text": "More than 2.5 million people watched 16 contestants enter the Big Brother house as the reality show returned to British TV for the first time in five years.\nThe series has moved to ITV, and the new crop of housemates immediately took part in a \"housewarming party\" with games that had unexpected consequences.\nJenkin, 25, had his suitcase blown up and lost access to hot water for a day.\nThe launch got a mixed reaction - the Telegraph called it \"fun\" but the Times said it felt \"like a Noughties fossil\".\nAJ Odudu and Will Best are the new hosts, but some viewers compared them unfavourably to the previous eras of Davina McCall and Emma Willis.\nDavina posted on X during the first episode on Sunday: \"How's it going? I've got horrific fomo [fear of missing out].\"\nBig Brother transformed British TV when it first began on Channel 4 in 2000, before moving to Channel 5 and eventually being axed in 2018.\nThe launch show was watched by 2m on ITV1, and a further 527,000 on ITV2 - which will be its primary home in the coming weeks.\nIn a four-star review, the Telegraph's James Hall wrote: \"Do we really need Big Brother back? Of course not. Raw and real? Obviously not.\n\"But this was fun and is at least striving for a degree of authenticity while also knowing it has to entertain.\"\nMetro's critic Adam Miller welcomed it back, also awarding four stars and writing that the show's return \"was more impactful than I could have imagined\".\n\"Big Brother shines on deception, tactical game play and sheer ludicrousness  - the launch night alone had all three in abundance,\" he wrote.\nThe line-up is \"the most interesting cast Big Brother has seen in years, possibly ever\", he said, but added that it was \"strange\" that the opening episode was pre-recorded \"knowing how electric those live launches could be\".\nFans were also enthusiastic on social media.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

In our era of shortened attention spans, they'll have to work pretty hard to do so.\"\nIn the Radio Times, Emma Bullimore praised the mix of personalities in the house. \"Crucially, it's not just a set of 16 TikTokers,\" she wrote. \n\"Instead, it genuinely feels like real effort has been made to bring interesting people together for an extraordinary experience. From a bingo caller, to Miss Universe, to an 'ecstatic dancer' who shimmies under the moon on the Isle of Man.\"\nThe jury's out on whether the show can compete with more recent reality TV hits like Love is Blind and The Traitors, she added.\n\"While ITV's reset looks like it may be elevating the brand from the gutter, it's unclear whether it will be enough to dominate the public conversation as the show once did.\"\nThe Times' Carol Midgley said the format was \"showing its age\", however, and \"feels pretty vanilla, pretty basic stuff\" when compared with modern formats.\n\"I can see that ITV wants to replicate the success it has had with Love Island because this is one of the few shows which young people watch in the old-fashioned, nightly way. But this feels tired,\" she wrote.\n\"It's early days and it might get better but on the strength of what we saw tonight, Big Brother has nothing new to tell us.\"\nThere was some drama on the opening night when Jenkin, from Bridgend in south Wales, also unwittingly chose 23-year-old Olivia to be up for the first eviction on Friday.\nHowever, she was later given the chance to save herself from eviction if she can avoid being ranked the least entertaining housemate.\nAhead of the launch, Odudu and Best asked fans to be kind online, posting a video to the Big Brother Instagram account reminding users that the \"housemates are real people with their real lives\".\nAs with recent series of ITV's Love Island, housemates and their families and friends have also been asked to not post content about the show on their individual social media accounts while they are in the house.\nIt comes as broadcasters' duty of care policies have faced scrutiny following a number of controversies involving on-screen talent.\nC4 boss says Big Brother return is depressing\nBig Brother will return next year on ITV2\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "17,500 cervical smear tests to be re-checked in Northern Ireland", "date": "2023-10-09 14:28:12", "text": "About 17,500 women in Northern Ireland are to have their smear tests re-checked as part of a major review of cervical screening dating back to 2008.\nSome of these women will be recalled to have new smear tests carried out, BBC News NI can reveal.\nThe Southern Trust said that the women affected should receive letters by post from Tuesday. \nIt follows a highly critical report by the Royal College of Pathologists (PCPath).\nIt found: \nWhile the Southern Trust says it is reviewing the cases of some 17,500 women, the RCPath report actually recommends that those women considered most at risk should be recalled so they can be reassured by a negative HPV test.\nBroadly, these women are those who had a negative or inadequate result during the 13-year period of the review and have not had any tests since.\nThe Southern Trust did not follow up this recommendation as it does not currently have the resources to carry out repeated smear tests for these women as there is already a backlog across Northern Ireland.\nBBC News NI also understands that the trust is in contact with the family of one woman who recently died from cervical cancer and another woman who is receiving palliative care. \nThe Department of Health called the report's findings \"clearly unacceptable\".\nDr Steve Austin, the trust's medical director, has apologised for what has happened and for the \"stress and anxiety\" caused to women.  \nHe told BBC News NI that there have been ongoing issues with underperforming screeners and that how it was managed \"simply wasn't good enough\".\nA freephone helpline - 0800 9520255 - for those affected has been set up. It will be available Monday to Friday from 9.00-18.30 BST, and from 10.00-16:00 on Saturday and Sunday.\nThis video can not be played\nA woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer has learned that she had three abnormal smear tests that were missed.\nA woman who had to undergo a radical hysterectomy in the Southern Trust in 2019 because of screeners missing abnormal cells in three different smear tests said the latest development was \"shocking and worrying\".\nLast February, the woman told her story as part of a BBC News NI investigation into cervical screening at the Southern Trust. \nWhile the Southern Trust has insisted only a few women may be impacted, they should not have been placed in this position in the first place, said the woman.\nWhile last February she had been hesitant about speaking out, she was glad she did as lives may now be saved.  \nCervical screening can not detect cancer, but detecting and treating abnormal cells may help prevent cancer. No screening process is 100% accurate.\nThe screening looks for the human papillomavirus (HPV) which can cause abnormal cells on the cervix. If HPV is detected a cytology test is used to check for any abnormal cells.  \nUnlike the rest of the UK and Ireland, Northern Ireland does not have the primary HPV screening system in full operation.   \nIn Northern Ireland, the cervical screening process involves two people - a screener and checker analysing slides under a microscope.\nTests taken in the Southern Trust between 1 January 2008 and October 2021 will be re-checked if they also meet the following criteria:\nAs screening is offered to women every three or five years, depending on their age, many women will have had more than one screening test during this timeframe and had subsequent smears which have provided assurance. \nThe trust says it also has to contact women who have moved out of Northern Ireland or are no longer registered with GPs.\nDr Austin says the trust was confident it had not missed anyone in the review.\nThroughout the report, the screeners involved are identified by a number which has been redacted by the health trust. \nThe report highlights that the screener involved in the woman who spoke to the BBC's first test in 2011 was not meeting the required performance standards at that time. \nIt added that person \"failed to achieve the 95% standard for high-grade sensitivity for four consecutive years between 2008 and 2012 and again during 2013-14 to 2014-15\".\nThe Southern Trust has confirmed to BBC News NI that the same screener went on to work in another health trust but is currently no longer working in healthcare.  \nThe report also found that another screener failed to achieve the standards required for five consecutive years from 2014 to 2019 and again from 2020 to 2021; another failed to meet standards for several years between 2014 and 2021.\nThe report, was undertaken by our separate consulting arm RCPath Consulting, which offers a service to commissioners and managers of pathology services. \nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) said laboratories are all performing within required standards and \"there are no similar concerns regarding other labs carrying out this work\".\nIt said processes are in place to monitor this and quality assurance processes are kept under review.\nThe PHA added that while no screening programme could detect all abnormalities, Northern Ireland's screening programme was \"very effective\".\nBBC News NI understands the review of slides is expected to start within the next couple of weeks but will take months, even longer, to complete if women are recalled for a repeat smear. \nThe Department of Health said that the findings of the report \"are clearly unacceptable\".\n\"The department is closely monitoring the actions being taken at trust and regional level in response to the RCPath recommendations,\" it added, in a statement.\nIt added that it was on course for full introduction of primary HPV testing by December 2023 which will mark the start of \"a new era for cervical screening\" and help to clear the current backlog for reporting smear test results.\nSigns of cancer missed in woman's smear tests\nSix month smear wait 'worrying and frustrating'\nNI bowel and cervical screening lags behind UK\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Here are some of their stories.\nThe first inkling Yoni Asher had that his family were inside Gaza was by tracking his wife's mobile phone.\nHis wife Doron and their two children Raz, 5, and Aviv, 3, were staying with relatives close to the border with Gaza when the militants struck.\nYoni told the BBC: \"Saturday, around 10:30 in the morning, was the last call when I spoke with my wife. She told me that terrorists from Hamas had entered the house. \n\"They were in the safe, secure room then the call got disconnected. Later on, I managed to locate her mobile and it was inside Gaza\".\nLater that day, his worst fears were seemingly confirmed when he recognised his family being briefly shown in a video of people being loaded onto the back of a truck.\n\"In the video I recognised my wife and my two daughters, my two little babies,\" he said. \n\"I don't know in what terms or what conditions they are held but you know, the situation is getting much worse. \"\nFor now, like other families, all Yoni can do is hope. \"I'm trying to stay calm. I want to believe there is some contact between the diplomats negotiating or something but we don't know anything - that is the hardest thing\".\nNoam Sagi said his heart sank when Palestinian media began broadcasting from in front of his 74-year-old mother's home, around 400m from the border with Gaza. \nOn Saturday afternoon, the Israeli Army entered grandmother-of-six Ada Sagi's property and found blood stains - but no sign of the elderly woman, he explained.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4, Mr Sagi - who lives in London - said his assumption was that his mother, who teaches Arabic, was among those kidnapped. \n\"We are talking about someone, 74 years old, who went into a safe room and [now] she is not there\", he said. \n\"She is not on the dead list, she is not on the injured list, and it's a small community… 350 people max and they know each other, so they have gone through the process of identifying everyone.\" \nThe community are reporting that the elderly and the young have been abducted, according to Mr Sagi, who said there was not any formal or official confirmation of his mother's whereabouts. He pointed out that she could not run far following a recent hip replacement.\n\"It's somehow completely surreal, sounds like a horror movie, it's hard to compute\", Mr Sagi continued. \n\"Just imagine a lovely, rural village here in the UK and people just going through their lives… and then you are just being snatched out of your house. \n\"It feels unreal… it feels inhumane… it is very upsetting to think that this is even possible. Even in war there are rules, and we are talking about men in their 20s and 30s that come into an old woman's house and snatch her and her neighbours.\"\nHe added that he was scared for his mother, who needs medication.\nHis wife Michal, who also spoke to the BBC, said Ada had allergies.\n\"Without her medicines, we don't know how long she will keep on,\" she said. \"I'm trying not to get into the negative scenarios, they're difficult to imagine.\"\nMr Sagi, who believes he will see his mother again, said he had been expecting her in London next week for her 75th birthday. \nHe described her as a very strong, inspiring and phenomenal woman, adding that he trusted her to \"deal with the situation\".\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\n260 bodies recovered from 'horror movie' festival scene\n'Nobody could help us' - Shock and anger in Israel's Ashkelon\nHow Hamas staged lightning assault no-one thought possible\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

I saw masses of wounded people thrown around.\"\nGilad Karplus, who was working as a masseuse at the festival, told the BBC he also saw people being hit by bullets and managed to escape into the fields in a vehicle with his friends. \n\"Then they [the militants] started firing sniper rifles on us from different places and also heavy artillery.\"\nMr Karplus, who used to work for the Israel Defense Forces, was injured after being fired at from motorcycles but said he and his friends managed to escape and hid in a building. \n\"We heard them [the gunmen] going from door to door, and in a few hours they could have found us, but they didn't know we were there.\"\nEventually, Israeli soldiers and police arrived and Mr Karplus was taken to hospital for treatment. \nThe festival site - with three stages, a camping area and bar and food area - was in the Negev desert, near Kibbutz Re'im. It was not far from the Gaza Strip, from where Hamas fighters crossed over at dawn to launch their attack. They infiltrated towns and villages, taking dozens of people hostage.\nThis video can not be played\nDestroyed cars line road near festival site in chilling video\nEsther Borochov told Reuters she was driving away when her vehicle was rammed into. She saw a young man driving another car, who told her to get in. She did - but the man was then shot at point blank. Esther said she played dead until she was finally rescued by Israeli military.\n\"I couldn't move my legs,\" she told Reuters from the hospital. \"Soldiers came and took us away to the bushes.\"\nMany festivalgoers - like Ortel - hid in nearby bushes and fruit orchards for hours, hoping for the military to arrive and rescue them.\n\"I put the phone on mute mode, and then I started crawling through an orange grove,\" Ortel said. \"Live fire was whistling above me.\"\nGili Yoskovich told the BBC how she hid in a pomelo orchard. \"They were going tree by tree and shooting. I saw people were dying all around. I was very quiet. I didn't cry, I didn't do anything.\"\nEventually, after three hours, she heard some voices of Israeli soldiers, and decided to make a run to safety.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Party-goers recall militant attack\nAnother witness told Channel 12 it was \"four-five hours of a horror movie... We ran like crazy, it was just crazy.\"\n\"It was a massacre,\" said Yaniv, an emergency medic who was called out to the party. He told public broadcaster Kan News: \"I've never seen anything like it in my life. It was a planned ambush. As people came out of the emergency exits, squads of terrorists were waiting for them there and just started picking them off.\n\"There were 3,000 people at the event, so they probably knew it. They had intelligence information.\"\nFriends and family members of missing loved ones are now desperately hoping to find them.\nAmong those missing is German tourist, Shani Louk, whose mother believes she was kidnapped. Another woman, 25-year-old Noa Argamani is believed to have been taken hostage at the festival, her family and friends say.\nNoa's friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC he was messaging her as she hid.\n\"Around 8:30 was the last message that I got from her,\" he said. Amit later saw a video on social media appearing to show her being taken captive. \"[It shows] her on a motorcycle, being taken away from her boyfriend. You can see clearly her terror going into the Gaza Strip.\"\nThe parents of 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin are also looking for their son, who was there after celebrating his birthday. They told the Jerusalem Post they received two short messages from him on Saturday morning reading: \"I love you\" and \"I'm sorry.\"\nAt least 700 Israelis have been killed since the attack began, according to the latest figures in local media. \nFighting between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants is continuing, and Israel has launched a wave of air strikes on Gaza. The strikes have killed at least 493 people, Palestinian officials say.\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

Here's what we know about the victims so far: \nNine US citizens were killed, a spokesperson for the country's National Security Council has said. \n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected, and wish those injured a speedy recovery,\" they said. \n\"We continue to monitor the situation closely and remain in touch with our Israeli partners, particularly the local authorities.\"\nThe identities of those killed have not yet been confirmed, and a number are also known to be missing. \nAmong them is Hersh Golberg-Polin, an American-Israeli dual citizen who has not been heard from since Saturday morning.\nAccording to the Jerusalem Post, he moved from California to Israel with his family at the age of seven and had finished his mandatory service in the army this April.\nSpeaking to CBS, Israel's ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog said he understood Americans were among the hostages taken, although there is not a clear number for how many. \nGlobal Affairs Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, said it is aware of reports of one Canadian having been killed and two others missing. \nBen Mizrachi, from British Columbia, is among them, CTV News reported.\nMr Mizrachi graduated from Vancouver's King David High School five years ago and had been attending an event in southern Israel, the school said.\nThe agency said there are 1,419 registered Canadians in Israel, and 492 in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza strip - but noted this registration was voluntary and likely an incomplete number of its citizens. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his \"deep condolences\". \nCanada has encouraged its citizens to register with Global Affairs Canada, and has an emergency contact number available. \nAn official has told the BBC that more than ten British citizens are feared dead or missing.\nNathanel Young, a British man serving in Israeli military, has been confirmed as having been killed. Two other British citizens - Jake Marlowe and Dan Darlington - are confirmed missing.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had assured his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu of the UK's \"steadfast support as Israel defends itself\".\nA French woman was killed and several others are missing, the French government said on Sunday.\nAn MP representing French nationals overseas, Meyer Habib, said on Monday that at least eight French people had been killed, captured or were missing.\nThe hostages may have included a 26-year-old man from Bordeaux who was at the Supernova festival in southern Israel, he said.\nTwelve Thais have been killed and another 11 kidnapped. \nAnother eight Thai nationals have been injured in the violence since Saturday, Thailand's foreign ministry said.\nIt said air force planes were on standby to fly its citizens home.\nThere are some 30,000 Thais in Israel working in agriculture, many near the Gaza border. \nNepal said 10 of its citizens had been killed. \nThe country confirmed on Sunday that they were students who had gone to Israel to work and acquire skills in an agricultural firm.\nAn additional 265 Nepali students are also working on various farms, with another 4,500 Nepalis working as caregivers.\nGerman-Israeli woman Shani Louk is believed to have been taken from the Supernova festival, and it is not clear if she is alive. \n\"My daughter, Shani Nicole Luke, a German citizen, was kidnapped along with a group of tourists,\" said her mother Ricarda Louk, in a video following the incident.\nGermany's Foreign Ministry also said it had to assume that German's were among those kidnapped by Hamas, and that it believed those people were also Israeli citizens. \nThe country's Prime Minister Hun Manet has confirmed one student has been killed. \nA Beijing-born Chinese Israeli woman called Noa Argamani is among those taken from the Supernova festival, according to the Israeli Embassy in China.  \nThe embassy has published a video of what it claims to be the abduction. \nThree people are missing and one injured. \nThe country's foreign ministry said on Sunday three dual Brazilian-Israeli nationals were missing after attending the music festival and a fourth was being treated in hospital.\nThe country's government said two of its nationals are missing, without giving further details. There are reports in its national media that a couple has been killed. \nForeign Minister Alicia Barcena wrote on social media that two Mexicans have been taken hostage, and did not give further details. \nKim Danti, a 22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman, is unaccounted for. \nRTÉ, the country's national broadcaster, reports that she was last seen at the music festival. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Irish Embassy in the country was dealing with it. \nThere is an Irish emergency response team, and citizens are encouraged to contact the embassy in Tel Aviv.  \nTanzania's embassy in Israel is trying to trace two Tanzanian students who were on a business studies internship.\nAmbassador Alex Kallua said his mission has been been in contact with approximately 350 Tanzanians around the country, most of them students.\n'My wife and children have been kidnapped by Hamas'\nWhat is happening in Israel, and why now?\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

The UN's humanitarian agency, OCHA, has also warned of fuel supplies lasting a matter of days. \nEven before the latest restrictions, residents of Gaza already faced widespread food insecurity, restrictions on movement and water shortages.\nOn Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it would impose a \"complete siege\" on the territory. \n\"No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed,\" he said, adding that \"we are fighting animals and are acting accordingly.\"\nThe Israeli infrastructure minister later ordered the immediate cut-off of water supplies to Gaza, saying: \"What was in the past will no longer be in the future.\"\nIn a statement released before those announcements, the Palestinian health ministry said hospitals were facing a shortage of medicines, medical supplies and fuel due to Israel's actions. \nIt called on international actors to urge Israel to \"restart power lines\" and to supply emergency needs in the form of medicine, fuel and power generators. \nIsrael has launched massive retaliatory air strikes into Gaza since Saturday, killing at least 511 people and injuring 2,750, according to the Palestinian health ministry. \nSunday night saw a particularly heavy barrage of strikes, potentially the biggest Gaza has experienced in years - throughout the night several loud bangs could be heard in quick succession across the Gaza Strip. \nAs the strikes continued after dawn, black smoke filled the sky, and the dust from collapsed buildings could be tasted in the air.\nSome of the strikes targeted the border area in the east of Gaza, from where Hamas launched their attacks on Saturday morning. Israel appears to be targeting those areas to try and shore up security there. \nThere have also been reports from witnesses of Israel using artillery fire in the border area. \nIsrael said it is striking Hamas targets in Gaza, but there are reports of civilians being hit. \nThe Palestinian Ministry of Foreign affairs said two refugee camps in Gaza - Al-Shati (also known as the Beach camp) and Jabalia camps - were hit by Israeli airstrikes, reportedly leaving several injured and dead. \nVideo shared online from Jabalia showed widespread chaos, including a body being carried away and a man covered in blood and dust.\nThe foreign ministry also said air strikes hit a United Nations school in Gaza that was housing hundreds of civilians, including children and the elderly. \nThe UN confirmed the attack, saying the school was \"severely damaged\", but that no one was killed. \nThere have also been reports of a mosque, as well as homes, being hit. \nAccording to Associated Press, 19 members of the same family were killed in a strike in Rafah, in the south of Gaza. \nThe UN said on Monday 123,538 people in Gaza have been internally displaced, mostly \"due to fear, protection concerns and the destruction of their homes\". \nThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) added that 73,000 people are sheltering in schools.\nGaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliates with strikes\nBowen: Israel blindsided by most serious attack in a generation\nWhat we know about Israeli hostages taken by Hamas\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is Hamas, what is happening in Israel and Gaza Strip, and other questions", "date": "2023-10-09 12:38:58", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: A day of violence and fear\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas has launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, with its fighters entering communities near the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of residents and taking dozens of hostages.\nHere's what you need to know about the people and places involved - and the essential context to understand this story.\nHamas is a Palestinian militant group which rules the Gaza Strip. It is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power in Gaza in 2007. \nIn between those wars, it has fired or allowed other groups to fire thousands of rockets at Israel, and carried out other deadly attacks. Israel has also repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, and, together with Egypt, has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007, for what it says is its security. \nHamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Hamas is backed by Iran, which funds it and provides weapons and training.\nThe Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is home to about 2.3 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. \nIsrael controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline and restricts who and what goods are allowed in and out through its border crossings. Similarly, Egypt controls who passes in and out through its border with Gaza. \nAbout 80% of the population of Gaza depends on international aid, according to the UN, and about one million people rely on daily food aid.\nThe West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of land known as Palestine since Roman times. \nThese were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by Jews as their ancient homeland. \nIsrael was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  \nAlthough the attack by the militants on 7 October came without warning, it happened at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions. \nThis year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel with a spectacular attack. Hamas might also have been seeking to score a major propaganda victory against Israel to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians. \nThe fact that it has taken so many Israelis captive is likely to be aimed at pressuring Israel to free some of the about 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons - a highly emotive issue for all Palestinians. \nThere is also speculation that the attack was orchestrated by Iran - Israel's arch-foe - which has been trading a growing number of attacks with Israel in recent years. Israel has blamed Iran, though Iran's ambassador the UN has denied his country's involvement.\nIran and Hamas also staunchly oppose the growing prospect of a historic peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia - something which might be thwarted if Israel's military response to the attacks provokes widespread anger in the Arab world.\nAs our International Editor Jeremy Bowen writes, this is the most ambitious operation Hamas has ever launched from Gaza and the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.\nMilitants breached the wire that separates Gaza from Israel in multiple places.\nThe unprecedented attack came a day after the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 that started a major Middle East war. The significance of the date will not have been lost on the Hamas leadership.\nYes, says our security correspondent Frank Gardner. With the combined efforts of Shin Bet, Israeli domestic intelligence, Mossad, its external spy agency and all the assets of the Israel Defense Forces, he says it is frankly astounding that nobody saw this coming or failed to act on it if they did have a warning.\nIsrael has arguably the most extensive and well-funded intelligence services in the Middle East, with informants and agents inside Palestinian militant groups, as well as in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere.\nOn the ground, along the tense border fence between Gaza and Israel there are cameras, ground-motion sensors and regular army patrols.\nThe barbed-wire topped fence is supposed to have been a \"smart barrier\" to prevent exactly the sort of infiltration that has taken place in this attack. Yet the militants of Hamas simply bulldozed their way through it, cut holes in the wire or entered Israel from the sea and by paraglider.\nHamas militant commander Mohammed Deif has called on Palestinians and other Arabs to join the militants' operation to \"sweep away the [Israeli] occupation\".\nA big question now is whether Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem or elsewhere in the region will heed his call, says our Jerusalem correspondent Yolande Knell.\nIsrael undoubtedly sees the potential for a war that could open up on multiple fronts. A worst-case scenario is that it could draw in the powerful Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah. On Sunday morning, Hezbollah launched a number of missiles and shells at northern Israel, without causing casualties.\nThe Israeli military has ordered a massive reinforcement of troops. As well as its intense air raids on Gaza, it has indicated that it is planning a ground operation there.\nIsrael 'at war' after 250 die in attack from Gaza\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "How Hamas staged Israel lightning assault no-one thought possible", "date": "2023-10-08 17:47:22", "text": "Many Israelis would have been asleep when it began.\nSaturday was the Jewish Sabbath and also a holy festival day, meaning families were planning to spend time at home together or in synagogue, and friends were meeting up.\nBut out of the dawn sky, a hail of rockets signalled the start of an attack that was unprecedented in its scale and co-ordination.\nFor years, Israel has fortified the barrier between itself and the small Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Within hours, its impenetrability was exposed as flawed.\nBBC News has been analysing footage taken by militants and civilians on the ground to piece together how Hamas co-ordinated their most sophisticated attack ever from Gaza.\nAt around 06:30 local time, the rockets began to fly.\nThe Islamist militant organisation - which controls Gaza and is designated as a terrorist group in the UK and elsewhere around the world - uses this tactic frequently.\nThe rudimentary rockets often struggle to evade Israel's advanced Iron Dome missile defence system - but thousands were fired in a short space of time to overwhelm it.\nThe scale suggests months of planning and stockpiling. Hamas says it fired 5,000 in the first round (Israel says it was half that number).\nAir raid sirens began to sound as far afield as Tel Aviv - 60km (38 miles) from Gaza - and western Jerusalem and smoke was seen rising above towns where there had been direct hits. \nAs the rockets continued to launch, fighters were gathering where they planned to penetrate the heavily fortified Gaza barrier.\nAlthough Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, it still controls its airspace, shared border and shoreline.\n As well as regular military patrols around the perimeter - which is a concrete wall in some places and a fence in others - there is also a network of cameras and sensors to prevent incursions.\nBut within hours, the barrier had been breached again and again.\nSome Hamas fighters tried to bypass the barrier completely, including by flying over it on paragliders (unverified footage showed at least seven drifting above Israel) and by boat.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said they had repelled two Hamas attempts to cross into Israel by landing vessels on the beach.\nBut what sets this attack apart is the several co-ordinated, direct assaults on barrier crossing points. \nAt 05:50 local time, a Telegram account associated with Hamas's armed wing posted the first images from the ground, taken at Kerem Shalom - the most southern of Gaza's crossings.\nThey showed militants overrunning a checkpoint and the bloodied bodies of two Israeli soldiers on the ground.\nAnother image showed at least five motorbikes, each carrying two militants armed with rifles, passing through a hole which had been cut in the wire fence section of the barrier.\nAt a less guarded section, a bulldozer was seen demolishing a stretch of barbed wire-topped fencing. \nDozens of seemingly unarmed people were gathered there, and some began to run through the gap.\nAt Erez - the furthest north of the Gaza crossings, around 43.4km (27 miles) from Kerem Shalom - Hamas was swarming another crossing. \nFootage was posted on one of the group's propaganda channels. It shows an explosion at the concrete barrier, which served as a signal to start the assault, and a militant can then be seen waving a group of fighters towards the blast site.\nEight men in bulletproof vests and carrying rifles run towards the heavily fortified checkpoint and fire at Israeli troops.\nThis video can not be played\nMilitants attack Israel/Gaza border crossing point in propaganda footage\nLater in the video, the bodies of Israeli soldiers are seen lying on the floor as the militants go from room to room sweeping the compound, clearly organised and trained.\nGaza has seven official crossings - six are controlled by Israel, one into Egypt is controlled by Cairo.\nBut within the space of a few hours, Hamas had found ways to enter Israeli territory along the length of the barrier.\nHamas fighters swept out of Gaza in all directions. We now know from the Israeli authorities that they assaulted 27 different locations, seemingly with orders to kill on sight.\nThe furthest Hamas penetrated was the town of Ofakim, which lies 22.5km (14 miles) east of Gaza. The map below shows the different areas they reached.\nIn Sderot, militants were seen standing on the back of a pick-up truck being driven through the town, which lies around 3km (1.8 miles) to the east of Gaza.\nAround a dozen armed fighters were seen fanning out through the empty streets of Ashkelon, just to the north of the Erez crossing which had just been stormed.\nSimilar scenes were repeated across southern Israel and civilians were told by the military to hide indoors.\nAt a music festival near Re'im, gunmen fired at will at a large group of young people who had gathered in the desert.\nAn eyewitness told the BBC how the militants were driving around a van loaded with weapons and spent three hours searching the area for other Israelis to target.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: A day of violence and fear\nWe now know that hostages were taken from the festival and other locations and transported back into Gaza. Israel says 100 people - soldiers and civilians - have been abducted.\nFootage taken in the town of Be'ri and verified by the BBC shows around four civilians being forcibly led away by militants.\nSeveral videos have circulated online of Israelis, some of them heavily injured, being paraded through Gaza's crowded streets.\nOther unverified atrocities too graphic to publish were captured on camera, including a motorist being dragged from his car and having his throat slashed, and the bodies of dead civilians and soldiers being defiled.\nAs well as targeting Israeli communities, Hamas also attacked two military sites: a base at Zikim and another at Re'im.\nFootage taken from near Re'im shows the aftermath, with several burned-out cars scattered along the road to the base.

Explosions continued throughout Sunday.\nThe sound was terrifying. Clouds of black smoke engulfed buildings across the Gaza Strip. \nThe Israeli army says it has hit more than 1,000 targets in Gaza. These include military positions, the homes of the Hamas's leaders, as well as banks run by the militant group. \nOne of the more significant Israeli strikes on Sunday morning targeted the Watan Tower, which serves as a hub for internet providers in Gaza.\nPalestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes on Gaza.\nMost areas are without electricity as Israel has stopped supplying Gaza with power. Gaza's own supplier can only provide 20% of the electricity needed. \nFood and water supplies have also been cut.\nDriving through the Gaza city centre on Sunday morning, I saw rubble blocking roads. Shops were closed, except for a few bakeries where long queues had formed.\nThe escalation has made Gaza's dreadful humanitarian situation even worse.\nIts under-equipped hospitals - which at the best of times struggle to provide healthcare to a population of more than two million people - have launched desperate appeals for blood donors.\nMahmoud Shalabi, Gaza director of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, described the city's main hospital as a \"slaughterhouse\".\nMany people were lying on the ground in the emergency department, he said. \"There were many dead bodies in the morgue and many medical staff were unable to cope with the huge influx of casualties they were receiving,\" Mr Shalabi added.\nThis video can not be played\nMissile strikes next to BBC Gaza rooftop base\nLater on Sunday, residents in one part of Gaza City received SMS messages from the Israeli army advising them to go to shelter ahead of strikes.\nMore than 20,000 people made their way to United Nations sites in the area, a UN representative told the BBC.\nHamas, which has controlled Gaza for the past 17 years, knows the consequences of attacking Israel - so it must have been expecting such massive retaliatory strikes.\nThe Iran-backed group has made clear that it is prepared for a war with Israel. Hamas has said it has been smuggling weapons despite the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and developing its own arsenal.\nThe group has vowed to continue what it calls \"retaliatory attacks\".  After a pause on Saturday night, it said it had fired 100 rockets at the southern Israeli town of Sderot. \nOrdinary Gazans have expressed mixed feelings about this unprecedented conflict. Although some saw Hamas' rocket attacks as a cause for celebrations, many are worried that the violence will continue for a very long time.\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

He said fighter jets would also be sent.\nFurther military aid to Israel would be sent in the coming days, the White House said, adding that the US was working to ensure Israel's enemies did not try to seek advantage from the situation.\nThe large deployment reflects American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region. \nIn particular, the US is eager to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the conflict. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas. \nIran's President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the Hamas attack, saying Israel needed to be held to account for endangering the region.  \nHamas has said assistance from Iran helped it carry out its attack, which involved rockets, drones and militants on paragliders and saw hundreds of fighters break through Israeli border fortifications around the Gaza Strip.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not seen evidence of direct Iranian involvement, but that Iran had been helping the Gaza-based group for years.\n\"Hamas wouldn't be Hamas without the support that it's gotten over many years from Iran. We haven't yet seen direct evidence that Iran was behind this particular attack or involved. But the support over many years is clear,\" he told US TV.\nAt a UN Security Council meeting, Iran denied involvement in the attack on Israel.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: A day of violence and fear\nHundreds of people are still reported missing.

{"title": "Israel blindsided, says Jeremy Bowen", "date": "2023-10-07 16:33:39", "text": "Israel was taken by surprise by the most ambitious operation Hamas has ever launched from Gaza.\nThe scale of what's been happening is unprecedented. Hamas breached the wire that separates Gaza from Israel in multiple places in the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.\nIt came a day after the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 that started a major Middle East war. The significance of the date will not have been lost on the Hamas leadership.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is at war and will exact a heavy price from its enemies.\nVideos and photos of dead Israelis, civilians as well as soldiers, are all over social media.\nOther videos of armed men from Hamas hauling soldiers and civilians into captivity in Gaza have enraged and alarmed Israelis.\nWithin hours Israel was responding with air strikes into Gaza, killing many Palestinians. Its generals will be planning a ground operation next.\nThe presence of Israeli hostages there means it will be even more complicated than previous incursions.\nFor months, it has been clear that there was a deepening risk of an explosion between Palestinian armed groups and Israel. How and where it happened was a total surprise, outside the armed wing of Hamas.\nIsraelis and Palestinians have been focusing on the West Bank, the territory between Jerusalem and the Jordanian border that Israel has occupied since 1967, where there has been almost continuous confrontation and violence throughout the year.\nArmed Palestinians, especially those operating out of the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus, have attacked Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.\nThe Israeli army has mounted dozens of raids. Armed settlers have taken the law into their own hands, with reprisals against Palestinian villages.\nExtreme religious nationalists inside Israel's right-wing government have repeated their claim that the occupied territories, in their entirety, are Jewish land.\nNo one expected Hamas to conceive and meticulously plan such a complex and coordinated operation out of Gaza.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Video purportedly shows captured Israeli tank in Gaza\nRecriminations have already started in Israel about the failure of its intelligence services to see what was coming. Israelis expect that an extensive network of informers, agents and high-tech surveillance will do its job.\nIn the end, Israeli intelligence was blindsided by the Hamas operation, which came when Israelis were relaxing or praying during the weekend of a religious holiday.\nHamas has said it acted because of threats to Jerusalem's mosques. During the last week, some Jews have prayed inside the Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest place for Muslims after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.\nThe same precinct is also venerated by Jews, as it was the site of the biblical Jewish temple. Prayer by religious Jews on what they call the Temple Mount might not sound like much, but it is prohibited by Israel as Palestinians consider it highly provocative.\nEven so, by the standards of Jerusalem, always a tinderbox of national and religious conflict, it was not exceptionally tense.\nThe complexity of the Hamas operation shows that it had been planned over months. It was not a hasty response to events in Jerusalem in the last week or so.\nThe reasons why Hamas and Israel are once again at war run much deeper. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has been heating up even when it is far from the headlines of international news organisations.\nEven so, it has been largely ignored by countries that still officially call for peace via a two-state solution, shorthand for an independent Palestine alongside Israel. For a while, during the Oslo peace process of the 1990s, the prospect of two states was a real hope. Now it is an empty slogan.\nThe Palestinian-Israeli conflict has not been a priority for President Joe Biden's administration in Washington DC. It has been trying to find a way to offer security guarantees to Saudi Arabia in return for a rapprochement with Israel.\nThe last American attempt to relaunch a peace process failed a decade ago, during the administration of President Barack Obama.\nAt the heart of the trouble is the intractable and unresolved century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan. These rapidly-escalating events prove once again that the conflict cannot simply be managed. When it is left to fester, violence and bloodshed are guaranteed.\nIsrael 'at war' after 250 die in attack from Gaza\nHow did Israeli intelligence fail to stop major attack?\n'I hear their voices, they're banging on the door'\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Footage showed partygoers running for their lives.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Party-goers recall militant attack\nAfter her partner had driven to find her, Gili Yoskovich told the BBC how she had hidden from the heavily armed fighters among trees. \"They were going tree by tree and shooting everywhere. From two sides and I saw people were dying all around.\"\n\"I said, 'OK, I'm going to die, it's OK, just breathe, just close your eyes', because [there] was shooting everywhere. It was very, very close to me.\"\nIsrael HaYom newspaper quoted Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be'eri, speaking of her fears for her father who had gone to a safe room after sirens went off to warn of incoming rocket fire. \n\"He wrote to me that the terrorists are in the shelter, I see his picture on Telegram from inside Gaza. I still hear bursts of gunfire,\" she said.\nMany Israelis have expressed shock that the Israeli security forces did not come more quickly to help them. Meanwhile, footage shared on Hamas channels showed that soldiers in Israeli army posts and in a tank had been captured or killed.\nThere were initial pictures of celebrations in Gaza where snatched Israeli military vehicles were driven through the streets.  \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Video purportedly shows captured Israeli tank in Gaza\n\"I am happy with what Hamas has done so far, taking revenge for Israeli actions at al-Aqsa,\" a young man in Gaza City told the BBC, referring to the recent rise in Jewish visitors to the compound in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem during the high holidays.\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam and is also the holiest place for Jews, known as Temple Mount.\nStill, the man who was leaving his apartment after warnings that the Israeli military was set to hit nearby, expressed fear for what would happen next. \n\"We're worried, already my family lost our shop when the Shorouk Tower was hit by Israel in the war of 2021,\" he said. \"The action Hamas has taken this time is far bigger, so there will be an even bigger Israeli response.\"\nPalestinian hospitals have already been overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli air strikes which have caused wide destruction.\nThe Gaza Strip - a tiny coastal enclave which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians - was taken over by Hamas in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections. Israel and Egypt then tightened their blockade of the territory.\nIt remains impoverished with unemployment at around 50%.\nAfter the serious conflict between Israel and Hamas in 2021, indirect talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the UN helped secure thousands of permits for Gazans to work in Israel and relax other restrictions in return for relative quiet.\nLast month, when hundreds of Palestinians began to join protests by the perimeter fence in the strip in a reminder of the mass demonstrations which began five years ago, it was assumed that this was with the nod from Hamas and was meant to squeeze more concessions from Israel and aid money from Qatar.\nThe small rallies now seem like a red herring. Some speculate whether they were in fact a chance to survey the fence ahead of the infiltration.\nWith this latest operation, Hamas seems keen to burnish its credentials once again as a militant organisation. Its charter remains committed to the destruction of Israel.\nSpeaking at the start of the offensive, the shadowy Hamas militant commander, Mohammed Deif called on Palestinians and other Arabs to join the action to \"sweep away the [Israeli] occupation\".\nA big question now is whether Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem or elsewhere in the region will heed his call. \nIsrael undoubtedly sees the potential for a war that could open up on multiple fronts. \nA worst-case scenario is that it could draw in the powerful Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah.\nMeanwhile, the Israeli military has ordered a massive reinforcement of troops. As well as its intense air raids on Gaza, it has indicated that it is planning a ground operation there.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Massive explosion as Gaza high-rises destroyed by jets\nThe capture of Israeli soldiers and civilians, who Palestinian militants will hope to use as human shields or bargaining chips, are a serious complication.\n\"We are currently busy regaining control of the area, striking broadly and especially taking care of the area around the Gaza Strip,\" said the IDF spokesperson, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. \"We will do a very sharp and thorough review.\"  \nWhile a full review may be some way off, there is no doubt that Israel's intelligence and security establishment will be asking itself how it did not see this action coming and how it did not manage to prevent its huge consequences.\n'I hear their voices, they're banging on the door'\nHow did Israeli intelligence fail to stop major attack?\nMore than 250 bodies found at site of Israeli Supernova festival - rescuers\nIsrael 'at war' after 250 die in attack from Gaza\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Israel tries to clear seized areas as PM warns of 'long war'", "date": "2023-10-08 16:09:03", "text": "Israeli security forces are carrying out operations to rescue hostages taken by Palestinian militants from Gaza and clear areas they seized on Saturday.\nThe military said troops had secured 22 locations by Sunday morning but were still sweeping through another eight.\nThe surprise attack by hundreds of gunmen from Hamas, under the cover of intense rocket fire, has reportedly killed at least 600 people in Israel.\nMore than 370 people in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes.\nAnd 400 Palestinian gunmen have been killed and dozens arrested during the fighting in Israel, according to the Israeli military.\nSaturday saw Israel's deadliest day of violence since the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday night that Israel was going into a \"long and difficult war\". He also warned Hamas, which governs Gaza, that its hideouts would be reduced to \"rubble\".\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said it was on the \"verge of a great victory\".\nThe attack began just after dawn on Saturday, which was the Jewish Sabbath and festival of Simchat Torah. \nHamas gunmen cut through the heavily fortified fence that lines Gaza's perimeter and crossed into southern Israel on motorbikes, paragliders and by sea.\nAn Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said the militants numbered in the high hundreds, while more than 3,000 rockets were fired towards cities and towns across Israel throughout the day.\n\"They attacked dozens of Israeli communities and IDF bases and went door to door,\" Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said Saturday night. \"They executed Israeli civilians in cold blood in their homes and then continued to drag into Gaza Israeli civilians and military personnel.\"\nIsrael's health ministry has not officially confirmed how many people have been killed, but Israeli TV channels reported that the death toll had passed 600 and the same figure was included in a Facebook post from the Government Press Office. \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Israeli forces exchange fire on road near Gaza border\nOvernight, Israeli security forces rescued many people who had been held hostage - almost 50 were in the dining area of one small community. \nAt least 10 militants who had taken over the police station in the town of Sderot were killed. \nThrough Sunday morning shootings continued in communities close to Gaza. \nNear the city of Ashkelon, Israeli forces chased several Palestinian gunmen in a stolen car, killing them in a dramatic shootout on a main road.\nThe IDF earlier told reporters that security forces had secured 22 locations but that there were still eight \"points of engagement\" where troops were going from house to house to confirm that they were \"clean or terrorism\".\nThey included Sderot and the nearby kibbutz (community) of Kfar Aza, where soldiers were said to be fighting to free another group of hostages.\nResidents who live near the Gaza frontier are also being evacuated.\nConcerns are also growing for the dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians, including women and children, who it is believed are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. \nRelatives of those missing have been asked to hand their belongings to police stations so that DNA samples can be taken. \nNoa Argamani, 25, and her boyfriend Avinatan Or were among hundreds of people partying at a rave in the fields next to Gaza when the attack began. A video posted on social media showed Ms Argamani screaming in panic as she was taken by militants into Gaza on a motorbike.\nA friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC that she sent him several messages as the attack unfolded.\n\"My first contact with Noa was around 06:30, when the [rockets] started,\" he said. \"She sent me her live location, asking for someone to save her and her boyfriend. She was hiding in a hole.\"\n\"Around 08:30 was the last message that I got from her,\" he added. \"I tried to tell her to stay low. I tried to contact the police and the military so that they would know their location and might find them.\"\n\"About half an hour later, I found that video... You can see clearly her terror.\"\nMr Netanyahu warned Hamas that Israel held it responsible for the hostages' well-being and would \"settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads\".\nHe also said the IDF would \"immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities,\" and told Gazans to leave their homes and take shelter.\nIn Gaza, the atmosphere has changed completely from Saturday morning, when many Palestinians were celebrating on the streets. People are now staying indoors, as the territory is rocked by explosions and clouds of black smoke engulf buildings. \nThe IDF said it had struck 426 targets belonging to Hamas by Sunday morning, including a compound belonging to the head of the group's intelligence department.  \nHamas said 12 houses belonging to senior leaders of the group were hit, as well as branches of its bank.\nThe multi-storey Watan Tower in Gaza City, where internet service providers that served half of the population were based, was also destroyed. \nPalestinian health ministry officials said more than 300 people, including children, had been killed in Gaza and that another 1,990 had been injured. \nAbout 20,000 people have taken shelter in UN schools and hospitals after being told by the IDF to leave their homes immediately, suggesting that they would be attacked by air soon. The Israeli warnings covered Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, and the Daraj area of Gaza City.\nThis video can not be played\nMissile strikes next to BBC Gaza rooftop base\nDr Khamis Elessi, a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant based in Gaza City, told the BBC that the situation was unbearable.\n\"Everywhere you are going in Gaza you see funerals, you see death. You see buildings collapsing. It's like you are watching a movie about the end of life on this Earth,\" he said.\n\"The kids are crying and screaming, there is no electricity, there's no internet and so you feel you could be next.\"\nIsrael's security cabinet cut off Gaza's electricity and fuel supplies and the entry of goods in retaliation for the Hamas attack. \nIn a separate development on Sunday, the IDF said its artillery had struck targets in southern Lebanon and carried out a drone strike on \"terrorist infrastructure\" in response to a rocket attack by the militant Hezbollah movement in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area. \nHezbollah said it had fired at three Israeli positions \"in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance\", despite a warning from Israel and the US for other parties not to engage and risk a regional war.\nThe Lebanese army said the Israeli retaliatory fire wounded several people, while the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon said it was working with authorities in both countries to avoid a more serious escalation.\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

I am with my two little children.\" \nIsrael has told civilians near the border to stay in shelters. But in Kibbutz Be'eri, residents said Palestinian militants were trying to get into homes and shelters.\nOne resident living in the town told Channel 12 that \"there's shooting from across the town, I'm at home and I hear them outside my house. We're sitting quietly, the entire town is quiet so they won't come for us\".\nAnd 23-year-old resident Ella said she has heard that \"the terrorists are in the shelter\", adding: \"I still hear bursts of gunfire.\"\nAll homes in Israel are required by law to have bomb shelters, and there are also bomb shelters in public places too.\nIt is one of the most serious escalations in the Israel-Palestinian conflict in years - with fighters from militant group Hamas crossing into Israel from Gaza at dawn, using motorbikes, paragliders and boats in an unprecedented assault.\nThey claim to have taken dozens of Israelis captive, while in the the town of Sderot, gunmen purportedly opened fire on residents. \nAt least 250 people are reported killed in Israel and many more wounded.\n\"I've been in the shelter with my week-old baby for over two hours, while my house is on fire,\" said one resident of Kibbutz Nirim, near to the Gaza strip, on Channel 13.\nOther residents have been putting out pleas on social media. \n\"Urgent, urgent, please help this get to the media,\" Ella Mor wrote on Facebook. \"We need to save my nephews who are in hiding. They called to say that they shot their mum and dad and they're dead in Kfar Aza. They can't find the baby girl. \n\"The police don't answer; Magen David Adom [Israel's emergency medical service] can't get to the Kibbutz.\"\nElsewhere, a woman called Adele said on Facebook: \"We have been told to lock doors, not leave the safe room. We're not even turning in the air-conditioning for fear it will signal a presence of people in the house. \n\"My stomach is turning. I hear a lot of shooting, even though the thick walls of the safe room. I need to go to the bathroom, but I dare not.

We are close to the fence, I don't know where the army is, there's no-one here.\"\nThe unprecedented attack by Hamas began early on Saturday morning, as the fighters used cover from a barrage of rockets.\nThe militants claimed to have fired thousands of rockets - with some targeting cities as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\nIsraeli author and journalist Gideon Levy, who is in Tel Aviv, told the BBC: \"The streets are totally empty. Restaurants, cafes everything is locked down and there is a heavy feeling of surprise, of shock and of fear from what is still expected to happen.\n\"When the first rockets fell, I was still jogging in the park, the noise was terrible.\"\nIsrael has launched waves of air strikes in the Gaza Strip in response.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was \"at war\" and vowed that Hamas, Gaza's rulers, will \"pay a price it has never known\".\nThe strikes on Gaza have killed more than 230 people and left many others wounded, according to local Palestinian officials.\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

{"title": "Five female MCs who changed hip-hop? Eve makes her choice", "date": "2023-10-09 01:09:05", "text": "Hip-hop can seem like a man's world, but women have been there from the start.\nThe infamous Bronx party that gave birth to the genre was organised by Cindy Campbell, a high school student who was trying to raise money for her back-to-school clothes. It was Cindy who wrote invitations on index cards and invited her brother Clive, aka DJ Kool Herc, to play the music.\nBefore long, former R&B singer Sylvia Robinson co-founded the world's first hip-hop label, Sugar Hill Records. Alongside landmark singles like Rapper's Delight, she also released one of the first all-female rap records, Funk You Up by The Sequence (featuring a then-unknown Angie Stone).\nBut as the genre became mainstream, pioneers like Roxanne Shanté, Kool Lady Rock and MC Sha-Rock were overshadowed by their male counterparts. The dawn of gangsta rap in the early 1990s turned hip-hop into even more of a boys club.\nAs the genre turns 50, a new three-part BBC documentary aims to correct the record.\nNarrated by Neneh Cherry, First Ladies of Hip-Hop acknowledges the contributions of artists like Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Rah Digga and Lil Kim, while highlighting a new generation - Ice Spice, Little Simz, Doja Cat - at the forefront of rap innovation.\nAmong them is Philadelphia-born rapper Eve, the street-tough MC who emerged as part of the Ruff Ryders posse, and went on to score major crossover hits like Who's That Girl? and Let Me Blow Ya Mind.\nWe asked her to choose five women who had changed the course of hip-hop. Here's what she said:\nQueen Latifah wasn't the first female rapper, but she was the first to become a star. With a no-nonsense, straight-talking style that emphasised feminine power and Afrocentric consciousness, her hits included U.N.I.T.Y, Ladies First and Mama Gave Birth To The Soul Children.\nWords have always been something that I've loved. From the time I was eight years old, I would always write poems. And that obviously turned into rapping. Rhythm and poetry - that's what rap is.\nQueen Latifah, MC Lyte and Salt-N-Pepa - those were the women who showed me I can do this. Any time I saw them, I felt \"yeah, that could be me\".\nBut I always felt a particular closeness to Queen Latifah, maybe because she's from Jersey and I'm from Philly, but also because I was a tomboy when I was young. I saw that toughness in her, too: she stands strong in her womanhood, but she also hangs with the boys. \nAnd lyrically, she's amazing. She talks about her pride in being a black woman and about female unity: let's stand together, we don't have to be competitive, let's celebrate each other. \nShe had such a presence. Her career has been a blueprint for me, in terms of longevity and versatility.\nLauryn Hill proved her rap credentials on Fugees tracks like Vocab and How Many Mics, but it was the uplifting blend of hip-hop, soul and reggae on her solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill that cemented her legacy. To this day, she remains the only female rapper to win the Grammy for Album of the Year.\nI love her to death. The Fugees as a whole were amazing, but having Lauryn there took them to higher heights, for sure.\nShe rapped about things outside the normal, [subjects like] heartbreak and resisting peer pressure, and for a lot of us coming up with Lauryn, we felt like she was a big sister, pulling us to one side and going \"hey, girl, watch out, you shouldn't be doing this\" or \"don't be scared of this person\". She was teaching us how to be a woman - letting us in on game, a little bit.\nShe had a very different style, a different cadence. It was almost jazzy, in a way. I refer to it as \"backpack hip-hop\", you know? The Fugees, The Roots, A Tribe Called Quest - they ride the beat in a different way.\nI kind of fought against that kind of style, because I was a battle rapper. And because I went up against dudes all the time, it was very ego driven: \"Hey, you still live with your mom and you're broke and you don't have a car and you're not well endowed.\"\nBut Lauryn was different. She educated us.\nInnovative, individual, incomparable - Missy Elliott changed the sound of hip-hop forever, with her alien beats and larger-than-life music videos. Hits like Get Ur Freak On and Work It were often imitated, but never bettered, with Missy branding her competition \"beat biters\".\nMissy took us into that pop world, that crossover world. Everything was bigger and brighter and bolder. She brought a theatrical element to hip-hop in her presentation and her videos. \nAnd what I love about Missy is that, because she had a hand in writing so many R&B songs, she's very melodic in the way that she rhymes - whereas, before her, that really wasn't done. \nShe also stood up for herself. Lines like, \"Copywritten, so don't copy me / Y'all do it sloppily\" - I love that, because men say that stuff all the time, but Missy was as cocky as they were. And she was right. She was original and she knew it.\nWe worked together several times. The Hot Boyz remix was my first foray into that world, and she sang the theme tune to my TV show. The times that we had in the studio, she'd be like \"this is what I'm thinking, here's what the track sounds like, I'll let you be\". She's not a micromanager. She's more like \"you do your thing, and I'll see you after\".\nShe's always been an incredible friend and supporter, and someone I could count on in the industry.\nOne of the fiercest wordsmiths on the planet, Nicki Minaj burst on to the scene with 2010's Pink Friday, at a time when female MCs were missing from mainstream hip-hop.  Since then, she's scored 133 hits on the Billboard chart, including Starships, Anaconda and Super Freaky Girl.\nHer wordplay is incredible. She's just a great lyricist and no-one can take her on. Anything I've ever heard her on, like that guest verse on Kanye's Monster, she's murdered it.\nShe's also very smart about the industry - knowing what's coming and capturing the moment. She's done a great job building her fanbase, the Barbz, and knowing where that generation was going. \nBeing a female rapper, or even a female pop star, it's easy to get put into a box - and sometimes you have to do drastic things to break out of that box. \nI think both Nicki and Doja Cat, who I'm a big fan of, are really pushing to be the artists they want to be, and that's dope.\nThe elusive, Brooklyn-based rapper Leikeili47 keeps her identity hidden under a ski mask, ensuring the focus remains on her dextrous, quotable lyrics.\nI was watching the HBO drama Vinyl and this song came on that I didn't recognise. I was like \"wait, who does this?\" so I Shazam-ed it, and went into this Leikeili47 deep-dive. I never looked back.\nIf you are a hip-hop head who's drawn to lyrics, and wants to hear a good story and feel something, she's amazing. \nShe doesn't reveal her identity, she just lets the bars speak for themselves. I would say she's an all-round perfect MC... I just need her to release more music!\nThe first two episodes of First Ladies of Hip-Hop are available on BBC iPlayer.

{"title": "My landlord wanted to put the rent up 35% despite cap", "date": "2023-10-09 05:14:03", "text": "Rents in Scotland have risen by more than England despite a high-profile 3% cap on increases imposed by the Scottish government earlier this year. \nCatherine Sheldon is one of thousands of young Scots struggling with the cost of living crisis who thought they would be protected from a large rent rise.\nHowever, a \"loophole\" in the Scottish government's rent cap rules allows her private landlord to seek a 35% rise because one of her flatmates gave notice to move out, ending the tenancy agreement.\nThe 26-year-old shared the three-bedroom flat in Glasgow with two friends for two-and-a-half years.\nCatherine describes the flat as her home but in order to stay living there she would have had to accept her share of the rent rising from £520 per month to £700.\nShe says her landlord's justification for the increase is that the new price is simply the market rate for the flat - and they appear to be correct.\nBut Catherine says the new rent represents more than half her monthly income.\n\"I don't see how these price increases can be sustainable for anyone,\" she told BBC Disclosure.\n\"I don't understand who is actually affording it.\"\nNegotiations to agree a new tenancy with a lesser rent rise failed and Catherine says she is now having to leave the property, with nowhere else to go that she can afford.\n\"We've basically just decided that we need to leave and find somewhere else to live,\" she said. \n\"We've been fighting this since February, and we're all just completely exhausted by the whole situation and we don't think there's anything else we can do.\"\nBut Catherine, who is a recent graduate and hospitality worker, is struggling to find anything within her price range and she says she is worried she will be forced out of Glasgow altogether.\n\"I'm really scared,\" she said. \n\"I'd move further out but all my friends and everyone I know live here.\n\"I'd be worried about being isolated from everyone. I've just been completely overwhelmed by the whole thing.\"\nOver the past decade, rents in Scotland's largest cities have almost doubled, according to exclusive data commissioned by BBC Scotland News.\nThe Rightmove research reveals that between September 2013 and September 2023, the average rent for a two-bedroom flat in Edinburgh climbed by 92% to £1,441, while in Glasgow this increased by 82% to £978.\nDespite the emergency legislation capping rent rises at 3%, private rents across Scotland have increased by 6% in the past year, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.\nThis figure is higher than London (5.9%).\nThe statistics show annual private rental costs increased by 5.5% across the UK as a whole, with England at 5.4% and Wales at 6.5%.\nEngland and Wales do not currently have any rent control legislation in place.\nIn Scotland, as the impact of cost of living rises such as energy prices began to bite last year, the Scottish government announced a temporary freeze on rent rises. \nIn April this changed to a 3% cap on increases.\nHowever, campaigners have warned the \"joint tenancy loophole\" means that, in many flat-shares, landlords are free to increase the rent by as much as they want when one person leaves.\nThis is because the emergency legislation only applies to tenancies, rather than properties. \nEconomist and co-director of think tank Future Economy Scotland, Laurie Macfarlane ,described the rent cap as a \"sticking plaster\" amid a housing crisis in Scotland that private renters are at the very sharp end of. \nHe told the BBC rent rises were outstripping the growth in incomes and people were spending more of their income than ever before on keeping a roof over their heads.\nSinead McNulty, a Living Rent organiser in Edinburgh, had spent months helping tenants fight rent increases when she was hit with one of her own.\nShe shares a four-bedroom flat and, like Catherine, was hit with a substantial rent hike when one of her flatmates needed to move out.\n\"We were shocked to find that the rent had increased by £500, which means that our rent individually each was up by £125,\" she told the BBC.\nShe says her generation is particularly vulnerable to the \"massive loophole\" in the rent cap because young people \"have no other choice but to flat-share\" due to increasing costs.\n\"People say it's because we live in the city centre, but I know from my friends and my job that wherever you are it's completely unaffordable,\" Sinead said.\n\"My friends, my colleagues, can't afford to live in the city any more. For me that's really upsetting but, more than upsetting, it makes me really angry.\n\"I am genuinely afraid of moving out of this property and spending much more money on rent and actually being homeless,\" she said.\n\"If I cannot live here anymore, I know I will struggle to find a home.\"\nLandlords are also being hit by cost of living pressures with mortgage rates rising rapidly along with the cost of complying with regulations.\nJohn Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords, said he was \"not surprised\" that some tenants were feeling exploited.\n\"I think tenants are finding it really difficult at the moment, as landlords are finding it difficult,\" he told the BBC. \n\"And I feel the government is letting all parties down here. They're not working with us to find these sustainable solutions.\"\nMr Blackwood said one solution would be \"looking at greater predictability of rents and rent increases in the future\" in a way that protects the landlord's business.\nHe added that due to a shortage of alternative affordable housing, private landlords had been asked to provide housing to many more people than they ever expected to and that it had become the \"only resort for many renters\".\n\"That's unsustainable and it's not the Scotland that we should be aspiring towards,\" he said.\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland, Housing Minister Paul McLennan said he would look at longer-term rent controls in the upcoming Housing Bill.\nHe said: \"There are obviously things we can do in terms of the short-term measures that are in place just now, but looking beyond that and looking to longer-term rent controls, obviously something like that needs to be considered.\"\nThe minister added: \"I think if you look at rents in other parts of the UK, be that London and Manchester and Newcastle, they are going up with approximately the same kind of figures.\" \n\"A lot of it comes down to supply and demand.

{"title": "RFK Jr announcement: Who would actually vote for Robert F Kennedy Jr as an independent candidate?", "date": "2023-10-09 01:46:03", "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr - the anti-vaccination activist, environmental lawyer and member of America's most-famous political family - is expected to announce on Monday that he's running for president as an independent candidate. \nAlthough his chances of capturing the White House in 2024 are slim to none, he could potentially impact a close race. So who are his supporters - and might he take more votes from the Republican or Democratic nominee? \n\"If it becomes a choice between Trump and Kennedy, that's a really tough question,\" says Sherri Guoan. \"In a perfect world, I would love for them to run together.\"\nMrs Guoan and her husband Brandon drove more than an hour from the Detroit area to see Mr Kennedy in Michigan's state capital on Saturday. \nMr Guoan calls himself an \"old school Democrat, a Kennedy Democrat.\" But the couple both voted for Donald Trump in 2020. \n\"Trump is very controversial and I think the country could use a fresh start,\" she says, but there's no way she'll vote for Joe Biden, whom she calls \"the worst president this country has ever had.\"\nThe BBC spoke to dozens of voters in an eclectic crowd of a few hundred in Lansing. They offered some clues into how a Kennedy campaign might alter the overall race - and in what direction.\nStanding just a few feet away from the Guaons is retired autoworker and proud union member Alex Hernandez. A Democrat who voted for Mr Biden, he recalls his parents taking him to see a speech by Mr Kennedy's father in 1968.\n\"He has the name and he has the heritage,\" he says of the younger Kennedy. \"I wanted to come down here and hear what he has to say.\"\nRobert F Kennedy Jr is part of a Democratic political dynasty. He counts a president and senator among his uncles, and in 1968 his father was assassinated while running for the party's presidential nomination.\nMr Kennedy began his own quest for the White House earlier this year by entering the party's nomination process. He never mounted a real challenge to President Joe Biden, however, and at a rally in Philadelphia on Monday he is expected to declare he is running as an independent candidate instead.  \nThe switch reflects how the policies and priorities of Mr Kennedy and the modern Democratic Party have diverged. His deep scepticism about vaccines and the push to support Ukraine, for example, are out of step with most Democratic politicians.\nMr Kennedy spent most of his career as an environmental lawyer but has been more recently known for spreading doubt and falsehoods about vaccinations through his foundation, Children's Health Defense, which got huge boosts in funding and publicity during the Covid pandemic. \nHis signature issue resonates more with grassroots Republican voters than with Democrats. And in a recent podcast interview, Mr Kennedy said: \"I take more votes from President Trump than I do from President Biden.\"\nA recent poll funded by a political action committee backing the Kennedy campaign indicated that in a three-way race, Mr Kennedy Jr would siphon off slightly more support from Donald Trump than from Joe Biden. However, another survey, conducted by Ipsos and Reuters, showed the opposite. \nIn his stump speech in Michigan on Saturday, Kennedy emphasised his environmental credentials, a populist economic message, and the history of his political family - only mentioning vaccines very briefly. \n\"People feel that the system is disintegrating,\" he told the crowd. \"Not just economically, but mental health and physical health, and all these communities are being torn apart in all these different ways.\n\"A lot of them are living pay cheque to pay cheque, at the edge of desperation.\"\nMany voters said they had voted for Mr Trump and preferred his policies, if not his personality. But there were no shortage of self-declared Democrats or people who said they would refuse to vote for either of the major parties. \n\"If I didn't have an option of Kennedy, I would probably just write him in,\" says Matthew Ruggles. Two of his friends standing nearby agree. \"There's no point in voting for either of those [major] parties.\"\n\"A third-party candidate can attract people who aren't interested in the other candidates - maybe they did vote in the past but they felt overlooked,\" says Melissa Smith, author of Third Parties, Outsiders, and Renegades: Modern Challenges to the Two-Party System in Presidential Elections.\nWhen it comes to the raw vote numbers, Ms Smith says, the true impact of an independent candidate can be hard to gauge, even after an election.\nIn 2020, the closest state, Georgia, was decided by just more than 11,000 votes. At the same time, more than 60,000 Georgians voted for the Libertarian Party ticket headed by Jo Jorgenson. The Libertarian vote was also greater than Joe Biden's margin of victory in the crucial states of Wisconsin and Arizona.\nBut whether in the absence of a third party those voters would have voted for Mr Trump, Mr Biden or not at all is a nearly impossible question to answer. \nAnd Ms Smith says that simple dissatisfaction with the major parties is not enough to push most voters to independent and third-party candidates. \nMr Kennedy also faces a different challenge to previous would-be disruptors of the two-party system. Because Mr Trump has already claimed the mantle of anti-establishment outsider, and reshaped the Republican Party in his populist image, there is simply less political terrain available to exploit.  \nThat is why Mr Kennedy's stance on vaccines, which for years has run contrary to the scientific mainstream, may be one issue where he stands out from the other candidates - even if he is currently avoiding focusing on it. \nMr Kennedy, Ms Smith says, \"trades in conspiracy theories and that's what's going to attract some people\" - even though Mr Trump has himself spread falsehoods about widespread election fraud.\nFor many in the crowd on Saturday, Mr Kennedy's views on vaccines were part of his appeal - a feature, rather than a bug. Several repeated debunked theories about a connection between childhood vaccines and autism, while several more mentioned their opposition to vaccine mandates, whether by the government or private companies. \n\"We're not saying vaccines aren't good. We're not saying they're bad. We just want to ask about them,\" says student Jacob Kostecke, who was wearing a Kennedy T-shirt and says he's planning on a career in the medical field.\n\"He's just trying to keep an open mind and just bring us together, where I feel like everything's just so divided and so political right now.\"\nMore than a year away from the actual presidential election in November 2024, it is impossible to know if the Kennedy campaign will catch fire or remain a fringe movement. But Jacob says if Mr Kennedy was not on the ballot, he would vote for Mr Trump. \nRFK Jr rebuked over Covid conspiracy theory\nWhy RFK Jr's campaign has avoided vaccine talk\nAnti-vaccine Kennedy to challenge Biden in 2024\nIf Robert Kennedy had not been killed...\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The young Essex carers whose help equates to a full-time job", "date": "2023-10-09 05:06:04", "text": "On schooldays, 11-year-old Flo and her sister Grace, 15, get up at 06:10 to do a string of jobs before school. The sisters are among a rapidly expanding number of young carers. What is driving this rise and is enough being done to support the children supporting others?\nThree years ago, an assessor from Essex Young Carers arrived at Flo and Grace's home and asked the girls about the chores they did.\nWhen the total hours were totted up, it emerged the girls spent about 40 hours each week between them caring for their mother, Kayleigh.\nThe sisters are part of a growing population of young carers giving more than 20 hours of weekly support to loved ones. Census data suggests there are 20,945 under-18s providing between 20 and 49 hours of care, up 7% from 19,530 in 2011.\n\"I feel a lot of guilt,\" says Kayleigh, who has albinism and is blind. \"Effectively they have a full-time job each week, just helping me.\"\nThe children's daily tasks include: \nWhile the children just accept their caring efforts as \"what they do\", Kayleigh describes her daughters as \"amazing superheroes\".\n\"There are some really low days when I just wish I was normal for them,\" says Kayleigh. \"Then again, I know I am bringing up two incredible humans.\"\nAlthough Flo and Grace have always helped their mother, the care Kayleigh needed increased dramatically during the pandemic after an eye infection stripped her of much of her remaining sight.\nThat sight loss made navigating the outside world \"such a daunting prospect\".\n\"Everything I thought I knew, I then didn't know - I was like a toddler again and needed to be taught by my young carers,\" Kayleigh says.\nThe sisters were referred to the charity Kool Carers after their primary school head teacher overheard Kayleigh mention that her daughters read the post to her.\nThe support given by the charity and the chance to meet other young carers has been transformative for the sisters.\nKayleigh says the girls became \"more accepting\" of being young carers - \"it wasn't a secret any more\".\nFriends have also been supportive, the sisters say. \n\"I don't tend to bring it up,\" says Flo. \"But if I do tell them, then they are like, 'oh okay', and it doesn't seem abnormal after that. In fact, my friends think it is quite cool.\"\nAnd despite their responsibilities and homework, Flo is heavily involved in dance and judo while Grace also does judo and is a member both of the Young Essex Assembly and the Royal Navy cadets.\nShe hopes one day to be a Royal Navy engineer.\nHelen Murphy works as a counsellor with young carers and their families.\n\"Life can be tough enough for any young person these days,\" she says. \"And when you add on their caring responsibilities it can be really quite overwhelming for them.\"\nIssues such as loneliness and a sense of isolation are common.\n\"Quite often they will come to us and say 'this is just what we do and got used to',\" she says. \"But they will have quite complex emotions about it. \n\"They might feel angry or feel it is unfair but cannot really express that to the parent or parents they are caring for.\n\"We provide them with the space and time to express those quite natural feelings.\"\nThe number of young carers known to Essex County Council has risen from 2,482 in 2021 to 3,577 at the most recent count. \nThe council claims the rise is largely down to schools and other organisations being better at identifying young carers.  \nChris Vince, the young carers service manager at Harlow-based Action for Young Carers, says he has noticed an \"increase in mental health issues caused by the cost-of-living crisis\" which in turn had led to a rise in referrals.\nRachel Tungate, the founder of Kool Carers, suggests the pandemic itself has increased the number of young carers, particularly in terms of adults with complex mental health needs.\n\"We've noticed a massive increase in the number of young carers,\" she says. \"Before the pandemic we were supporting 48 young carers aged eight to 18.\n\"We're now supporting 153 young carers and their families, which equates to more than 500 people, and we've got a waiting list of 87 young people.\n\"As a society, I think we are all falling short - too many young carers are still below the radar.\"\nAsked whether there was enough support out there for young carers, Ms Tungate says: \"Absolutely not. We need to ensure they feel comfortable about identifying themselves as young carers and that the support is out there for when they do.\"\nSome young carers, she says, are missing out on education or training because of their caring responsibilities.\n\"We are seeing some young carers who don't go on to reach their full potential academically because they want to stay at home and care for their loved ones,\" Ms Tungate says.\n\"They are incredibly selfless.\"\nYoung carer Kerri Foster, 19, lives in Basildon and desperately wants to go to university to study design.\nBut her family cannot afford for her to go, she says.\nHer father has the neurodegenerative disorder Gordon Holmes Syndrome which has increasingly reduced his mobility. Her mother gave up work a couple of years ago to care for her husband.\n\"It is not really feasible for me at the moment,\" she says about her studies.\nInstead, she has taken a full-time job in her home town to both support herself and her parents. \nShe says she will reassess whether or not she can go to university in a couple of years' time.\nMark Durham, the county council cabinet member responsible for the youth service, says the Essex Young Carers Service was \"proactively engaging with young people and identifying more young carers\".\n\"We are committed to helping them to feel supported too,\" he says.\n\"We work to ensure activities are age and gender appropriate, and that the role of young carers is acknowledged with their achievements celebrated.\n\"We aim to ensure young carers are not disadvantaged due to their caring role and have the same opportunities as their peers to enjoy life and fulfil their ambitions.\"\nPhotography: Laurence Cawley\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

{"title": "Adam Kay: Social media hides reality of parenthood, says writer and comedian", "date": "2023-10-09 00:53:41", "text": "This Is Going to Hurt author and ex-doctor Adam Kay is shattered, which is hardly surprising - he's just been mopping up baby vomit and is clearly sleep-deprived.\nHe's most famous for his best-selling medical diaries, which drew back the curtain on the tough realities of being a doctor. \nBut right now, he's way more preoccupied with juggling his two babies, who are very close in age.\nKay and his husband, Games of Thrones producer James Farrell, share Ruby, aged 10 months, and Ziggy, six months, whom they had via surrogates. \nThey're having a steep learning curve - several in fact, as all new parents do.\nHe and Farrell do bottle feeds and nappies on alternate nights, in the hope of preserving some sleep while also working. \nKay's no stranger to being jolted into alertness at 4am, having been a junior doctor on an obstetrics ward until 2010.\nWhile he's no longer delivering babies in the small hours, he admits to being a bit unprepared for parenthood.  \n\"Going into the kitchen and putting the bright lights on, boiling the kettle and all that, it makes you 100% awake,\" he correctly observes.\nMuch like the realities of being a doctor, he's found that some of the glowing images of parenthood are perhaps a tad over-optimistic.\n\"I think if you're on Instagram, it's quite possible to have parenthood slightly mis-sold to you,\" he says. \n\"There are these people who say 'I wouldn't change a thing'.\n\"And that's really stuck with me - like you wouldn't change waking up at night? You wouldn't change the nappies? You wouldn't change not going out at night?\n\"So l dispute 'I wouldn't change a thing'. There's loads that I would change,\" he laughs. \n\"It disrupts your life more than anything else you can possibly imagine. However the net benefit is still enormous, because what they give back is absolutely amazing. \n\"But I wish someone had sat me down beforehand. Maybe I'm the outlier. I'm the idiot who failed to realise the realities.\"\nHe is, of course, using comedy to make a serious point, and there are plenty of online influencers who talk about the tough side of parenting. \nBut Kay specialises in distilling both the funny and poignant moments from whatever he is talking about, having done this as a writer and stand-up comedian.\nHis latest live show, Undoctored, is based on his hugely successful book of the same name. \nIt follows 2017's This Is Going to Hurt, about his experiences of being a junior doctor on an NHS labour ward. More than three million copies were sold, and it was dramatised on BBC One, winning Ben Whishaw, who played Kay, a best actor Bafta.  \nUndoctored shares more eye-watering anecdotes from his life as a medic, but is also about Kay's life beyond the NHS. \nHe turned it into another stage show, taking it to this year's Edinburgh Fringe, performing his first full season since 2016. It was the most popular of the festival's 3,500 shows, selling more than 23,000 tickets, with 32 sell-out performances.\n\"It was just a wonderful moment,\" he says. \"I love the Fringe very much and it means a lot to me. All of my success has been down to the Fringe in 2016, before the book, when I read out from my diaries.\"\nA friend brought a guest to see him perform, and that guest happened to be a book editor, who asked Kay if he had more diaries. This ultimately led to his first book.\n\"So for me, the Fringe was this most amazing springboard, which it has been for lots of people,\" he adds, although he feels it has \"changed since the last time I was up\".\n\"I don't think it's really open access any more because of the costs of going up and the big multiplex venues, which are so expensive to perform at. \n\"I had a wonderful month but I sort of did feel it was a different Fringe.\" \nUK Theatre Web said of Undoctored that \"Adam's style of songs and stories works excellently, a sort of cross between a stand-up and a lecture\". Edinburgh Festivals Magazine added: \"Don't be fooled - it's not all laughs. Kay gets serious about mental health in the NHS, sharing heart-wrenching stories and advocating for change.\" \nAlthough the show does have plenty of laughs and musical numbers, he warns the audience it's not all going to be funny.\nHe talks about how some doctors \"bottle everything up\" emotionally, saying: \"I suspect it partly comes down to the idea that patients don't want their doctors to be too human because humans make mistakes. \n\"So in a way you get trained to put up these shields, put up a front to maybe protect yourself, but it does the opposite of protecting you. \n\"Because if you push stuff away into a box, all this bad stuff that happens, that box will always open, and you have no control whatsoever over when that happens.\"\nHe left the profession after a traumatic incident at work left him with PTSD and nightmares. \nKay talks in his show about how crucial it is that the NHS \"remembers staff are human beings\" by taking care of their mental health, and prioritising retaining staff. He also supports doctors striking for more pay. \nBut what would he say to anyone telling him he should not have exposed the negative aspects of his job, and just got on with it?\n\"When This Is Going to Hurt came out, I got an almost universally positive reaction,\" he says. \"But I also had probably between 10 and 20 messages from old-school doctors saying, 'What did you think was gonna happen? Toughen up, man up and grow a pair'.\n\"And I just thought, I've done that. I've definitely done the right thing.\"\nAs well as leaving medicine and publishing his diaries, Kay has also turned his hand to writing children's books, which, unsurprisingly, are full of revolting and hilarious facts. \nHis first two, Kay's Anatomy and Kay's Marvellous Medicine, have been translated into 29 languages and sold 500,000 copies. \nBook number three, Kay's Incredible Inventions, is aimed at inspiring \"the next generation of scientists and inventors\".\nA \"guide to inventions that changed the world (and some that definitely didn't)\", it covers topics from the unsavoury history of bottom wiping to how Velcro was invented. \nKay wrote it in the same style as his other works, which is to \"draw people in with the funny, and then hopefully say something useful\".\nHe also visits schools to talk about his books, and says he gets messages from parents saying they have \"really resonated with kids who are reluctant readers, including some who are neurodivergent, which is just amazing\". \nOne thing that delights him is adding in \"sneaky schoolwork, from history to every part of science\", so children learn without realising it.\n\"I had a message from a surgeon who was having breakfast with her son and he started talking to her about gallstones, and she said 'Are you reading my medical journals?'.\n\"He had been reading my book. I find it so rewarding.\" \nUndoctored is at London's Lyric theatre from 23 to 28 October and The Lowry, Salford, on 8 November. Kay's Incredible Inventions, published by Puffin, is out in hardback on 14 November. \nSuicide warning from This Is Going To Hurt creator\nBen Whishaw on a best seller, Bond and a Bear\nPolice escort man from Adam Kay gig after mask row\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

That would have freed up cash so it could go out and continue to grow its business.\nBut regulators turned down the request last month, saying that they wanted the bank to use an external rating system for now.\nReports emerged last week saying Metro Bank was looking to raise money from investors, lenders and possibly considering selling some of its mortgages before it needs to refinance some of its debts.\nAlthough it has been successful in winning 2.7 million customers, analysts said that - like other banks - it might have found it tricky to make money in the past few years when interest rates were at historic lows.\nLate on Sunday, the bank put out a statement saying it had struck a deal with investors, raising £325m in new funding, as well as refinancing £600m of debt. Its chief executive said the deal marked \"a new chapter\" for the troubled lender.\nPrior to that, the BBC understands Treasury officialshad been in touch with the Prudential Regulation Authority, the financial services regulator, which is monitoring the situation at the bank.\nMetro Bank's share price started to slide last month after the decision by the Bank of England not to allow the bank to use its own internal measures to work out the risks attached to its mortgages.\nThen, after the reports last week that it was looking to raise money, its shares tumbled by as much as 30% on Thursday, hitting lows of about 34p per share. \nThe shares recovered some ground on Friday, and rose further on Monday morning to about 56p after the announcement of the rescue deal.\nHowever, the bank's stock market value is now less than £100m, whereas it was valued at about £3.5bn at its peak five years ago.\nAnalysts suggested that the reports it could be looking to raise money through selling new shares might have spooked investors. \nThe lower the share price is, the more shares that Metro Bank needs to sell and the bigger the hit to existing shareholders, which can \"become a bit of a vicious circle\", Mr Mould told the BBC's Today programme.\nAnalysts are also on high alert for any problems in the banking sector following the collapse of US banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March this year. \nThey marked the two biggest bank failures in the US since the financial crisis of 2008 and their collapse sparked fears about the wider strength of the sector.\nMetro Bank is operating as normal and does not face any immediate threat.\nCustomer deposits up to £85,000 are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees that if a bank runs into trouble, depositors will get their money back up to that level.\nThat guarantee would cover the vast bulk of Metro Bank's £15.5bn in customer deposits.\nThe bank has confirmed it is looking at selling up to £3bn of its residential mortgages to other banks. However, homeowners don't face any immediate change. Some customers might end up having their loans managed by another bank in the future.\nMetro Bank is a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange.\nThis means that its shares are sold to the public who become part owners, or shareholders, in the business.\nMetro Bank's biggest shareholder is Spaldy Investments. It is an investment vehicle owned by Colombian billionaire investor Jaime Gilinski Bacal, who built one of the biggest banking empires in Latin America.\nAs part of the rescue deal, Spaldy Investments will sink £102m into the bank, increasing Mr Bacal's stake from 9% to 53%.\nMetro Bank shares plunge on fund raising reports\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Sarah Sunny: How India's first deaf lawyer made history in Supreme Court", "date": "2023-10-08 22:01:53", "text": "Last week, Sarah Sunny made history after she became India's first deaf lawyer to argue in the country's Supreme Court. \nThe 27-year-old first appeared before Chief Justice DY Chandrachud in September after the court made an exception and allowed a sign language interpreter to assist her with the arguments. \nOn 6 October, the court also appointed its own interpreter for Ms Sunny, the first in the court's history, so that \"she could understand what was going on\" during the proceedings.\n\"In fact, we are thinking that for the constitution bench hearings we will have an interpreter so that everyone can follow the proceedings,\" Justice Chandrachud said.\nObservers say that Ms Sunny's presence in the top court would help make the Indian legal system more inclusive and accommodative to the needs of the deaf community.\nSenior lawyer Menaka Guruswamy called it a \"truly historic and momentous\" occasion. \nSanchita Ain, the lawyer with whom Ms Sunny works, told the BBC that Ms Sunny's work would have positive, long-term implications. \"She has broken many stereotypes, this will encourage more deaf students to study law and make the legal system accessible to the deaf,\" she said. \nA resident of the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), Ms Sunny has been practising law for two years. \nIn the city's lower courts, she was not allowed to use an interpreter because the judges thought they would not have the required legal knowledge to understand legal terminology, she said. So she would submit her arguments in writing.\nSaurav Roychowdhury, who interpreted for Ms Sarah when she first appeared before the Supreme Court, has not studied law but has experience of translating for lawyers and legal students. He has also appeared in the Delhi High Court in the past for deaf lawyers in two cases. \nBut no Indian sign language interpreter is trained in legal terminology at the moment - and so for anyone translating, it's going to be a work in progress \nMs Sunny told the BBC that she was proud of how far she had come. \"I wanted to show those who are cannot hear that if I can do it, they can also do it.\"\nMs Sunny was born in Bengaluru. Her twin sister Maria Sunny and her brother Pratik Kuruvilla are also deaf. Mr Kuruvilla is a software engineer in the US and now teaches at a school for the deaf in Texas, while Ms Maria is a chartered accountant. \nTheir parents did not want their children to study in special schools for deaf children. Finding a place that was willing to take in the three siblings was hard, but they eventually found the right place for them. \nIn class, Ms Sunny studied by lip reading and with the help of her friends. \"There were also others who made fun of me but I always argued with them,\" she said. \nMs Sunny went on to study law at St. Joseph's College in Bengaluru. Her mother, who would help her during school, could not do the same with her law course. But Ms Sunny said she got support from a friend and her siblings. \nIn 2021, she took the bar exam to enrol as an advocate and began practising law. \nShe said she was grateful to her parents for treating all three children equally and \"putting us through education in a normal school because they believe in equality\". \n\"That's what gave me the confidence to follow my dreams.\"\nExperts say that deaf people in the country are often unable to build a career in law because of stigma and the lack of interpreters in courts. \nOn 17 April, the Delhi High Court set a precedent when it allowed deaf lawyer Saudamini Pethe to appear in a case. Like Ms Sunny, she too had to bring an interpreter. \nIn September, the high court said it would start appointing its own interpreters after another deaf lawyer asked for two sign language experts - one for lawyers and the other for the judges. \nThe court also asked the Association of Sign Language Interpreters India (ASLI) to draw up protocols for the interpreters. \nThis was done to make it easy for the lawyers and judges to follow the proceedings, Renuka Rameshan, president of ASLI, told the BBC. \nMs Ain said that experts are also looking to create a legal thesaurus in Indian sign language that would help the deaf lawyers and litigants.\nMr Roychowdhury, the interpreter, said the court's decision could also mean that \"the deaf will realise that they also have an equal right under the law\".\n\"As per the 2011 Census, there were 18m deaf people or people hard of hearing in India. It is good to have the spotlight on sign language to ensure deaf people get their right to accessibility,\" Mr Roychowdhury said.\nHe added that a demand for more interpreters in courts will open up employment opportunities for them. \"There are approximately 400-500 certified interpreters [in the country] but in reality only 40-50 are skilled, qualified and doing ethical work,\" Mr Roychowdhury said. \nRanjini Ramanujam, who is deaf by birth and works at an IT company, called the court's move \"a blessing\" and \"a barrier remover\". A former badminton player, Ms Ramanujam was awarded India's second-highest sporting honour in 1999.\n\"The Supreme Court's move has given a voice to the deaf,\" she said. \"The court has set an example for other offices to follow as well.\"\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

{"title": "Biden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis", "date": "2023-10-08 03:13:19", "text": "The recent surge of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border has put President Joe Biden in a difficult, politically threatening bind. \nState and local Democratic leaders who should be among his closest allies heading into next year's presidential election are harshly criticising his handling of immigration. His probable 2024 Republican opponent, Donald Trump, is sharpening his attacks on an issue that has been a central part of his political message for almost a decade. And public support for Mr Biden on the situation is souring.\nWhile voting is still more than a year away, the growing immigration crisis - whose effects are being felt thousands of miles from the US-Mexico border in part because Republican governors have been sending newly arrived migrants to Democratic-run cities - could be a daunting political drag on Mr Biden's popularity and his re-election hopes.\nThe numbers paint a darkening picture. According to preliminary US Department of Homeland Security figures obtained by BBC partner CBS News, US Border Patrol apprehended approximately 210,000 undocumented migrants entering the US during the month of September. That is the highest mark of the year, and comes close to matching the record peak monthly apprehensions of late 2022. \nIf the Biden administration thought the crisis at the border was easing and the national spotlight was moving to other issues after government policy changes earlier this year, the latest increase should dispel that notion.\nWhat's more, the nature of the immigrant surge suggests there may be no end in sight. Roughly a quarter of the border apprehensions last month were citizens of Venezuela, the South American nation that has been struggling through political and economic hardship under the socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. \nThe Venezuelan exodus has created a hemispheric refugee crisis, with more than seven million fleeing the country - and the consequences are being increasingly felt on US soil.\nMore than 150,000 Venezuelans have headed north toward the US, across the Darian Gap into Central America, in the past two months, according to the government of Panama.\n\"People don't pick up and leave their homes just for the heck of it,\" Janet Napolitano, head of homeland security during the Obama administration, told the BBC. \"They're usually in desperate straits - poverty, joblessness, high crime, violence, lack of civil institutions in their countries of origin.\"\nOn Thursday, the Biden administration announced two new steps to address the dramatic increase - and both have opened the president up to attacks from across the political spectrum. The president issued a series of environmental and planning waivers and released funds to build additional sections of wall along the US-Mexico border. \nHe also revealed that the US would resume direct deportations of Venezuelan citizens - a practice that had been suspended because of tense diplomatic relations between the two nations.\nThese new measures were quickly denounced as too little by immigration hard-liners and too much by left-wing immigration activists. The president's muddled explanations - that he still believes walls don't work and that it was money he was forced by Congress to spend - compounded the situation.\nThe Venezuelan announcement also represents a change in attitude by the administration, after moves last month to allow approximately half a million Venezuelan refugees in the US to apply for work permits and avoid deportation for 18 months. \nIn trying to assuage concerns that he is not doing enough to address the border surge while also keeping his liberal supporters happy, he appears to be satisfying no one - a conundrum that has played itself out repeatedly on border policy throughout the Biden presidency.\nImmigration has become an intensely polarising issue, due in no small part to Mr Trump's \"build the wall\" rhetoric and sometimes draconian policies during his presidency. That has greatly curtailed Mr Biden's political flexibility in dealing with the crises. \nWhere Barack Obama was able to increase deportations and strengthen border security during his presidency without facing damaging blowback from liberal activists, Mr Biden has no such luxury. Every step he takes on immigration is now viewed in the context of the current environment of partisan political trench warfare, with Mr Trump and the Republicans on one side and the Democrats on the other.\nMeanwhile, recent polling suggests that in that partisan fight, the public is turning on the president.\nRespondents in a new Marquette University poll of registered voters were asked to choose who was \"better\" on the issue of immigration and border security, the current president or the man he replaced. Fifty-two percent said they preferred Mr Trump, while only 28% opted for Mr Biden.\nThat is tied with the economy for the largest issue gap between the two candidates and stands in contrast to topics like abortion and climate change, where Mr Biden has solid leads.\nThose results were mirrored in an NBC News poll, which found 45% of Americans thought Republicans were better at dealing with immigration versus only 27% for Democrats. It represents a marked change from the Trump presidency, when pluralities of the US public preferred the Democrats.\nThis video can not be played\nOther presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump?\nThe steady drumbeat of disturbing news from the border, as well as the strain on public services felt by the major US cities where the migrants are settling, is making a noticeable mark on public opinion. \nAnd if the crisis does not ease before the 2024 general election campaign begins in earnest, the president will be taking on his Republican opponent on unfavourable political terrain.\nAccording to Ms Napolitano, solving the immigration crisis will take a concerted effort from the Biden team.\n\"It requires diplomatic outreach,\" she says. \"It requires investment in other countries so that we take away some of the incentive to migrate. And it requires strong border security and effective enforcement of our immigration laws, which need to be amended and reformed.\"\nIn the end, the criticism Mr Biden receives for his actions on immigration this week will be much less important than whether or not the new policies work. If they don't, and if the Biden administrations other steps to staunch the flow of migrants from Venezuela and elsewhere are also unsuccessful, his path to re-election becomes more perilous.\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nBiden approves border wall as Mexico crossings rise\nThe Texas town caught in America's border battle\n'We have no more room,' NYC mayor tells migrants\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "'I feel hopeless': Living in Laos on the brink", "date": "2023-10-08 22:07:26", "text": "Jo is the holder of a newly minted degree in English literature from one of the top universities in Laos. But the 22-year-old, who graduated only weeks ago, says he already feels \"hopeless\". \nConfronted with a barren job market, the Vientiane resident holds no hope of finding work at home, and instead aims to become a cleaner or a fruit picker in Australia. His aspirations are low, but they reflect a hushed disenchantment spreading among his peers; the result of a severe and sustained economic downturn that has ravaged Laos for the past two years. \n\"Every person in this generation doesn't believe in the government. They want to leave Laos, they don't believe anything the government says,\" he tells the BBC. \"Most of my friends have the same thoughts, but we only talk about it privately. If you say bad things about them in public, I don't know what will happen.\"  \nThe economic crisis has been caused by a rash programme of government borrowing used to finance Chinese-backed infrastructure projects which has begun to unravel. The crisis shows little sign of easing, with public debt spiralling to unsustainable levels, resulting in government budget cuts, sky-high inflation and record-breaking currency depreciation, leaving many living on the brink in one of South East Asia's poorest countries. \nFaced with a dire economic situation, and with the April shooting of activist Anousa \"Jack\" Luangsuphom underscoring the brutal lengths authorities in the one-party state will go to silence calls for reform, a generation of young Laotians increasingly see their future abroad. \n\"[Young people] aren't even thinking about change, it's a feeling of how am I going to get out of this country - I'm stuck here, there's no future for me,\" said Emilie Pradichit, a Lao-French international human rights lawyer and the founder of human rights group Manushya Foundation. \n\"If you see your country becoming a colony of China, you see a government that is totally corrupt, and you cannot speak up because if you do you might be killed - would you want to stay?\"\nA sparsely populated, landlocked country of 7.5 million people, Laos is one of the region's poorest and least developed nations. In a bid to transform the largely agrarian society, the past decade has seen the government take on major infrastructure projects, mostly financed by historic ally and neighbour China - itself on a lending spree since 2013 as part of its global infrastructure investment programme, the Belt and Road initiative (BRI).\nLaos has built dozens of foreign-financed dams to transform itself into the \"battery of South East Asia\" as a major exporter of electricity to the region. But oversupply has turned many dams unproductive, and the state electricity company sits in $5bn (£4.1bn) debt. Lacking funds, Laos handed a majority Chinese-owned company a 25-year concession to manage large parts of its power grid in 2021, including control over exports. \nAlso among the debt-laden megaprojects is the Lao-China railway, connecting Vientiane to southern China. It opened in December 2021 at a cost of $5.9bn (£4.85bn), but saddled the Lao government with $1.9bn in debt. Beijing says the railway has created an \"economic corridor\", but the numbers just don't add up for some economists, not least because Chinese state-owned companies hold a 70% stake. \n\"I'm sure people are happy to travel very quickly across Laos, but it's not justified at the cost that was agreed to,\" economist Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, says of the railway.  \nAll of this has added to Laos' ballooning debt, which is now ninth highest globally as a share of its GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. Around half of that is owed to China, and Laos is now having to borrow more from lenders in the country just to stay afloat.\n\"Laos is so heavily indebted to China that their negotiating position is compromised,\" he said. \"It's having to borrow just to service the debt. That's the definition of a debt trap.\" \nThe Lao government could not be reached for comment. But Mr Menon emphasised that Laos has repeatedly rejected other international lenders in favour of Beijing, perhaps because of a belief within the government that China \"will not let another socialist country fail\". He added that Beijing was also cautious about letting another BRI country default on its debt after Sri Lanka. \nThis is the second in a series of stories that examines Chinese investment abroad 10 years after Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative. \nRead the first story about the shadowy Chinese firms that own chunks of Cambodia here.\nThe only thing currently preventing that outcome are repeated Chinese debt deferment agreements - the conditions of which remain highly opaque. This has raised concerns over Beijing's growing sway over Laos. When asked if Laos is at risk of becoming a vassal state, Mr Menon said \"that ship has sailed\".\nHe said that the \"macro-instability\" caused by \"massive debt accumulation\" has also caused the decline of the Lao currency, the kip, which continues to depreciate to record lows against the US dollar. This has led to a decades-high rise in prices, and nowhere is this being felt more acutely than among ordinary Laotians. \n\"'I have never experienced anything like this year,\" says Phonxay, a frail looking woman in her 60s, selling household staples at a food market in Vientiane. She said her customers are buying less because \"prices go up day to day\", adding that August was the most expensive month yet. Her family has had to adapt to survive. \n\"My family needs to eat more cheaply than ever before. We eat half of what we used to eat,\" Phonxay says. \"But I'll fight until the end. If I don't, I'll die.\"  \nBut it's young Lao, their futures mortgaged off for the benefit of infrastructure projects offering them few tangible opportunities, that will bear the brunt of the economic crisis for years to come. \n\"Lao is very good to travel, but not good to live in,\" says Sen, a 19-year-old working as a receptionist in a hotel in Luang Prabang in northern Laos. \nThe city is bustling once again, with its Unesco World Heritage Old Quarter of pristine French colonial-era buildings filled with tourists. But Sen says times remain tough: \"For normal people like me it's very hard. It's just better than living as a homeless person in India, and maybe just better than North Korea. I'm serious, we're just trying to survive.\" \nHe earns just $125 per month at his hotel job, but he doesn't see any point in going to university or applying for government jobs as he'd have to \"pay lots of money\" to corrupt officials to get anywhere as he has no family connections. \n\"At the moment, almost every Lao student like myself doesn't want to go to university,\" he says. \"They study Japanese or Korean and then apply to work in factories or farming in those countries.\" \nIt's this \"sense of discouragement among Lao youth… that needs urgent attention,\" says Catherine Phuong, the deputy resident representative at the UN Development Programme in Laos. She pointed to the \"staggering\" NEET (not in education, employment or training) rate of 38.7% among 18-to-24-year olds - by far the highest in South East Asia.\n\"We're especially concerned in Laos that with the debt situation we are seeing reduced investment in the social sector, including health and education,\" she told the BBC. \"I'm sure you can imagine the impact that will have on this generation, not just in the coming years, but in the next 10 to 20 years.\"\nBut with the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, which has ruled the country since 1975, intolerant of dissenting voices, young people have had to turn to social media to air their grievances. \nIt was in March 2022, as inflation and the cost of living began rising, that Anousa \"Jack\" Luangsuphom created Kub Kluen Duay Keyboard or \"The Power of the Keyboard\", one of a growing number of social commentary Facebook pages critical of authorities. \nThe 25-year-old was drawing tens of thousands of followers when he was attacked at a cafe in Vientiane on April 29. CCTV footage shows a masked man firing a bullet into Jack's face and chest. A police statement days later blamed a business dispute or lover's quarrel. Jack survived the attack, but for his followers, the culprit was obvious.\n\"I feel really bad that the government would shoot him, that they would try to control us like that,\" says Jo, the university student in Vientiane, who follows Jack's Facebook page. \"Jack is the voice of Lao people, he said things that normal people are afraid to say.\"\nBut these calls for reform will only be ignored or suppressed, and few know this better than Shui-Meng Ng - the wife of disappeared Lao civil society advocate Sombath Somphone. \nSombath has not been seen since being detained by police in Vientiane in December 2012, a time when his influence was growing and there was hope of reform. \nSpeaking to the BBC from her craft shop in downtown Vientiane, the last place she saw her husband the day he was abducted, Shui-Meng said voices like Jack's and Sombath's are squashed because they grow \"too big a following\" at times when the \"Lao political elite are facing difficulties\". \n\"Every time something like [Jack's shooting] happens, you see this,\" she said, zipping her lips. \"People go silent.\" \nAdditional reporting by Lamxay Duangchan \nLured to become unwitting 'love' fraudsters\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The hunt for a new way to tackle clothing waste", "date": "2023-10-08 23:04:57", "text": "Earlier this year, a satellite photo of a mountain of discarded clothes in Chile's Atacama Desert went viral.\nClearly visible from space, it once again raised questions about the amount of waste the fashion industry is creating, and what we can do about it.\nWhile natural fibres such as cotton and wool will decompose, most manmade fibres, such as polyester and nylon, are not currently biodegradable. They will instead remain in landfills, or where they have been dumped, for decades or even hundreds of years.\nHowever, a US-based scientific organisation is continuing work to find a natural way of getting waste polyester and nylon to quickly decompose.\n\"One of the approaches that we are looking at is how you break down these complicated materials, and in a way that actually gets rid of the toxic effects of dyes and coating,\" says Beth Rattner, the executive director of the Montana-based Biomimicry Institute. \"Using biological materials, whether that be enzymes or bacteria, to create new materials.\"\nShe adds that the aim is to \"take the existing mountains of clothing waste and turn them into something that's biocompatible\".\nThe Biomimicry Institute's project - dubbed Design for Decomposition - will choose tech partners later this year, and report back in 2024.\nMs Rattner says that the new processes it is exploring  can not only help break down existing fabrics in more planet-friendly ways, but could also in future form the basis of new innovative materials.\n\"Instead of dyes you could use the structure of the fibre itself, the same for water repellency, rather than coating it, or to make wrinkle-free fabrics.\"\nWhile the term \"fast fashion\" was originally coined to refer to the short length of time clothes took from going from design stage to shop, it has come to mean endless consumption of cheap clothes.\nAccording to the UK's Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which campaigns for more recycling, every second there are enough garments thrown away to fill a rubbish truck, with less than 1% recycled into new clothes.\nIt means, says Jules Lennon, leader of its fashion programme, that \"today's fashion system is broken\". \n\"More clothes are being made than ever before, yet we are using them less,\" she adds. \"The fashion industry is responsible for more annual greenhouse gas emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.\n\"It is also a significant contributor to biodiversity loss due to soil degradation and waterway pollution caused by raw material production methods and intensive washing and dyeing processes.\"\nJean Hegedus, head of sustainability at Lycra, the maker of the stretchy man-made spandex fabric of the same brand name, is well aware of the problems.\n\"It's estimated that about eight to 10% of all carbon emissions come from the textile and apparel industry, so we know that we have to change,\" she tells the BBC.\nChange for US-based Lycra means finding a natural replacement for the polyester that makes up the majority of its material. Polyester, like nylon, is derived from petroleum.\n\"We found that that if just one component, which makes up 70% of the total fibre, could be swapped from a petroleum-based fibre to a renewable one, it would reduce the firm's carbon footprint by 44%,\" says Ms Hegedus.\nLycra's journey to find this new raw material began in the US state of Iowa, where a company called Qore was working with farmers to create a new fabric made out of sweetcorn, dubbed Qira.\n\"The core product is really interesting,\" says Ms Hegedus. \"It's made from what we call 'industrial dead corn'. So it's not like sweetcorn that's used for human consumption. It's specifically grown for things like materials, or to go into paper, or for animal feed.\"\nLycra is now building a large wind-powered factory in Iowa to make its material using Qira instead of polyester. This is due to start production next year, and Lycra wants 70% of its fibre content to come from the new corn-based fibre.\nNew Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.\nMs Hegedus says the switch will make its material 10% more expensive to manufacture, a cost that it will share with its clothing firm customers. She adds that most \"are very positive\" about the change.\nLycra says that the use of Qira has no negative impact on the functionality or comfort of its products. However, the first version of the corn-based Lycra will not be recyclable, but the firm says it is \"working on\" that problem.\nThe manufacture of clothing using natural materials not previously associated with textile production is a growing sector.\nTake US firm MycoWorks, which produces leather-like material from mushroom mycelium (the roots of the fungi). Its first large-scale manufacturing facility is due to open in South Carolina at the end of the year, and aims to produce several million square feet of its material, known as Reishi, annually.\nMeanwhile, companies such as UK-based Faber Futures are exploring the use of a soil-dwelling bacteria called streptomyces coelicolor. It has the potential to revolutionise the textile dyeing process, because it produces a rainbow of pigments as part of its normal life cycle, from vibrant blues and reds to subtle yellows.\nIn Finland, a company called Spinnova turns wood pulp into clothing fabric.

It was the most joyful set I've ever been on.\n\"I thought, if I can make a movie that's half, or [a] quarter as fun to watch as it was to make, I think maybe we've got a shot.\"\nThe film was shot in the UK at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire.\nIt was released in July, and Gerwig went into cinemas to see the reaction and ensure audiences had the best viewing - and listening - experience, she revealed.\n\"On the opening weekend I was in New York City. And I went around some different theatres and sort of stood in the back. And then also turned up the volume if I felt it was playing at maybe not the perfect level,\" she said. \"It was the most thrilling thing.\"\nShe told film fans at the London festival that she'd grown up loving watching films in movie theatres.\n\"And I think that part of me always wanted to recreate that feeling from childhood of meeting in a dark room with a bunch of people. So it was so moving to me that that was the thing that people experienced.\"\nShe also thanked the BBC for allowing her to use a short extract from its 1995 TV adaptation of Pride & Prejudice in her film.\n\"I was very honoured they said yes to that,\" she said. \"That was a big deal. They don't always say yes. Thank you to Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, that was very lovely.\"\nAnd although she was careful not to name it, Gerwig also spoke briefly about her next, eagerly awaited project, and the challenges it's presenting.\n\"I'm working on something right now, I'm in the writing process,\" she told the audience. \"And it's hard.

{"title": "Minister raised concerns over closure of SAS war crimes investigation", "date": "2023-10-09 04:45:18", "text": "Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer raised serious concerns in government in 2019 over the decision to close an investigation into UK special forces.\nThe BBC understands that Mr Mercer wrote to then-defence secretary Ben Wallace to warn against the closure.\nThe veterans minister, a former British army officer, was privately concerned that there were credible war crimes allegations against British forces.\nWhen the closure was later announced, Mr Mercer publicly backed the decision.\nThe investigation, known as Operation Northmoor, had set out in 2014 to investigate a total of 675 allegations of wrongdoing by UK armed forces in Afghanistan. \nThey included allegations that the nation's elite special forces regiment, the SAS, had murdered dozens of unarmed men, detainees, and civilians during raids.\nBut Operation Northmoor, which was being conducted by the Royal Military Police, was shut down in 2019 with no charges.\nIn 2022, the government announced a public inquiry into the allegations, after BBC One's Panorama revealed that one SAS squadron had killed 54 people in suspicious circumstances in one six-month tour of Afghanistan.\nThe decision to wind down and then close Operation Northmoor with no charges caused consternation among some members of the government and civil service.\nThe BBC understands that Mr Mercer, who served as an Army officer in Afghanistan and had worked alongside UK special forces there, was concerned SAS units may have broken the law during operations, shooting dead unarmed people and planted weapons beside their bodies to justify the killings.\nThere is no suggestion that Mr Mercer had been a direct witness to or had first-hand knowledge of war crimes.\nThe veterans minister warned colleagues that the government could suffer more reputational damage in the long run if it did not seriously investigate alleged British war crimes and prosecute if necessary.\nAn internal email disclosed as part of a subsequent legal case against the Ministry of Defence suggests that Mr Mercer believed the government should publicly acknowledge that \"things went wrong on such operations in Afghanistan\". \nIn the email, the deputy head of the MoD's legal department, writing in late 2019, recounts dissuading the veterans minister that such a statement should be made, on the basis that it could prejudice a review of Operation Northmoor that was being considered by a High Court judge.\nAs a serving government minister, Mr Mercer publicly backed the decision to close both Operation Northmoor and a similar investigation into operations in Iraq, known as IHAT. The closures of both investigations followed allegations that a lawyer, who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, had paid local intermediaries in Iraq to find claimants.\nMr Mercer told the Sunday Telegraph that the closure of Northmoor was \"another significant moment as we retake ground ceded over the years to those who seek to rewrite history and line their own pockets with no regard at all for the damage they have done to some of our nation's finest people\".\nSpeaking during a debate in Parliament a few months earlier, he told the House of Commons that \"the allegation that our armed forces operated so-called death squads in Afghanistan\" was \"simply not true\".\nSpeaking more broadly about UK operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, in the same parliamentary debate, Mr Mercer said it was a \"matter of deep personal regret that original RMP investigations were flawed and that opportunities to hold those responsible to account may now have been lost\".\n\"For this, I unreservedly apologise to those who suffered treatment at the hands of UK forces that was simply unacceptable,\" he said.\nWhen approached for comment, Mr Mercer told the BBC: \"Given the ongoing Independent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan it would be inappropriate to comment on this matter.\"  \nOperation Northmoor has faced criticism in the years since it was closed over an apparent failure to interview key witnesses or secure vital evidence relating to allegations of extra-judicial killings.\nOfficers from the Royal Military Police, which was responsible for the investigation, told Panorama they were blocked by senior military figures from interviewing special forces officers and accessing forensic evidence.\nThey said Operation Northmoor was closed before military police could complete their investigation. \nAn MoD spokesperson told the BBC that it was not appropriate for them to comment on allegations which may fall into the scope of the public inquiry.\nThe public inquiry will begin hearing evidence on Monday.\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share? \nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network. \nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

Higher education providers and student unions which fail to comply may face sanctions, including fines.\nProf Ahmed will also oversee a new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers, who could seek compensation if they suffer from a breach of a university's free speech obligations.\nThat complaints process will come into force next August, and is currently under consultation.\nIn his speech at Kings College London on Monday, Prof Ahmed is expected to say he will protect people who want to express their views on \"Brexit... on statues, or pronouns, or colonialism, or abortion or animal rights, or Ulez\". \nSome speech, such as that which amounts to harassment or incites violence, is not protected by the law or by freedom of speech.\n\"You can speak or write as a Marxist, a post-colonial theorist, a gender-critical feminist or anything else - if you do it within the law,\" Prof Ahmed is expected to say.\nHe will add that freedom of speech allows people to consider different points of view, which makes it \"fundamental\" to a high-quality higher education: \"For many students, university might be the only time in their lives when they have both the time and the relative freedom to embark on this exploration.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nFree-speech tsar Arif Ahmed set to defend all views\nHundreds protest at gender-critical academic talk\nUniversities face fines over free speech breaches\nEx-home secretary's invite pulled by uni society\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Police Scotland's new chief constable Jo Farrell takes up post", "date": "2023-10-09 10:46:48", "text": "The incoming chief constable of Police Scotland takes up her post on Monday.\nJo Farrell is the first woman to lead the force.\nShe joins from Durham Constabulary, which she has led since 2019. She was previously assistant chief constable at Northumbria Police.\nShe was appointed to her new role by the Scottish Police Authority and approved by Justice Secretary Angela Constance.\nMs Constance previously said Ms Farrell \"has shown she has the skills needed to lead the service\".\nThe appointment means Ms Farrell moves from running one of the smallest police forces in the UK, to the second-largest.\nShe faces a number of challenges in the new role.\nThe force is struggling with a projected £19m budget overspend and has announced plans to sell off buildings and cancel the recruitment of 200 new officers. \nIt is also redeploying staff from the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan, Fife, to back up front-line officers during the busy Christmas and New Year period.\nAnd the conduct of Police Scotland officers is at the centre of the inquiry into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died while in police custody in Kirkcaldy in 2015. \nLast month, the retired senior officer who was in charge of the police response after Mr Bayoh's death apologised to the dead man's family for the way they had been treated by officers.\nIn May, the outgoing chief constable Sir Iain Livingstone said the force was \"institutionally racist and discriminatory\".\nHis verdict came after a review uncovered first-hand accounts of racism, sexism and homophobia by serving officers.\nSir Iain said prejudice and bad behaviour within Police Scotland was \"rightly of great concern\" but he stressed that his admission did not mean individual officers and staff were racist or sexist and he also expressed pride and confidence in their work.\nJo Farrell arrives from one of England's smallest forces to lead the UK's second biggest and will immediately face major challenges. \nPolice Scotland's finances are under real pressure.  A smaller number of officers is dealing with a bigger workload, and detection rates for some crimes are going down. \nThe arrival of 200 new recruits in January has been postponed and the force predicts officer numbers could fall to 16,200, the lowest since the SNP took office in 2007.\nThere's a freeze on recruitment of civilian staff and a projected £19m budget overspend.\nThat's this year's financial headache.  Ms Farrell will have to fight Police Scotland's corner in negotiations with the Scottish government over next year's settlement. \nAs if all that wasn't enough, there's Operation Branchform, the force's ongoing investigation into the SNP's finances.  Whichever way that goes, the new chief will have to navigate tricky political waters.\nIn another ongoing controversy, the force is currently more than two years into an investigation into the SNP's finances.\nOfficers are looking into what happened to more than £600,000 of donations given to the SNP by supporters since 2021.\nThe investigation has seen former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon arrested before being released without charge.\nThe same thing has happened to her husband, the SNP's former chief executive Peter Murrell, and the party's former treasurer, Colin Beattie.\nMs Farrell joined the police aged 22 in 1991.\nShe is no stranger to controversy, having dealt with a number of high-profile and difficult policing decision in her four years in charge of the Durham force.\nShe was in charge during the \"beergate\" investigation into Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was cleared of any wrongdoing following allegations he had breached coronavirus rules.\nAnd she led the force during Dominic Cummings' infamous trip to Barnard Castle, County Durham, during the height of the Covid pandemic. \nPolice building sell-off after £19m budget warning\nPolice Scotland scrap plan to recruit 200 officers\nPolice Scotland appoints first female chief\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Matt Dawson: Rugby World Cup 2023 quarter-final predictions", "date": "2023-10-09 10:43:24", "text": "\nLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Rugby Union\nThe safety net is gone.\nThis coming weekend we have the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals. The losers go home, the winners move within two games of glory.\nThe stakes and the standards have just risen to another level.\nSo, who will prevail?\nWales' progress has come at a price.\nThe loss of number eight Taulupe Faletau against Georgia has been compounded by Gareth Anscombe's injury, which may yet rule him out. They are both key players.\nBut Warren Gatland and his side have a happy habit of stepping up when they need to. They have a fantastic pedigree of raising their level in the latter stages of this competition.\nGatland will be reminding them of the opportunity in front of them. They have a very winnable game for a place in a World Cup semi-final.\nFly-half Sam Costelow is inexperienced. He was making only his third start when he stepped in for Anscombe against Georgia. But I thought he played intelligently and kicked his goals well.\nArgentina looked better against Japan in their final Pool D game, but, up until that point, I thought they had lacked cohesion and rhythm.\nThat game, coming a day later than Wales' game against Georgia, won't have helped them overall. It was a really intense one, with lots of running, open rugby in hot conditions in Nantes.\nI think it will be a really tough ask for them to turn over Wales.\nNew Zealand are a very dangerous beast. They have recovered from their opening-day defeat by France by scoring a total of 36 tries in their wins over Namibia, Uruguay and Italy and showing their free-flowing, intelligent rugby.\nBut in a top-end Test match, against an Ireland side who have not put a foot wrong in the tournament, you need more. You need to be able to back up those moments of genius with relentless physicality and faultless consistency and I just don't think the All Blacks have that gear in them.\nScotland are a very good team. They came into Saturday night's match motivated. They had talked up the possibility of beating Ireland. But, they couldn't lay a glove on them. Ireland's dominance started in the front row with Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong, but their whole forward pack was massive. Captain Peter O'Mahony was a totem for them, as he is game after game. Garry Ringrose in the centres was imperious as well.\nAnd Ireland have a 16th man, with the fans at the Stade de France. They beat South Africa there a fortnight ago, they beat Scotland there on Saturday and they will play New Zealand there at the weekend. Paris has become a home from home with thousands of supporters in the stands and the streets. The team feed off the fans, the fans feed off the team and the connection feels really personal between the two.\nIreland have been too good for too long and have too much momentum for the All Blacks.\nThis is a mighty close call.\nFor large parts of the pool stages, Fiji have played better than England. They closed out victory over Australia well and, on the opening weekend, were potentially a Semi Radradra handling error away from beating Wales. \nThe defeat by Portugal in their final Pool C match was less impressive, although, by then, I think they were already looking ahead to England and the last eight. \nFiji go into that quarter-final buoyed by a landmark victory at Twickenham less than two months ago. That result and England's laboured win over Samoa in their own final pool-stage game showed how Steve Borthwick's side struggles against the ball movement and power typical of the Pacific Islanders' game. \nEngland have to go to their strengths and make inroads through their set-piece before they spin the ball any wider. \nTo do that you need George Ford running the show from fly-half and I don't think Owen Farrell's presence outside him helps. They certainly didn't seem to function well together against Samoa, after some promising performances against Argentina and Japan in Farrell's absence. \nEngland have greater experience of the Rugby World Cup knockout stages with veterans of the Japan 2019 campaign throughout the team, but let's not over-state the difference. \nFiji have Levani Botia who has played in the last three Champions Cup finals. They have Josua Tuisova who has played in an Olympic final. Half of their squad play their rugby with big European clubs and are used to week-in week-out high-quality rugby. The other half now get exposed to some of the best rugby in the southern hemisphere with the Fijian Drua's participation in Super Rugby.\nThey are tactically astute and disciplined in defence, while retaining that attacking edge, even if some of the old inconsistencies remain. \nI think England's forward power will just about see them home, but they have to be so much clearer and more clinical compared to the Samoa game.\nThe hosts against the holders - I think this is the toughest one to call of all the last-eight games.\nOne thing in France's favour is the support of the home nation. We have sometimes wondered if the occasion and expectation might prove too much for them, but head coach Fabien Galthie, team manager Raphael Ibanez and defence coach Shaun Edwards seem to be able to manage them through the pressure.\nIt is a brains trust of coaches who have been on the biggest stages and biggest games and know how to manage the build-up.\nWe saw it on the opening night when they beat New Zealand at the Stade de France and we saw it when they closed out the Grand Slam last year against England on the same stage.\nWe also saw it in Marseille last year when they beat South Africa 30-26 in a superb game. France lost Antoine Dupont that day to a red card and still won.\nDupont is still coming back from a facial fracture sustained against Namibia and may not be quite ready for this game. Any team is going to miss the world's best player, but Maxime Lucu, who has stood in at nine, has been an excellent understudy.\nSouth Africa have the tools to beat France. Their defence comes up so fast and they tackle so hard that they can defend the gain-line and slow down France's supply of ball.\nBut France have threats across their team and the intelligence and composure to find them and depose the defending champions.\nMatt Dawson was speaking with BBC Sport's Mike Henson\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe extraordinary worlds of six tiny animals embarking on the biggest journeys of their lives\nAhead of series two, relive the drama of Time, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham\nCould a hearing unlock the mystery of what actually happened to Linda Razzell?\nNeneh Cherry pays tribute to the trailblazing women of hip-hop, from the Bronx to Britain\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}

{"title": "'Beating Man City great for Arsenal and title race'", "date": "2023-10-09 06:50:26", "text": "\nLast updated on 7 hours ago7 hours ago.From the section Premier League\nTo finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League was great for Arsenal and their manager Mikel Arteta, and it is also good for the title race.\nI still think it will just be City and the Gunners battling it out come the end of the season but for now only three points separate the top four, which gives all of them hope.\nThe big surprise is seeing Tottenham lead the way as we head into the international break, but they are flying under new boss Ange Postecoglou and have picked up some excellent results.\nI'm not sure how long Spurs will spend at the summit but the fact they don't have any European football this season will definitely help their chances of staying in the top four.\nIt means they won't face the same demands on their squad as many of their rivals who are in Europe, in terms of the quality and depth that you need to compete in both.\nWe saw how much the same situation helped Newcastle make it into the Champions League places last season, and now it can benefit Spurs too.\nAt some stage, I think they will miss Harry Kane and the points he earned them with the goals he scored when they were not playing well, but they are certainly not having any problems winning without him at the moment. \nKane's departure to Bayern Munich has given their other attacking players the opportunity to step up and do their part, and their new signings like midfielder James Maddison and defender Micky van de Ven have been superb.\nSo far, Liverpool are right up there as well, but again I am not convinced they will sustain a title challenge.\nJurgen Klopp's side are always going to score goals because of the attacking players that they have, but I still have my doubts about them defensively.\nThe Reds are exciting to watch when they come forward but we saw again in their draw with Brighton that they concede too easily - there is something missing at the back.\nI know Ibrahima Konate will be back from injury soon, which will help, but teams seem to be able to play through them quite easily and they just don't look solid enough.\nThe way I look at it, if you finish above City, you will win the league - and Arsenal are the team who look most capable of doing that this season and ending their dominance.\nSunday's win over the defending champions was a huge result for the Gunners' belief and confidence, but the best sign of where they are at is that they did it without playing particularly well.\nWhat Mikel Arteta's side did do throughout, however, was defend extremely well. \nAfter having a couple of chances in the opening minutes, City did not get another sniff and I've not seen many teams keep them that quiet in recent years.\nArteta's substitutes made a huge difference, too - all of them made an impact, one of them [Kai Havertz] made their winning goal, and another [Gabriel Martinelli] scored it. \nYou could already see Arsenal's squad is stronger now than it was last season, but nothing shows it more than sending someone on to change a big game like that.\nArsenal didn't create much either before they scored but they stuck together and were solid. When you do that, you always give yourself a chance.\nYes, they got a bit of luck with the deflection off Nathan Ake for their goal but Arteta will say they absolutely deserved their win and I don't think anyone could argue with that - City simply did not do enough.\nThis was their third defeat in three games without Rodri, who was completing his suspension for his red card against Nottingham Forest last month, and they definitely seemed more cautious without him.\nWe are used to seeing City push on with the ball home or away, whoever the opposition, but that just didn't seem to happen this time. They didn't play well, and paid the price.\nThis is just a blip for City, and it won't be long until they are back to their best.\nI am not convinced the same applies to their neighbours Manchester United, who fought back brilliantly to beat Brentford on Saturday but continue to struggle for any kind of consistent form.\nThere is still time for Erik ten Hag's side to find their feet but I think there are deeper-rooted problems at the club, which will take time to iron out.\nBefore the season started, I backed United to make the top four again, but they are just not as good as I thought they would be - at least not yet.\nLate comebacks like the one they produced against Brentford can be a turning point in a team's season, but I don't think that will be the case for United.\nI need to see more evidence than that to suggest that they are back, and I haven't seen anywhere near enough from their performances all season to think they can challenge for the top four.\nNewcastle also have got some ground to make up on the leading pack, but overall I am pretty pleased with the start they have made.\nI always thought it would be tough for them to get into the Champions League places again after finishing fourth last time, and they have had to deal with a difficult run of early games.\nThey lost three in a row to City, Liverpool and Brighton, which was a blow, but it was the manner of the home defeat to the Reds that was the most damaging - losing so late, and to 10 men.\nSince then, though, they have recovered well and got some great results in the Premier League despite having key players like Sven Botman, Joelinton and Callum Wilson out injured.\nOn top of that, their performances in their two games in the Champions League have been phenomenal. \nYes, they might have got a bit lucky in Milan but there was nothing fortunate about the way they beat Paris St-Germain last week - it was an amazing game, one of the best I have been to.\nNights like that lift the whole club and they are exactly what they worked so hard for last year.\nFollowing that up against West Ham on Sunday was always going to be tough, and they struggled to find their rhythm in the first half, which was understandable.\nAfter that, though, they showed a great reaction and will feel they should have won it. The only disappointing part of their whole week was seeing West Ham equalise so late on.\nAlan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThe extraordinary worlds of six tiny animals embarking on the biggest journeys of their lives\nAhead of series two, relive the drama of Time, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham\nCould a hearing unlock the mystery of what actually happened to Linda Razzell?\nNeneh Cherry pays tribute to the trailblazing women of hip-hop, from the Bronx to Britain\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

{"title": "Five ways to save money on your packed lunch", "date": "2023-09-18 16:36:41", "text": "Usually it's cheaper to make lunch at home instead of buying food out and about. But over the last year, staple lunchtime ingredients have gone up in price at the supermarket.\nWe've gathered some top tips on how to keep costs down when making a packed lunch for work, school or a day trip.\nCaroline Job launched blog and YouTube channel Lunchbox World when coming up with different ideas for her three kids' packed lunches. She enters an identical list of items into different supermarkets' online shopping apps to see which one comes up cheapest, and looks for discount codes.\nAlthough it might take a bit of extra time, Caroline says it has made a big difference as she has noticed the prices going up for different products like cucumbers or eggs.\nIf you buy your food from town centre convenience stores they might charge more - so you could save money by going to a large supermarket to stock up.\nYou could also consider swapping your favourite branded snacks for own-label versions.\nCaroline also suggests taking a look at what is in the cupboards, fridge or freezer before doing the food shop to make sure you're not doubling up.\n\"Have a plan as to what meals you're going to prep and what you might want to eat that week for your lunch,\" she says.\nShe adds that one \"game changer\" for her was working with best before dates to ensure that food was not being wasted.\n\"I now rejig my menu for the week as it progresses - if the ham is going off, then I'll use that up today and have a chicken sandwich tomorrow.\"\nRitesh, a father of two from Hounslow, adds that prepping different items has helped him manage a squeezed budget.\n\"Our kids love rice pancakes, so we will often prep the mixture the night before and we'll have them for breakfast and combine them with something different for lunch,\" he says.\nIt can be frustrating when a lunchbox comes back from school at the end of the day completely untouched.\nBut the freezer can be a big help when it comes to getting a greater variety of food on the menu for the week.\nThe NHS Better Health website recommends keeping a small selection of different types of bread in the freezer like bagels, pittas and wraps, granary or multigrain. If you pop a piece of greaseproof paper in between each, it's easier to get just one out when it's frozen, Caroline suggests.\nAnd if you're looking for a snack option, frozen fruit is typically cheaper than fresh, especially out of season.\nFrozen fruits count towards your five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. There is less waste and you can choose the exact amount you want to use.\nWith food prices rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, Dr Charlotte Evans - an associate professor at the University of Leeds, specialising in nutritional epidemiology and public health - is concerned the nutritional value of packed lunches might decline as budgets are squeezed.\nShe argues: \"Replacing homemade items with the cheapest, pre-packed snacks like crisps or chocolate biscuits might be the first place people look to make savings.\"\nAlthough it can be tempting to reach for something that saves on time, pre-prepared options can often be a lot more expensive at the shops and less nutritious.\nDr Evans suggests making up your own a Japanese-inspired, compartmentalised bento box to use up leftover items in the fridge or cupboard.\n\"It's a great way to use up lots of little bits - a wrap, some lettuce or carrots, a little bit of bean chilli from the night before.\"\nThe British Nutrition Foundation suggests putting a small handful of mixed dried fruits or nuts into reusable food bags or sealed containers to store in the cupboard to make your own easy snack.\nAnd if you have some spare time, growing your own cress for your egg sandwiches could also be a fun project for the family - as well as cheaper than buying it from the supermarket.\nBatch-cooking is a great way to save on money and time in the long-run, says personal finance expert Rachel Wait.\nShe says that pasta dishes are easy to make in bulk, along with stews with beans, soups or muffins. \nYou could just make a little extra for your evening meal and use the leftovers the day after for your lunchbox.\n\"Cooking with pulses like beans and lentils can be a cheaper alternative to meat and can also help bulk out meals,\" she points out.\nDr Evans adds that adding extra salad items like lettuce or cucumber to a sandwich could help bring costs down too.\n\"It can make a sandwich look much more appetising - different textures, colours... It makes it look like a proper sandwich and bulking up on the veg means you're using perhaps a little bit less of the expensive stuff like cheese and ham.\"\nFive hacks to help save money on your food shop\nPret hikes price of drinks subscription to £30\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Six tips for getting a job if you're over 50", "date": "2023-03-16 11:05:55", "text": "Britain needs you. \nThat was the message from Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday's Budget when he unveiled plans to lure over 50s who have retired early to return to the workforce to help revive the economy.\nSo called \"returnerships\" and skills boot camps were mentioned alongside abolishing the lifetime tax-free limit for pensions savings.\nMr Hunt promised that for anyone looking to get back to work, the government would make it worth their while. \nWe await details of the measures, but in the meantime the BBC asked recruiters and charities for tips for anyone seeking to return to work. \nUnfortunately ageism is still a problem, says James Reed, chief executive of recruitment firm Reed. \n\"Despite legislation to prevent age discrimination, older jobseekers can still face bias,\" he admits. \nHe suggests shifting the focus away from your age and onto your ability wherever you can. \nWhile you shouldn't lie about your age, there's no need to highlight it either,\" he says. \n\"Consider streamlining your CV and taking out older experience that dates back more than 10 years, or omit dates in the section listing your education.\" \nEmployers are allowed to ask for your date of birth, to see whether they are attracting a wide range of candidates, for example. But they should keep this separate from the application, says the charity Age UK. \nIf health is the reason you left your last job, it can be tricky. But you don't have to mention it at interview, unless it could affect your work in the future. \nPetra Tagg, director at Manpower, says it's up to you to decide how much information you share.\n\"There's no need to disclose a history of illness if it won't affect your ability to perform your duties,\" she says.\nHowever, she says be truthful about health concerns that may affect your ability to perform a job or if you may need time off.  \nLaura Reilly, director at Taurus HR, advises keeping the reasons for leaving previous employment relatively light and positive. \n\"Once an offer has been received, any disclosures can be made - including if reasonable adjustments need to be made for you,\" she says. \nYvonne Smyth from recruitment firm Hays says that if you are asked to complete a workplace adjustment assessment or form, that is the time to disclose any health information you feel may have an impact on your work. But that is usually a little further along in the interview process. \nOlder workers can often face prejudicial questions around digital literacy and skills, James Reed says. \nFor that reason he says it's worthwhile polishing skills in areas valued by employers.   \nHe says things like using news alerts to keep up with developments in any given field can help you stand out from the crowd during the interview process.  \nTaking voluntary opportunities can also boost your skills as you effectively get on-the-job training in whatever technology is used, says Stuart Lewis, chief executive of Rest Less, a website that provides resources for jobs and volunteering for the over-50s.\nHe also advises making it clear in your application that you're interested in new challenges and learning new skills. \nSome older people find they don't have the energy for full-time work, or have caring responsibilities or simply prefer to work part-time.  \nBut you shouldn't be afraid to ask for flexible work. In fact, employers may expect it. \nBusinesses are increasingly realising that offering flexible working helps retain older workers, according to Tracy Riddell, of the Centre for Ageing Better. \nThe Acas website has further guidance on flexible working requests here. \nJames Reed says older jobseekers shouldn't rule out gaining new professional qualifications. It can demonstrate to prospective employers your ability to adapt and learn new skills, or even be the start of a whole new career. \nApprenticeships, for instance, are not just for the young. Older workers and career-switchers can do them too. \nAnd think about your \"transferable skills\", says Clare McCartney from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.   \nIf you are a good communicator or have lots of leadership experience, for example, you could consider applying for jobs in different industries, she says. \nThe UK government has further advice on support for older workers here. \nPetra Tagg from Manpower says older workers should try to avoid falling into the trap of undervaluing themselves.   \nShe says that often the advantage for older workers is the breadth of experience they bring. \n\"In circumstances where other, younger candidates may seem to have more to offer, reminding yourself of what makes you stand out from the crowd is a quick and effective way to build awareness and confidence in yourself and your own worth,\" she says.  \nShe says people can use a job description \"to pull out all the things you can do, and give real examples, rather than focusing on those you don't have experience in\".\nI made my business digital so I can work beyond 60\nOver-50s: We are not seen as useful at work\nWho are the millions of Britons not working?\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel", "date": "2023-07-03 13:01:34", "text": "Making fewer journeys is the most obvious way to save money, but how else can you use less fuel?\nHere are five popular tips from drivers - and whether or not they really work.\nMany motorists consider driving at exactly 56mph to be optimum for fuel efficiency.\nHowever, there is no ideal fixed driving speed, according to the RAC motoring group.\nThe 56mph myth, it says, came out of old fuel consumption tests - comparing driving in a built-up area to driving at 56mph and at 75mph.\nThe most efficient of the three was 56mph, which led people to think this was always the best speed. \nHowever, depending on the type of car and its size, the RAC says 45-50mph is most efficient.\nIf you've ever resisted the urge to reach for the air conditioning on a hot summer's day to save fuel, you were right to do so.\nExtra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10% according to the AA.\nThe impact might be more noticeable on shorter trips - that's because the air conditioner has to use more power initially to bring down the inside temperature of your car.\nOpening your windows might be better, but this creates a separate problem called \"drag\". This is where your engine has to work harder to compensate for the air resistance created by the open windows.\nIf you're forced to choose between two, the best option will depend on your speed. The air conditioner is probably the better above 50mph because the faster you drive the greater the drag caused by open windows. \nCoasting is when you drive with the car in neutral, or with the clutch pedal held down.\nThe AA recommends against coasting. Not only could it be unsafe (because you can't accelerate out of a tricky situation), the group also says it's unlikely to save you any petrol. \nIt says most cars have electric controls which cut the supply of fuel each time you take your foot off the accelerator - so there's nothing to be gained by coasting.\nCruise control - a device which keeps your car at a constant speed without having to use the accelerator pedal - is often seen as a sure-fire way to save fuel, as it avoids unnecessary acceleration and harsh braking. \nHowever, this may only be true when it comes to motorway driving - due to the constant flat surface. \nOn other road types you are more likely to come across hills and your cruise control will take time to adjust to the change in gradient, using up more fuel in the process.\nNormally you take your foot off the accelerator as you begin to descend down a hill, but as your cruise control can't see what's in front it spends extra time using power - leading to worse fuel consumption.\nUnderinflated tyres will use up extra petrol. The advice is to check your pressures regularly, especially before heading off on a long journey. \nThe correct pressure will be listed in your car's manual, but you may need to increase it to the recommended maximum if you're carrying several passengers and heavy luggage.\nHowever, any extra weight will still use up additional fuel - so leave out anything you don't need.\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.\nPersonal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.\nSome ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. \nSplit ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.\nSome websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.\nSplit My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. \nAlso, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.  \nRail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.\nThere are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. \nFor example, the regional Cotswold Line Railcard costs £9.95, is valid for one year and gives you a 34% discount on off-peak single and return tickets.\nMore information on the different types of railcard are here.\nYou can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults. \nThe group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. \nGroups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.\nNational flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. \nThe flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. \nTrain companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.  \nThe Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.\nFor those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.
