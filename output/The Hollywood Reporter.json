A new, as yet unnamed entity will be established to manage the talent agency’s current roster of performers. The company said it will ask its fan club members to come up with the name for the new agency.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean Wave Comes Full Circle at the Busan Film Fest\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Chicken Run 2' Director on Reuniting the Flock After 23 Years and Why Mel Gibson Didn't Return\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe move comes after years of cover-ups and denials by Johnny & Associates and amid mounting pressure within Japan and globally for a reckoning.\n\n\tAn external investigative committee set up by the agency says it had received reports of abuse from 478 of Kitagawa’s victims as of Sept. 30, with 325 of them seeking compensation. Some of the victims who have spoken out publicly have alleged that the abuse occurred over one hundred times and began when they were elementary school-aged. \n\n\t“We would like to properly create a framework that stands alongside the victims,” Noriyuki Higashiyama, the current president of Johnny & Associates (locally known as just Johnny’s), said at the Tokyo press conference. \n\n\tBut some members of an advocacy group made up of victims — calling itself the “Johnny’s Sexual Assault Victims Association” (JSAVA) — were sharply critical of the plans unveiled Monday. \n\n\tShinichi Kimura, a former dancer and singer who has alleged he was assaulted at the age of 18 by Kitagawa in the mid-1990s, said it was inappropriate for Johnny’s to simply create a new entity to house its business.\n\n\t“Talent should be transferred to a totally different agency and Johnny’s entertainment activities should be discontinued altogether,” Kimura told the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper. \n\n\tOthers have slammed the company’s rebranding effort. \n\n\t“Naming the company for compensation Smile Up is like asking people to wear white to a funeral. It’s ridiculing the victims,” said a JSAVA member and alleged victim who chose to remain anonymous by using the pseudonym “Izumi.” \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJohnny’s first acknowledged and apologized for the enormous abuses committed by Kitagawa at a press conference on Sept. 7. Julie Keiko Fujishima, Kitagawa’s niece and Johnny’s former president, tearfully resigned and was replaced by Higashiyama, who has been employed by the agency since 1979. The company insisted at the time that it would remain a going concern in the Japanese entertainment world and wouldn’t be changing its name, sparking instant backlash. \n\n\tThe incoming president Higashiyama has also faced allegations that he, too, sexually abused young boys during his long tenure at Johnny’s. When asked about the claims in September, he said, “I don’t remember clearly. Maybe it happened, maybe it didn’t. I have trouble remembering.” \n\n\tPublic pressure on the company escalated significantly in the wake of the September press briefing. Major Japanese advertisers like Asahi Group Holdings and Nissan said they would no longer use Johnny’s performers in their TV commercials, while national broadcaster NHK promised to not employ the agency’s performers until the company had implemented compensation to past victims. \n\n\tAt the press conference on Monday, Higashiyama more directly denied the sexual abuse allegations against him, but added that he may have committed acts of power harassment in his youth. He also acknowledged that the company’s response at the September press conference had been inadequate. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHe said: “That was indeed criticized as being inward-looking. We have since considered what a fresh start would entail.”\n\n\tHigashiyama said the company will begin providing compensation to victims in November. Once all victims have been compensated, Smile Up will be disbanded, he said. \n\n\tWhen Kitagawa died of a stroke in 2019, he was a national institution in Japan, credited with pioneering the J-pop boy band model of entertainment that swept Asia in the 1980s and 1990s, ahead of the K-pop wave that would later conquer the world. A ruthless businessman, he was known for his masterful manipulation of Tokyo’s top media and entertainment conglomerates, leveraging his talent’s star power to command top fees and total obedience over how he and his company were covered. Upon Kitagawa’s death, then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe offered condolences.\n\n\tFor decades, however, talk of Kitagawa using his agency to sexually prey upon the young boys and men in his employ was considered an open secret across the Japanese entertainment world. The earliest known legal claims against Kitagawa date back to 1965, when the parents of four boys attempted to sue him for making sexual advances toward their children. A number of books written by former Johnny’s stars were later published in the late 1980s and 1990s containing accounts of abuse both experienced and witnessed. Then, in 1999, a local tabloid published a 10-part series detailing graphic accounts of rape by Kitagawa from a dozen victims. Kitagawa proceeded to sue the publisher for libel and won damages, but the decision was later overturned, with the Tokyo High Court concluding that the abuse allegations were “largely true.” Nonetheless, Japan’s mainstream media maintained near-total silence — even though the allegations involved the man behind some of the country’s very biggest pop stars, including idol groups like SMAP, Shonentai, Arashi and Travis Japan. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIt wasn’t until the BBC aired an in-depth documentary examining the allegations this March — Predator: The Secret Scandal of J-pop — that victims began to speak out publicly and Japanese media started to cautiously cover the scandal. \n\n\tSeveral weeks after the airing of the BBC’s documentary, Kauan Okamoto, a former member of Johnny’s trainee program for aspiring pop idols, Johnny’s Jr., joined the early public accusers by giving a press conference at the Foreign Correspondent’s Club of Japan detailing further allegations against the deceased media magnate.\n\nOkamoto said he signed with the agency when he was 15 years old in 2012, and that he was subsequently abused by Kitagawa about 15 to 20 times over the next four years. He also said he saw Kitagawa sexually assault three of his fellow teenage trainees.According to local press reports, when asked why the boys put up with the abuse, Okamoto said, “In the first place, the boys who could make their debuts at Johnny’s were Mr. Johnny’s favorites. Everybody understood that a word from Mr. Johnny dictates everything.” He also said that he had heard from other Johnny’s Jr. boys, “If you don’t go to [Kitagawa’s] mansion, you won’t become a star.”\n\n\tIn August, a working group from the U.N. Human Rights Council investigated the situation and issued a report concluding that Kitagawa had abused hundreds of boys and that the agency he founded had not taken responsibility for the crimes. Dozens of other victims have since joined Okamoto in coming forward publicly (Johnny’s Sexual Assault Victims Association has published a partial list of accusers, including the time period and age at which the abuse occurred). \n\n\tAround that same time, a former veteran Johnny’s staffer told local tabloid Shukan Bunshun — the same outlet that Kitagawa sued in the 1990s — that the situation was “more than a case of the president of an idol empire being a sexual predator.” \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“This was a sexual abuser who created an idol empire just so that he could groom boys on their way to making their [showbiz] debut,” he said.   \nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

With a tentative agreement in hand, the guild called an end to the strike last week, which allowed ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live, CBS’ Late Show With Stephen Colbert and NBC’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night With Seth Meyers to start up again. (HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher and Last Week Tonight With John Oliver resumed over the weekend.)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Says He's \"Furious\" at Studios for Prolonging the Writers Strike\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRobin Williams' Daughter Zelda Criticizes Use of AI to Re-create His Voice: \"I Find It Personally Disturbing\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAll four hosts opened their shows with expressions of gratitude for the WGA’s new contract. In a pre-taped cold open, Colbert pretended to be on a rowboat at sea when a dolphin informed him the strike had ended with, among other things, regulations on artificial intelligence in the writing process: “Oh, I see, artificial intelligence can be used, but it can’t be credited as a writer or be a source of literary material? That makes sense — why did that take five months?”\nAfter 148 days on the open sea, our captain returns to shore just in time to host The Late Show. 🐬#Colbert pic.twitter.com/xI2XKDAq1D\n\n\t“It feels good to be back,” Colbert said, noting that “Thanks to the picket lines, my writers got fresh air and sunshine — and they do not care for that. Now they’re back safely in their joke holes, doing what they do best: Making my prompter word screen full of good and ha-ha.”\n\n\tFallon launched into a series of jokes about how excited he was to be back in the Tonight Show studio: “I’m more excited than a guy seeing the Beetlejuice musical with Lauren Boebert. I’m more excited than a Jets fan during the first three plays of the season.” After a break, he got a little more serious, saying “I had a lot of time — five months — to really sit and think. I just took a moment and realized how grateful I am for all of this, for this show. I really love this job.”\n\n\tKimmel — whose show began a little later than Fallon’s or Colbert’s, thanks to Monday Night Football on ABC — did a cold open of him in therapy (his shrink: guest Arnold Schwarzenegger), before taking the stage only to find it commandeered by a pickleball foursome. (Fallon joked the Tonight studio had been idle for so long, “NBC turned it into a Spirit Halloween.”)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“We’ve been gone so long, The Bachelor is now a grandfather,” he said. “The weirdest thing about being off the air is, when I walk in a room, nobody claps.” He also thanked the show’s crew “and all union crews” and noted that the WGA’s new contract “is a big win for the little guy, and a big win for the chubby guy, and the hairy dude, and the weird girl who doesn’t make eye contact, and the two potheads in the Star Wars T-shirts that are too small for their bodies, the guy who’s too old to have a ponytail and the lady whose cats each have their own Instagram pages. We call them writers, and they are all back to work.”\n\n\tMeyers, in a clip released before the show aired, delivered heartfelt thanks to his fellow writers and WGA leadership for getting the deal done and to the Late Night crew “for their patience while we worked through this very necessary labor stoppage.” \n\n\tHe also acknowledged his family, noting that “It was not easy to have me around for 5 months. I’ll never forget the day this summer, my 7-year-old came up to me and said, ‘Not only do I not care what Rudy Giuliani did today, I’m not gonna care what he does tomorrow.’ While I hear that, I do think he’s missing out.”\n\n\tAfter getting their thankful remarks out of the way, the hosts attempted in varying degrees to recap the time they’d been off the air. Colbert launched into several minutes of clips and jokes about the news of the summer, heavy on the multiple indictments of Donald Trump, and Kimmel went hard at the former president as well. Fallon opted for a simpler strategy: “We have so much news to cover, but I’m going to sum it up in two words: Taylor Swift.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMeyers devoted his entire show to his Closer Look segment (“to the max!”), opening it with a breathless summary of what was to come: \nA post shared by Late Night with Seth Meyers (@latenightseth)\n\n\tFallon had Matthew McConaughey and John Mayer as his first-night guests, while Kimmel welcomed Scwharzenegger and musical guest Jason Isbell. The Late Show featured astrophysicist and Neil deGrasse Tyson and a performance by bandleader Louis Cato. While actors union SAG-AFTRA remains on strike, talk shows are covered under a different contract that allows the hosts to do their jobs and union members to appear, provided they don’t promote any work for struck companies. McConaughey, for example, discussed a children’s book, Just Because, he recently released, as well as his 2021 memoir Greenlights. \nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nInside the business of TV with breaking news, expert analysis and showrunner interviews\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Monday marked the first time that the parties had been back at the negotiations table since the actors’ strike began in mid-July. \n\n\n\n\tSome of the industry’s biggest leaders — Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Disney CEO Bob Iger, and NBCUniversal Studio Group chairman and chief content officer Donna Langley — returned to the bargaining table with SAG-AFTRA on Monday, after the same group helped expedite the Writers Guild of America talks in late September. In a change of pace, the CEOs met with the union on the labor group’s home turf, at the SAG-AFTRA national headquarters on Wilshire Blvd., without any federal mediators present.

Wage increases, a revenue-sharing proposal on streaming titles and regulations for A.I. remain top priorities for the union that have yet to be fully addressed. The union has also pushed an array of smaller items that it has not yet settled with studios, like increases to health plan and pension contribution “caps,” the size of relocation expenses and whether performance-capture work can be covered under the union’s TV/theatrical contract.\n\n\tIn a separate message to members on Monday, SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating committee urged performers to “not let up.” The committee continued, “Keep turning out in full force on our picket lines and at solidarity events around the country. Let the AMPTP hear your voices loud and clear. It makes a difference. YOU make a difference.” The union leaders also said that the group would remain out on strike “as long as it takes.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Draws Trademark Lawsuit From Social Media Ad Agency", "date": "2023-10-03 00:11:26", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nX Social Media says it has used the \"X\" mark to advertise services identical to those offered by X Corp. for at least eight years. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tWinston Cho\n\n\n\tX Corp. has been sued for copyright infringement, wrongful termination and employment discrimination since Elon Musk acquired the company known as Twitter less than a year ago. Trademark infringement can now be added to its list of legal troubles, with the filing of a lawsuit from an advertising agency.\n\n\tThat ad agency, X Social Media, on Monday sued X Corp. in Florida federal court, arguing that the rebrand has confused consumers by leading them to believe that the company’s ad services are associated with the Musk-led company. It seeks an order that would block X Corp. from continuing to use its mark and treble damages for “exceptional” infringement.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLinda Yaccarino Defends Elon Musk in Tense Interview About Twitter's Transformation Into X\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLarry David Confronted Elon Musk Over GOP Support After Uvalde Shooting: \"Do You Just Want to Murder Kids?\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe change from Twitter to X Corp. was made in July as part of Musk’s plans to expand the social media service into an “everything app.” But at the time of the announcement, there were nearly 900 trademark registrations covering the letter “X” across various industries. That included one belonging to Meta for social networking services in entertainment and another belonging to Microsoft for gaming. \n\n\tX Corp. has filed to register “X” for use in association with social media, business data analytics, market research and advertising services, among various other areas. X Social Media, however, says it has used the mark in identical and closely-related services for over eight years.\n\n\t“They also encompass services and market channels where X Social Media has labored for years to successfully cultivate brand awareness for its X SocialMedia Mark among consumers,” states the complaint, which describes the business as utilizing social media to connect consumers with legal services.\n\n\tThis allegedly infringing, overlapping use of the “X” mark has led to the perception that X Corp. is the source for services offered by X Social Media, the company claims. As “X” is a social media platform, “consumers naturally conflate” the two companies, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\tX Social Media says it frequently emphasizes the “X” portion of its mark in advertising, blogs and newsletters, which are named “The X Blog” and “X Weekly,” according to the complaint. It says it has invested over $400 million in advertising, over $2 million of which was to build brand awareness.\n\n\tThe company advertises its services under the federally registered trademark “X SocialMedia” for use in association with advertising services. It says it’s exclusively used the mark since at least 2016, entitling it “to a presumption of incontestability.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe lawsuit claims X Corp.’s adoption of “X” exemplifies exceptional willful conduct since it had a “legal duty to conduct due diligence and avoid infringing” on existing marks. X Social Media allegedly sent a cease-and-desist in August but was ignored.\n\n\t“In a short time, X Corp. has wielded its social media clout, marketing resources, and overall national notoriety to dominate consumer perception of its ‘X’ mark,” the complaint states.\n\n\tX Social Media claims trademark infringement, as well as violations of Florida competition and unfair trade practices laws.\n\n\tTo win the case, X Social Media will have to show that consumers are being confused by X Corp.’s use of an identical mark. The court will assess the degree of similarity of the marks and the proximity in the services offered by the two companies, among other factors. \n\n\tThe company formerly known as Facebook was also sued last year when it rebranded to Meta. Virtual reality company MetaX accused the company of purposely stealing its name as part of its pivot to the metaverse.

{"title": "Stevie Nicks Says ‘Daisy Jones & The Six’ Captured the “Snappy Sarcasm” Between Her and Fleetwood Mac Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham", "date": "2023-10-02 23:19:09", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\n\"It was so real,\" the music legend said. \"I would be watching and be like, 'Well, there you go.' That’s exactly why we did it. That’s exactly why Fleetwood Mac stayed together for 50 years.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tAbbey White\n\nAssociate Editor & News Writer\n\nStevie Nicks is elaborating on why Prime Video hit Daisy Jones & The Six had her feeling “like a ghost watching my own story.”\n\n\tIn a new interview with Vulture, the Fleetwood Mac singer discussed how the show’s stars Riley Keough and Sam Claflin captured the essence of her creative relationship with fellow Fleetwood Mac member Lindsey Buckingham. The interview follows Nicks tweeting her response to the show, which was adapted from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel, while watching the series back in August. Reid has previously said that she pulled from several ’70s bands for inspiration, including Fleetwood Mac. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow 'Daisy Jones & The Six' Casting Directors Made the Band, One Member at a Time\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Daisy Jones & the Six' Showrunner on a Possible Real-Life Concert With the Cast: \"Everyone Involved Really Wants It\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhile discussing the eerie similarities between her own life and what she was seeing onscreen, Nicks pointed to one specific element of Keough and Claflin’s dynamic as the biggest reason why she saw herself in their relationship. \n\n\t“It was a very simple thing. It was the kind of snappy sarcasm between Daisy and Billy, who in my mind was like me and Lindsey,” she explained. “It was the back-and-forth between the two of them. It was so good. It was so real, and it was really so right on.”\n\n\tNicks added that it wasn’t the looks that either actor brought forth for their characters that made her see herself and Buckingham in the show. Instead, it was the electric and magnetic energy Keough and Claflin brought forth, particularly in those charged moments between their characters Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne. \n\n\t“When two people capture the essence of something that reminds you of your life, it’s not like you go, ‘They look just like us,’ or ‘They dress just like us.’ It’s something else. It’s a certain feeling that they got when they would look at each other after being in an argument, and then they’d start to sing. It would blow your mind,” she said.\n\n\t“I would be watching and be like, ‘Well, there you go,'” she continued. “That’s exactly why we did it. That’s exactly why Fleetwood Mac stayed together for 50 years. It was all for the music. It was all just to keep the music going, and the show got it.”\n\n\tNicks also shared her favorite lyric from the fictional band’s catalog before lauding Keough and Claflin for their vocal performances, despite both admitting that they’d had little vocal training going into the show. For Nicks, the performances were impressive enough she’d consider signing the duo as a real band. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“My favorite is the one that goes, ‘We could make a good thing bad.’ That was my favorite,” Nicks said, referring to the “Honeycomb” track. “If it was another time, another day, and there had never been a Fleetwood Mac and I had watched that, and I was a record A&R person, I would’ve said, ‘We need to call them now. We need to sign them now.’ I really felt that. Considering that it seems like neither of them sang much before this, they did an amazing job.”\n\n\tAt another point in the interview, the Fleetwood Mac singer expressed that she doesn’t think there’s a return for the chart-topping, genre-smashing band following member following Christine McVie’s death in November 2022 at 79.  \n\n\t“When Christine died, I felt like you can’t replace her. You just can’t. Without her, what is it?” the singer reflected. “We were on our own in that band. We always were. We protected each other. Who am I going to look over to on the right and have them not be there behind that Hammond organ? When she died, I figured we really can’t go any further with this. There’s no reason to.”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
