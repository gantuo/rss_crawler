{"title": "How to Find The Moon Landing Site Location in Starfield", "date": "2023-10-03 10:00:25", "text": "The site of the Moon Landing is one of many places you can find in the expansive open map of Starfield, with the location granting you a special item.\nThe famous spot where Neil Armstrong took a small step for humankind at the original Moon Landing is a location your character can find in Starfield's expansive map. A reward for your exploration makes this spot worth visiting, not just for the moment that made many dreams of becoming astronauts. A simple side mission that gives reverence to the past, it can be tricky to actually find the reason to travel to the moon of humanity's old home.\nBefore jumping to any familiar solar systems, go to the Lodge and pick up a book from the Constellation's Lounge Quarters. The room where this book can be collected is on the left toward the end of the Lodge's first hallway, in a room with pink pillows. You should find the novel sitting nearby on a desk in this space occupied by many of your companions in Starfield.\nThe title of the book you are trying to find is \"Sir Livingstone's Second Journal,\" which can be spawned with a console command player.additem 00026EAF if you are on PC and unable to find the item.\nRelated: How Many Planets Are In Starfield?\nPicking up the book gives you the Apollo Landing Site zone on the world Luna, Earth's only Moon in Stafield that resides next to the now abandoned planet from which the Apollo crew came. Thankfully, you don't need to prepare for any fights here, as there are no Outposts or pirate bases in the Sol System. Keep in mind that you may have to adjust your ship so that your grav drive can reach this system during a jump.\nThe Moon Landing will be next to the Landing Spot, allowing you to see the flag on Luna's surface and the original Apollo 11 shuttle. Feel free to take a picture of this iconic scenery before grabbing the Apollo Snow Globe on top of the shuttle. This small item acts as your reward along with a small amount of experience, giving you something to decorate an Outpost or your ship in Starfield.\nMany vendors found in Starfield can give your character a good amount of Credits for the Apollo Snow Globe, but it may be better to keep such a one-of-a-kind artifact.\nOnce you find the Moon Landing Site's location in Starfield, you can return at any time to take better pictures or simply explore Luna's surface for a few different resources.\n"}
{"title": "Baldur’s Gate 3: All Zethino Love Test Answers", "date": "2023-10-03 09:31:27", "text": "Zethino's love test in Baldur's Gate 3 is a great way to boost favor with the object of your affection, so long as you give the perfect answers.\nZethino's love test is a wonderful moment for anyone attempting romance in Baldur's Gate 3. No matter who you want to end up with, giving the correct answers to Zethino's questions can improve your relationship with your partner-to-be. The love test gauges how well you know your companion and how compatible the two of you may be.\nZethino is a dryad found in Rivington's Circus of the Last Days. She offers a love test for you and one companion of your choice to see how well you know your love. She will ask three questions about your companion based on their hopes, fears, and personalities. You're sure to impress your crush if you get them all right.\nRelated: Every Baldur’s Gate 3 Romance Option, Ranked Worst To Best\nEach love test is structured the same way in Baldur's Gate 3. After picking a companion to take the test with, you will be telepathically teleported to a beautiful grove with a rolling waterfall. A large log crosses the stream made by the waterfall. You stand at one end while your companion and Zethino stand on the other. Zethino will ask her three questions and give her final verdict on your relationship afterward.\nIf you are hoping to romance Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, you should know her well when you arrive at the Circus of the Last Days. Shadowheart finds comfort in good company and an even better vintage. You will earn her respect by being discreet. Sadly, her deepest shame is that she doesn't know who she is or where she belongs.\nNext on the list is Gale, the Human Wizard, who has a few interesting questions. Starting off with a question that is better suited to a high school icebreaker, Gale would be a shiny red apple if he were a food item. He is happiest while on his balcony in Waterdeep. Lastly, his biggest flaw is that he thinks both he and the world would be better off if he were dead.\nAstarion is a popular romance option in Baldur's Gate 3, so many players will want to invite him to play Zethino's little game. Astarion is happiest when he is elbow-deep in gore. He has a deep desire for revenge, as connected to his vampiric lore. Finally, his greatest fear is breaking a nail (at least, the fear that won't make him hate you). They may not be the deepest answers, but Astarion loves them.\nIf you weren't a fan of Astarion's vain and violent answers, Wyll the Warlock may be your better partner in the love test. On Wyll's darkest day, the best thing to cheer him up would be memories of the first night you shared with him, getting to know one another. He most admires his father, Ulder Ravengard. Because of that, Wyll's greatest regret is leaving his father and city behind.\nLae'zel's powerful skills in battle make her an attractive choice for some players. If you want to take the love test with Lae'zel, you will need to know her deepest desire: to find the truth about Orpheus amidst her queen's lies. Her fondest memory is of your night together. Her legacy will be that of a liberator for the Githyanki people.\nIf you want to romance Zarlach in Baldur's Gate 3, you're in for a fun, bloody ride that likely is not safe for work. Just remember that she hates Gortash above all others. Her perfect day involves bashing baddies interspersed with victory sex. Despite the bloodlust riddling her answers, she hopes to be settled down in a quiet village with a nice partner and a few kids in a decade.\nIf you've decided to romance Halsin in Baldur's Gate 3, the love test is a great way to strengthen your bonds. The first question asks where he is most comfortable, but comfort doesn't come naturally to him. He is most proud of protecting his grove from those who threatened it. Lastly, his greatest failure is allowing the Shadow Curse to blight nature for a hundred years.\nThe last romanceable companion in Baldur's Gate 3, Minthara, likely won't be in many player's parties, but if you're into her evil machinations, you can happily invite her to take the test. There are a couple of different ways you can answer this test, and while both are correct, one provides a stronger romantic outcome than the other. When asked about the Underdark, she misses spiced Ulaver wine and thinly sliced rothe steak. She most admires you of all people. Finally, the worst thing done, in her eyes, is letting herself get captured by the cult of the Absolute.\nIf Orin is still alive at this point, she may appear after the test with a cryptic word or two for you and your companion. However, if you've got all the questions right, that won't matter, as you have gotten one step closer to your desired romantic ending of Baldur's Gate 3.\n"}
{"title": "Minecraft D&D DLC: How to Beat The Demogorgon (Boss Fight)", "date": "2023-10-03 09:00:29", "text": "The final boss of the D&D DLC for Minecraft is the Demogorgon, a monstrous twin-headed demon whose fight will challenge everything you've learned.\nThe true final boss fight to beat in the Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) DLC of Minecraft sees your character fight the Demon Prince of Madness, the infamous Demogorgon. This twin-headed chaotic evil must be driven back into the Abyss in the last portion of the story. However, doing this will challenge everything you've learned, testing your mastery over your character's class skills and abilities.\nBefore you take on this powerful enemy at the end of \"The Abyss Looks Back\" story Chapter, complete any side content you haven't done in the DLC already. This will earn you the money needed to buy the best items in this Minecraft content and level up your character's stats to better face off against Demogorgon. The impressive attention to detail on any side quests will also prolong your adventure.\nRelated: \"Impressively Like D&D\" - MInecraft x Dungeons & Dragons Review\nThe best strategy for defeating Demogorgon is to attack until you need to heal, then run away to recover your health before going back toward the boss. Unlike opponents like the early Juggernaut boss fight in Minecraft's D&D DLC, the Demogorgon has attacks that can counter almost every class. The boss' tendril arm attacks hit in an extremely wide range, either around its whole body or in front of it, knocking your character back when they hit.\nWith every physical strike pushing you away, it can be difficult to hit Demogorgon in Minecraft, while its limbs are easily able to attack your character from even far away in the area. As of this time of writing, there have even been instances of characters having to reset the battle because the boss knocks them out of the arena. Stay far away from Demogorgon when you can, and use long-range spells to damage it before it can reach you.\nIf you don't have long-range options, keep in mind that a poisonous miasma close to Demogorgon causes any character near him to take damage over time. One of the demon's heads can also shoot a purple beam that causes the screen to go dark and confuse you. Similar to the Larva Mage boss fight in Minecraft's D&D DLC, a slow effect can also be applied, making your character easier for the boss to attack.\nAs you continue to apply pressure and damage the boss, several allies from the story will begin to weaken Demogorgon with different magic. Stay alive, heal when you need to, and wait for your dragon friend to give you the perfect chance to slay Demogorgon once and for all to end Minecraft's D&D DLC story.\n"}
{"title": "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Heaviest of Hearts Walkthrough (Choices & Rewards)", "date": "2023-10-03 08:31:31", "text": "The Phantom Liberty DLC of Cyberpunk 2077 includes many choices and rewards for missions like the Heaviest of Hearts, where V must infiltrate a club.\nOne of the quests seen in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC is \"Heaviest of Hearts,\" which offers different rewards for choices made as V attempts to infiltrate a nightclub covertly. Offered during a gig you receive as you explore the new area of Dogtown, this mission tests your stealth skills as you negotiate with some heavy hitters in Night City. Those looking to earn some sweet eddies will want to tackle this task carefully.\nYou will be given this task by Mr. Hands as a Gig side quest that appears toward the central parts of Dogtown close to the Pacifica area. This doesn't occur until you unlock different story endings in Cyberpunk 2077's DLC after completing the tenth main story mission, \"Firestarter.\" Once you travel to the gig location, Mr. Hands will call you to begin the mission with a cautionary tale about the son of a recent client.\nRelated: There’s One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP\nThe first part of this quest requires you to travel to the previously mentioned spot in Dogtown to meet with Michael Maldonado, the client Mr. Hands spoke of over the phone. The fixer has apparently spoken highly of V, leading Michael to request your services directly in Cyberpunk 2077. Talking to the man reveals that his son, Eric, has been targeted to be made an example of by the law despite the legitimate business he runs in Night City.\nApparently, an officer from the D.A.'s office named Georgina Zembinsky has been trying to bring down a crime kingpin named Hector Sacristán and forced Michael to testify against Eric. According to Michael, Eric has info that could incriminate Sacristán, which explains why Georgina wanted to put them in a place where he could testify so badly. Michael asks you to talk to Georgina and convince her not to send Eric to jail for this mission in Cyberpunk 2077.\nMichael lets you know that Georgina can be found at the Heavy Hearts club, the same place where he was beaten to testify against his son in Cyberpunk 2077. One of the optional goals here is to avoid raising the alarm while at the club, making this a stealth mission for those who want bonus rewards. To remain as hidden as possible, speak to the bartender and ask them about Georgina.\nThe bartender will say that the D.A. officer is likely in the VIP booth and to meet with a person named Jack in the bathroom for more information. You'll catch Jack in the middle of some sort of deal; go ahead and kindly interrupt him to find Georgina for you in Cyberpunk 2077. For a small price of 550 Eddies, you can get Jack to immediately contact his sources and confirm your target's location in the club.\nJack also happens to be a vendor that you can purchase multiple items from, including several items such as weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 that could help during this mission if you run into any trouble.\nThe moment you reach the VIP section, you will quickly realize that you aren't allowed in to reach Georgina, making it challenging to keep sticking to stealth. You might find Markus, an NPC that gets thrown out of the VIP section in Cyberpunk 2077 right as you're arriving, but you do not need to talk to him. Go up the stairs leading to the VIP space, but remember that you are in a hostile area where enemies could attack if you get caught.\nEnemies have to be looking in your general direction for you to be spotted, making it easy to get to VIP Rooms 1-3. To make it to the higher number areas, though, you need to hack and disable the security cameras on the ceiling to make it to Georgina.\nMake your way to Room 4, where Jack mentioned friends of Georgina were who would know her location. However, if you want to grab a special weapon, head down to Room 6 without getting spotted to retrieve the Crimestopper weapon in Cyberpunk 2077. Found in a suitcase within the room, this powerful gun lets you lock onto an additional enemy and immobilize targets when fired as a tool not found in any black markets in the Phantom Liberty DLC.\nEven if you aren't interested in the Crimestoppers, an Attorney in Room 4 will direct you to Georgina in Room 6 anyway. Continue to disable security systems and use the bars as cover to move stealthily through the VIP lounge until you reach this private space. The room is locked, so you must travel down the stairs at the end of the area to find a fusebox in Cyberpunk 2077 past some guards that can open a secret path.\nSimilar to the end of the \"Push it to the Limit\" quest in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty, the last part of this mission is simply talking, leading to an interesting decision. No matter what you did to open the hidden path from the fusebox, it will lead to VIP Room 6 on the right. Here, you may finally speak to Georgina, who is flanked by a bodyguard named Hank, who makes the situation far tenser.\nDuring this conversation, Georgina will show V the whole confession from Michael, claiming that the father wasn't harmed and simply sold out his son for some quick money in Cyberpunk 2077. She offers you a deal to let her submit the testimony from an anonymous source so that Michael can be safe from Eric's anger. You can either take the deal or force Georgina to delete the footage if you don't entirely trust her story.\nAgreeing to the deal makes both parties happy, but refusing leads to Hank attacking V unless you have enough Body Attributes to intimidate him. Both decisions end the mission, opening up a passage that leads back to the club's first floor. For either choice, you gain 2,000 Eddies from Michael and another 6,000 credit bonus if you remain hidden for completing the \"Heaviest of Hearts\" mission in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Always Keeps Its 16-Bit Heart In The Right Place&quot; - Pixel Ripped 1995 PSVR2 Review", "date": "2023-10-03 08:01:24", "text": "Pixel Ripped 1995 hits the PSVR2, a nostalgic and brief all-ages adventure through classic gaming that leverages 3D interactivity in inventive ways.\nThe Pixel Ripped series has maintained a consistent following while existing mostly under the radar, keeping perfect pace with new upgrades in VR gaming technology while sticking to its core retro throwback principles over a trio of releases. Pixel Ripped 1995 is the second title in the series, which now enjoys a spiffy PSVR2 update delivering smoother gameplay and some new features for Sony’s flagship headset. For millennial and adjacent gamers who grew up in the wood-paneled television age, Pixel Ripped 1995 hits that sweet spot of nostalgic resonance and good-vibes adventure, even though some of its best ideas could use a little more expansion and attention.\nAs with the other games, players primarily take on the role of a young person interacting with Dot, the hero of the video game realm of Far-of-a-Land. Dot presents most recognizably as Samus Aran of Nintendo’s Metroid franchise, sporting shiny armor and a hand cannon, and any scene in Pixel Ripped 1995 from Dot’s perspective features pixelated 2D graphics smoothly modeled and animated in a 3D space. It’s a consistently cool style that hasn’t really been replicated elsewhere, and the detailed environments from this perspective blend 16-bit textures with all the expectant tricks from immersive VR stationary games.\nPart of Pixel Ripped 1995’s approachability stems from its storytelling, which features a charming Saturday morning cartoon plot arc where Dot seeks the help of the greatest video game players in the \"real\" world to succeed against her arch nemesis, a megalomaniacal goblin named Cyblin Lord. To keep the peace, a cubic MacGuffin known as “The Stone” lies under lock and key in a temple, but Cyblin Lord steals it to subdue and hypnotize the residents of Far-of-a-Land.\nThe narrative progresses over the six chapters of the game, which see Dot and her champion player teaming up; the former typically on a screen and the latter with controller in hand. Pixel Ripped 1995 centers on David, an eleven-year-old video game wiz whose mother constantly harangues him about his constant positioning in front of the screen. Both she and David’s father are well-meaning but uninformed parents, and the game is filled with concerned critiques on gaming pursuits which will feel most familiar to those of a certain age.\nWith those tensions in place, most chapters see David attempting to play a game in his favorite series-within-the-game, Pixel Ripped. These feature various riffs on the 16-bit era and a little beyond, including mascot platformers, the Sega Genesis’ Road Rash series, Star Fox, and other teasing references. There’s a turkey hidden in a predictable wall during a Castlevania-like portion, and one of David’s needling frenemies mentions a secret in a game he learned from his uncle who works for the video game company du jour.\nOf course, there are never any overt mentions of real-life gaming corporations, but Pixel Ripped 1995’s developers clearly grew up among the era’s greats, and the more niche references are sure to resound. Beyond these tips of the hat are the more ineffable cultural details, like trying to play a video game while a parent vents on the phone to a relative about her son’s obsession, or the special thrill of playing an unowned console at a video game store’s kiosk.\nIn most cases, Pixel Ripped 1995 uses these scenarios to add a pleasant twist, complicating the otherwise simple games-within-the-game. In the latter case, Dot merges the game worlds in two different kiosks together, so that weapons picked up in a platformer on one kiosk can be transferred to the hero in the other. Players then have to swap the virtual controllers back and forth to make progress in each of the two games, all while David’s nemesis and a few browsing customers yammer on in the background.\nThis attention to atmosphere is one of Pixel Ripped 1995’s greatest strengths. The reality-bending boss battles that finish off each chapter are another, a set of curious encounters which merge David’s “reality” with Dot’s heroics, ramping up the interactivity further. In one, he tosses banana peels to trip up a two-dimensional boss while controlling a motorcycle-riding Dot, all while dad keeps asking about the commotion coming from the back of the car. In another, he guides her through space hazards wielding her spaceship like a paper plane, which is a strong enough gameplay mechanic to make for its own VR title.\nThe game is quite short, with start to credits requiring approximately three hours in total, though hunting for a series of tucked-away golden cartridges in the game might propel completionists to give it another spin. These collectibles unlock skins for Dot, and a few of their locations are satisfying to solve, though playing through certain chapters to track them all down might be a grueling exercise.\nCertain levels risk dragging the experience down, especially the beat ‘em up chapter. Here, David enters a competition at the local arcade, but the Streets of Rage clone he has to play is absolutely the worst game in the lot. The level boss is easy but noxious, presented as a 1v1 fighter rival, but the simplicity of the action here makes the experience feel broken and much less than the sum of its conceptual parts.\nThe rest of the game fares much better, and the Castlevania section in particular is a genuine treat. Even the stand-in for Belmont with his dopey narcissism could be a sly reference to the cartoon counterpart in Captain N The Game Master; that’s how deeply read the love of gaming is in Pixel Ripped 1995. In many ways the superior update of its predecessor, it’s a digestible VR nostalgia-fest which will resonate most with those of us who remember renting games at the nearby shop and running into a silly name left behind on the last player's save file. With this as the current best version of the game – and a thankfully free PSVR2 upgrade for anyone who still has it in their library – Pixel Ripped 1995 always keeps its 16-bit heart in the right place.\nSource: PlayStation/YouTube\nPixel Ripped 1995 is available on most VR headsets, with this newest edition arriving to PlayStation VR2 on October 3. A digital PSVR2 code was provided to Screen Rant for the purpose of this review.\n"}

With only 6 chances to get the right answer, players may need a little help.\nWordle is a simple word-guessing game that tasks players with solving a five-word puzzle using letter position clues. Wordle presents the player with six rows of five empty boxes. Simply enter a random five-letter word and the website highlights certain letters in green if they are correct, yellow if they are correct but in the wrong spot, or grey if they are not in the word at all. With this information, players need to try to figure out the word within the six guesses to be successful.\nThese types of guessing games have been around for a long time. One of the originals was called Mastermind, where players are tasked with guessing a row of colored pegs that utilizes the same hint systems found in Wordle. If players would like to try the game for themselves, it can be found on the Wordle website, which creates a new puzzle every day, keeps track of players' win streaks and guess distribution, and has a popular sharing ability.\nComedian Patton Oswalt scored a Wordle win-in-two, even though he only got a single misplaced letter from his starting word. He shared his win from July 15th on Twitter and called it \"Lucky!\"\nWith a new Wordle added every day, players may need a little help with the more difficult words, and having a strong starting word is important. Players may not have time to work out the puzzle solution every day, or perhaps they just want to keep their streak going but are having too much difficulty with the daily word. Whatever the reason, players can find every daily Wordle answer used so far in 2023 below.\nLooking for last year's answers? They're all here below for archiving needs.\nSimple games, like Wordle, are the perfect small distraction for the day.

{"title": "Comedy Show From Monty Python Stars Thought Lost For 54 Years Is Found & Can Be Watched Right Now", "date": "2023-10-03 03:17:51", "text": "Once-lost comedy show A Complete and Utter History of Britain, which features Monty Python stars Michael Palin and Terry Jones, has been recovered.\nA decades old British comedy show featuring Monty Python’s Michael Palin and Terry Jones is recovered after it was thought to be long lost. Jones and Palin were two of Monty Python’s six founding cast members, which also included Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gillam, and Eric Idle. As a comedy troupe, Monty Python begin their act through the sketch comedy show Monty Python’s Flying Circus before going on to make a number of feature films, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian.\nA 54-year-old pre-Monty Python comedy series called A Complete and Utter History of Britain has been recovered by ITV, according to British Comedy Guide. Featuring Palin and Jones, the six-part spoof documentary aired in January and February 1969. At one point, it was thought that only the first two installments of A Complete and Utter History of Britain had survived past the broadcast, but upon further investigation, ITV realized that the series had simply been \"mis-catalogued.\" Check out the statement from ITV below:\n\"The series had been sitting in the ITV vaults though mis-catalogued for decades, but through the identification programme we were able to make this remarkable find.\n\"We flagged it to our colleagues in streaming, had the film cleaned and restored from the 16mm telerecordings and then finally made available to our viewers for the first time since the original broadcasts.\"\nA Complete and Utter History of Britain was originally shot in seven parts, with the first two later edited down into one for the television broadcast. Content-wise, A Complete and Utter History of Britain was filmed as a spoof documentary of the British Isles. The mockumentary united Palin and Jones, who would go on to help form Monty Python soon after its broadcast. Monty Python’s Flying Circus ended up airing that same year, in October 1969.\nRelated: Every Movie Monty Python Worked Together In (That Isn't Monty Python)\nParodying British history as Palin and Jones did in A Complete and Utter History of Britain would lay the groundwork for later Monty Python work. Several of the troupe's movies poke fun at history, whether it be King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Jesus in Life of Brian. From the sounds of even the title alone, A Complete and Utter History of Britain exists in a similar vein to later Monty Python movies and shows.\nNow, comedy fans can see this pre-Monty Python work through ITVX Premium. The buildup to this moment is significant, as the previous surviving material for A Complete and Utter History of Britain was released on Blu-ray in 2014. Audiences who have gotten a pre-Monty Python tease with those episodes can now see the full show as A Complete and Utter History of Britain is recovered at last.\nSource: British Comedy Guide\n"}
{"title": "90 Day: The Last Resort: The Real Reason Kalani Stayed With Asuelu After His 10-12 Affairs", "date": "2023-10-03 02:20:25", "text": "Kalani Faagata never opened up about Asuelu Pulaa constantly cheating on her until she poured her heart out on 90 Day: The Last Resort. \n90 Day: The Last Resort star Asuelu Pulaa has cheated multiple times on his wife Kalani Faagata, despite which she continued to stay together with him. When Kalani and Asuelu met, he was 23 years old, and she was 29. Kalani lost her virginity to Asuelu. He was the only man she ever loved until he repeatedly betrayed her trust despite the several chances she gave him to rectify his mistakes. Kalani and Asuelu came to the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off to save their marriage. Kalani had already used the hall pass that Asuelu gave her, and she began dating a man named Dallas Nuez.\nNow that Kalani knows Asuelu is beyond the point of forgiveness, she could have chosen to reveal his dark side to 90 Day Fiancé viewers. Kalani and Asuelu had a session with Dr. Janie Lacey. Kalani’s sister Kolini joined the couple as they used therapy to resolve their issues. Kolini was the only person in the world whom Kalani went to for support whenever Asuelu cheated on her, and there had been “numerous” times he cheated. Kolini’s feelings towards Asuelu changed to those of resentment. Fans never came to know why Kolini disliked Asuelu so much, and it was because Asuelu had cheated on Kalani for the length of their relationship.\n“It was like girl after girl after girl,” said Kalani. Kalani may have thought her 90 Day Fiance would change when he came to America. However, within a year, Asuelu started “online cheating.” Asuelu didn’t physically cheat on her. Asuelu was reaching out to different women online. He used to buy their naked pictures. That continued until the time Asuelu went to Samoa and indulged in oral sex with an unknown woman. Perhaps his getting yeast infection on his tongue was the last straw for Kalani.\n“So collectively, he’s cheated like 10-12 times,” revealed Kalani. She said she felt disgusted with herself just hearing herself say that. Kalani had put Asuelu in a position to allow him to hurt her over and over again. Asuelu defended himself by claiming that growing up his parents didn’t teach him that what he did was wrong. Kalani said “almost all of the men in Samoa think it’s okay.” As per Kalani, married men were hitting on her and Kolini when they were in Samoa. Asuelu’s friends who were married were also hitting on her.\nBy the time Kalani found out Asuelu had cheated on her, she was already pregnant and bringing Asuelu to America. She felt like she needed to “suck it up and hide it.” Kalani wanted Asuelu to get along with her dad and with her family members, so she kept it hidden to protect him. Kalani assumed if Asuelu came to America and was around her dad, he would be a “good guy.” But Kalani’s plan of getting Asuelu out of the environment didn’t help him change.\nKalani held onto the belief that Asuelu would change up until his Samoa trip cheating and up until the 90 Day: The Last Resort star moved on to be with another man who cared. Kalani kept warning him that they’d end up divorced while Asuelu kept cheating. Because Kalani never left, Asuelu believed she would never leave him. Asuelu is making it look like he’s admitting to his mistakes, but he may have lost Kalani for good. Their marriage is beyond saving.\n90 Day: The Last Resort airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "How Saw X's Post-Credits Scene Is A Callback To The Original Movie", "date": "2023-10-03 02:10:28", "text": "Saw X production designer Anthony Stabley explains the connection between the new movie's post-credits scene and the franchise’s original film.\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for Saw X!\nSaw X production designer Anthony Stabley explains how he and his team went to great lengths to create a callback to the original movie in the sequel's post-credits sequence. The latest installment of the Saw franchise takes place between the events of the original film and 2005's Saw II. For the first time, Tobin Bell's John Kramer takes center stage in the lead role as he travels to Mexico for a medical procedure to deal with his cancer. When the experimental procedure is revealed as a scam to defraud the sick, John vows to teach the con artists a lesson using his classic Jigsaw methods.\nThe Saw X post-credit scene shows John torturing the con-man who referred him to the scam medical procedure in the first place. In a surprise reveal, he is joined by Costas Mandylor's Mark Hoffman, a long-running villain of the franchise. However, what connects this scene to the original Saw is that it takes place in the iconic bathroom that served as the prime setting for the 2004 horror classic. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, production designer Stabley explained how he and his team had to study the bathroom from the original film, saying:\n\"We looked at the tile, we were very precise in the way we recreated that...My set designers were pulling their hair a little because we wanted it to be so true. It's so iconic, so it was something that we were very excited to recreate\".\nSaw X has received the most positive reviews of any movie in the series thus far and earned the highest domestic opening weekend of any Saw film since 2010, a deeply impressive feat for the tenth film in a franchise. It is a return to form for a series that has been hit-or-miss, with many praising the characterization of John Kramer and the depiction of his relationship with his apprentice Amanda, portrayed by Shawnee Smith. Saw X also sharply deals with John's struggles with the for-profit healthcare system, reminiscent of another high point for the franchise, Saw VI, which had John take on the private insurance industry.\nRegarding whether there could be a Saw 11 next, the appearance of Hoffman in the post-credits scene appears to set up another installment in the franchise. The creative team has been careful not to commit to a follow-up, though Saw X director Kevin Greutert told Entertainment Weekly that they were \"superstitious about discussing\" more potential sequels before finding out how this installment performed at the box office. With the new movie earning some of the best reviews of the franchise and looking at a solid box office run, Jigsaw and his games could very well return for more.\nSource: EW\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Anthony \"A.J.\" Ricci graduated from Rowan University with a degree in Radio-TV-Film.

{"title": "90 Day Fiancé Couple's Engaged (Proposal Was Terrible - Here's Why)", "date": "2023-10-03 01:20:28", "text": "A new 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple get engaged in the new episode, but the low-effort marriage proposal fails to leave a mark on viewers.\nBrandan DeNucci and Mary Demasu-ay from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way had a mediocre engagement that could've been much better. The 23-year-old had a chaotic journey with his Philippine-born girlfriend. The couple had an obsessive relationship that seemed full of red flags. Nonetheless, they stayed together and decided to make their online relationship official. During the show, Brandan flew to meet Mary in her home country even though he had minimum savings.\nHowever, she repaid him with more doubts, called him out for sitting next to a female passenger, and warned him not to look at other females. Many thought Mary and Brandan would eventually split due to their insecurities. Regardless, the pair shocked everyone by sealing the deal. Recently, Mary revealed she was pregnant with Brandan's baby. The couple looked happier than ever to learn the news and seemed deeply in love. While Brandan and Mary will probably have a happy ending, their proposal and engagement on the show weren't as exciting.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nThere are a few reasons why Brandan's much-awaited proposal wasn't impressive. However, the main reason was a lack of preparation. Most people love planning the proposal, ensuring the timing is right, and making it special for their significant other. However, Brandan didn't do any of that. Instead, he proposed to Mary at the back of their shop. He had no speech and didn't even get on one knee. To make matters worse, Brandan didn't know Mary's finger size and gave her an engagement ring that was too big.\nMany 90 Day Fiancé stars have made mistakes in their relationship. However, Brandan probably surpassed them all by getting the ring engraved. The reality TV star got \"I'm Enough\" inscribed on Mary's engagement ring. He did it as a gesture, hinting at the times they fought and thought they weren't enough for each other. Brandan felt it was a good idea because he didn't want himself or Mary to doubt their relationship anymore. \nAnother big reason why Brandan's proposal flopped on-screen was Mary's reaction. Often, people are happy during these special moments. However, Mary was irritated that Brandan wasn't helping her with household chores. The financial struggle and the baby on the way were other things that stopped her from relishing at the moment. If Brandan had picked a better location, time, and moment, he could've impressed Mary during the proposal. However, his lack of concern or immaturity caused this major milestone to seem like just another day. Still, all that matters is that the new 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 couple is happy.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}

Holly, a 44-year-old barber from Utah, was in a long-distance relationship with Wayne, 40, from South Africa. Holly met Wayne on a Jehovah’s Witness dating site a year before they began filming the reality TV show. She always wanted to marry someone with the same religious background. Wayne was also tired of having relationships with women that never lasted. In the first few days of using the site, Holly came into Wayne’s life.\nHolly and Wayne connected instantly. They sometimes spoke to each other for nine hours straight. Wayne and Holly were video calling for six months when she flew to South Africa to meet him. Wayne decided he wanted to marry her. Within three days, he asked her to marry him. Holly was frightened and ran away, only to say yes to him seconds after Wayne chased her. Holly moved to Johannesburg to get married to him within a week.\nHolly revealed she has been married twice before during her 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 introduction. Holly said that during her first marriage, she got married really young. Holly thinks she lived with her ex as husband and wife for “maybe two months.” They got divorced because Holly believed they were not compatible and total opposites. During her wedding, Holly knew in her heart that her ex was not her “person” and what she was doing wasn’t right.\nHolly’s second marriage lasted for 12 hours “at the most.” She had it annulled. Even during her second wedding, Holly didn't feel 100 percent about the marriage. She was so nervous that she decided to drink. Holly got so drunk that her father had to hold her up as he was walking her down the aisle. Holly knew that her third wedding would be different because she knew Wayne was the right person for her. However, nothing was going right as she got ready for the big day. Holly was an hour late to the wedding, and Wayne worried that Holly may have ran away.\nRegardless, Holly got the perfect fairytale wedding thanks to Wayne. Even if things were falling apart, she and Wayne became husband and wife in a ceremony that made Holly happy. Wayne and Holly have avoided sharing any recent photos together on Instagram, but they do follow each other, which is a good sign. The couple seem to be married, even if Holly suggests she’s back in the U.S. with her new updates. Wayne and Holly could be keeping their current relationship status a secret until the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell All. In that case, this seems to be the most successful and probably last marriage for Holly.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Holly Weeks/Instagram\n"}

Brandan, 23, and Mary, also 23, have been quite a controversial couple on the reality TV show. Brandan and Mary’s 24/7 video calls were the talk of the season, with Mary’s jealousy and insecurities infuriating fans. The couple also didn't have jobs, as Brandan was fired from multiple roles because of his commitment to Mary's video calls. Mary couldn’t even continue her college studies because of Brandan being jealous.\nThree months after Brandan moved to the Philippines, Mary revealed she was pregnant. They broke Mary’s grandparents’ rules by doing so, and Brandan’s lackadaisical approach toward life has been making Mary unhappy. Mary complained she was doing all the chores since she found out she was pregnant, while Brandan woke up late and played video games. According to Mary, Brandan changed, but not for the better. Amidst all this, Brandan proposes to Mary while their future remains unknown.\nIn 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, episode 13, Mary revealed that she and Brandan opened a store outside her house two months ago. Mary was selling groceries, snacks, etc., at the store. Mary came up with the idea because her grandmother owned a similar store when Mary was young. The customers were kids coming from the nearby school. Mary and Brandan visited a local variety store, or sari-sari store, as it's called in the Philippines, to buy chips and candies with other items to stock their own store with.\nMary borrowed money from her friends so she could open her shop and buy the products. It was a lot of pressure for Mary and Brandan to make the business profitable. For instance, Mary and Brandan picked up items worth 470 Philippine Pesos ($8.60) and wished to sell them at 500 Philippine Pesos ($9.16) to make a profit of $0.56. Brandan wondered if they could charge more. Mary explained how the customers could always go to a store where they could get the item for cheap and stop buying from Mary’s store entirely. They had borrowed a total of 60,000 Philippine Pesos ($1098) from her friends.\nBrandan and Mary were aiming to earn 1000 Philippine Pesos ($18) per month. Mary hated that Brandan wasn’t helping her out at the store. She wanted Brandan to wake up early and help at the store because customers were walking away when there was no one there. Brandan complained that his having a language barrier was making it difficult for him to cater to customers. Since Brandan was not a citizen of the Philippines, he wasn’t able to work legally in the country. Brandan started dreading their financial situation even more now because they had a baby on the way.\nBrandan may have been looking for jobs, but the couple seems to be relying on their 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way fame to make money. Brandan and Mary have Cameo accounts, and they have been selling bracelets via an online shop and trying to get their international followers to buy local Filipino snacks. There have been rumors that Brandan and Mary have been reportedly fired from the show. So, in that case, their reality TV career may have ended. It will be interesting to see how the couple puts their entrepreneurial minds to use to make their business a success.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}

Is she still living in Johanessburg, or is she in Utah?\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Holly Weeks got married to Wayne Cornish on episode 10, but has she made South Africa her permanent home since? With her hair that could compete with Rapunzel’s, Holly introduced herself in episode 1 of the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. The barber from Utah was moving to South Africa to be with Wayne, a plumber from Johannesburg. Holly got engaged to Wayne just three days after she met him for the first time. Holly was supposed to marry Wayne within a week of arriving in South Africa. \nWayne’s sister, Rose-Mary, and Holly’s mom, Judy, helped the bride get ready and dressed for her big day. Holly said she had high expectations, and being a Jehovah’s Witness, weddings are big occasions that she looks forward to attending. However, Holly dealt with anxiety before her wedding. She even overslept and missed her eyelash appointment. She was on an emotional rollercoaster because she was never feeling 100 percent when she got married the last two times. Holly expected things to be different with Wayne because he was the right person for her.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nHolly expected an off-beat-themed wedding. A white cake with black icing and a decorative bouquet with black flowers were arranged by Wayne, who also looked after the venue planning. He wanted to make everything special for Holly, which he did. Holly wanted a “Cinderella-ish” wedding, but she felt nothing was going right, which didn’t make her feel “mentally ready.” Wayne grew worried at the wedding venue as he waited for Holly, who was over an hour late. He recalled Holly running away when things didn’t go her way.\n“If Holly doesn’t show up to our wedding, I think we’ll be just done,” said Wayne. Despite everything that didn’t go right, Holly appreciated the efforts her “forever person” Wayne put into giving her the fairytale wedding of her dreams. The bride and groom said \"I do\" in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, episode 10. Holly showed up looking like an “angel,” said Wayne.\nHowever, according to In Touch, Holly didn’t permanently stay in South Africa after her wedding. In August 2023, a report confirmed Holly was “currently living in America” via an Instagram Reel from July. Holly had apparently been a victim of cyberbullying. Her address had been leaked and “posted all over the internet.” Holly was getting messages from someone “threatening to hurt” her. Holly could have just been visiting her home for a short while, but something may have happened between her and Wayne for her to come to the U.S.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSources: In Touch, Holly Weeks/Instagram\n"}

Self-proclaimed bad boy Sarper is a 43-year-old from Turkey who Shekinah fell in love with after meeting him on a dating app. Sarper was wearing highlighter on his nose on their first date, which impressed Shekinah, who's an aesthetician and makeup artist. Sarper wasn’t shy when it came to talking about his past, claiming he slept with most of his 2,500 dates.\nHowever, Shekinah was going to be his last. Shekinah moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul on the reality TV spin-off. Sarper’s past made him look like a red flag to Shekinah, but she chose to ignore it. Sarper wanted Shekinah to be of a certain weight and dress in the way he liked. Still, the only thing truly problematic about Sarper for Shekinah is how he refuses to make their relationship Instagram official. Sarper is not afraid of his adventurous past, but is he too attached to it to tell the world that he’s quit it for good?\nSarper has been working as a professional model for a year. Someone offered him to model for a brand, and as someone who loves “exposing” his body, Sarper took up the opportunity. He did exotic dancing for seven years and enjoyed it a lot. Sarper quit his imports and exports job and started his new stint in fitness and bodybuilding. While he was in the profession, Sarper got a chance to be with over 2500 women. Sarper dated “lots and lots of women” in the past, although most of them were one-night stands.\nSarper is “so obsessed” with his body and how he looks. Sarper dressed as a construction worker to give his girlfriend a private dance. Sarper revealed that when he worked as an exotic dancer, he felt powerful there. He used to be the only man surrounded by women who were obsessed with him. “You feel great, you feel like God, you know,” he said to the cameras. But now, the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 star was only going to dance for Shekinah, who found his gesture “interesting.” Shekinah felt like she was “melting a little” upon seeing her boyfriend. After all, it was the first time he danced “one to one.”\nSarper danced in over 600 bachelorette parties. Half the brides he danced for wanted to sleep with him. However, Sarper only slept with them if he was attracted to them. Sarper described what he did as something he did for “fun.” He didn’t look at it like it was a “service” he was offering. He never thought that he would settle down. Shekinah became the only woman he stayed without sex for 79 days. He had never been loyal to anyone for 43 years. However, Shekinah is not the reason why Sarper quit exotic dancing. His parents weren’t happy about his career choice. Sarper respected their opinion and got into the fitness industry.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}

Stine's newest Stuff of Nightmares comic introduces readers to a killer with a stunning connection to one of his Goosebumps villains.\nWarning: Contains Spoilers for Stuff of Nightmares: Red Murder!\nThe newest comic from author R.L. Stine is redefining one of his most overlooked Goosebumps books. R.L. Stine has become one of the most successful children's authors in modern history. His success with the Goosebumps anthology franchise skyrocketed him to fame, and the name is recognizable to this day with countless reprints and an upcoming reboot series on Disney+. However, Stine is known for more than just his work on the kid-friendly horror series.\nStarting in 2022, R.L. Stine has been collaborating with comic-book publisher BOOM! Studios and a variety of artists to produce new tales of terror aimed squarely at adults called Stuff of Nightmares. In the latest entry, R.L. Stine and Adam Gorham present readers with Stuff of Nightmares: Red Murder. The story follows a comic creator down on his luck after he finds himself struggling to create something successful following the popularity of his first work, Red Murder. Suddenly, at a local comic convention, someone taking on the persona of his bloodthirsty antihero begins killing attendees. It's an interesting premise for a horror story, but fans of the Goosebumps franchise may notice some similarities to one of Stine's original Goosebumps stories.\nRelated: A Mall Santa is Out for Blood in R.L. Stine's STUFF OF NIGHTMARES: SLAY RIDE\nReleased in November 1994, Attack of the Mutant follows the adventures of a comic fan named Skipper who adores the supervillain the Masked Mutant. However, he soon realizes that his favorite villain may actually be real when he notices a building that looks like his base. Red Murder seems to have taken the premise of this Goosebumps story and recontextualized it for adults. After all, the Mad Mutant is not as bloodthirsty as Red Murder, but it's no coincidence that this is Stine's second time taking on the concept. In a way, it works better here, since Attack of the Mutant isn't regarded as one of the best Goosebumps stories. By reframing the tale for adults, the comic gives the concept new life — while also improving on it.\nThose improvements include a twist ending. The Goosebumps story ends nonsensivally with Skipper bleeding comic book ink, hinting that he himself is probably a comic book character. Red Murder, however, reveals that the killer was actually the author of the story the whole time, believing himself to be his non-existent brother. While this ending can be seen coming from a mile away, it makes far more sense than the twist from Goosebumps. But this opens up its own can of worms\nThe stigmatization of people with Dissociate Identity Disorder (DID) is all too prevalent, especially in the horror genre. Making a person with DID the villain has become a harshly negative trope. This comic may be an improvement on Mutant, but it comes at the cost of some ableist undertones. Despite these issues, it's interesting to see Stine take what didn't work when he tried this story in the past and recreate it for his now-adult fans. This opens up the doors to revamping some other past ideas, such as Why I'm Afraid of Bees and Go Eat Worms. The future looks bright for R.L. Stine and his latest series, and if he can continue doing to other Goosebumps books what he did here, Stuff of Nightmares could be even more popular than his beloved '90s classic.\nStuff of Nightmares: Red Murder is available now from BOOM! Studios.\n"}

The graphic novel, part of DC's \"Graphic Novels for Kids\" line, retells the story of Oliver Queen's time stranded on an island, as will be familiar to viewers of the CW series, Arrow. Stranded remixes the hero's classic tale, adjusting it for a younger audience.\nGreen Arrow: Stranded – from the creative team of Brendan Deneen and Bell Hosalla – presents a much younger version of the hero, as the thirteen-year-old finds himself having to survive in the wilderness of a desert island.\nOver the course of the book, Oliver develops the skills that will make him one of DC's iconic heroes, and the savior of Star City.\nRelated: \"No Arrows, No Tricks, No Gimmicks\": Green Arrow Finally Beats One of the DC Universe’s Greatest Villains (Again)\nIn Green Arrow: Stranded, Oliver Queen is on a trip with his dad, his dad's business partner, and the business partner's son. He is much younger in this iteration, a fresh-faced teenager, far from coming into his own as a superhero. Oliver has not been very good at the outings his father takes him on. As a result, he is seen as a bit softer and weaker than the son of his dad's business partner, Tyler, who makes fun of him for his seeming lack of skill. However, when their plane crashes on an island, Ollie is the one who must save the group.\nIn past iterations of Green Arrow's origin, Oliver frequently loses his father immediately after shipwrecks, or other similar incidents. He is usually the sole survivor, being forced to save himself before returning to become a hero in Star City. In Green Arrow: Stranded, Oliver has to save his father and their companions by moving past his past hesitations, and applying the knowledge he acquired, but hadn't previously had use for. Green Arrow: Stranded is a youthful and less grim iteration of the hero, allowing his skills and personality to shine in a more positive way than is usually seen with the character\nGreen Arrow has often tackled tough issues, with his older stories having a strong sociopolitical aspect. Green Arrow: Stranded offers a version of the character relatable to young audiences, making this version of Oliver Queen a bright light in DC's offerings since it captures and showcases his abilities and learning period. It may not show Ollie at his height as a hero in Star City, but it does bring positivity to the characte,r given that his recent media versions are grim and full of grief. Green Arrow: Stranded adds a child-friendly, young version of the titular hero that broadens the character's offerings in a big way that DC should continue providing for comic-loving families.\n"}

Now, thanks to the new Transformers movie, the G.I. Joe movie future is secure. \nAfter a decade-long wait, the G.I. Joe franchise finally has a great movie future thanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. G.I. Joe Retaliation came out in 2013 to middling reviews, leaving its strength as a franchise in jeopardy, and another G.I. Joe film wouldn't come out until 2021, when Henry Golding starred as Snake Eyes. Due to a combination of factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, a weak storyline, and divisive creative decisions, Snake Eyes didn't do well, leaving fans wondering if G.I. Joe 3 would ever happen, and the future of the action franchise continued to be in dire straights.\nThanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, it doesn't matter that the previous two G. I. Joe movies bombed. The Transformers franchise has had its fair share of highs and lows, but it's been on an upswing now that the Transformers timeline has a lot of room to explore different characters and storylines. There are plenty of Transformers yet to appear in the films, and now with the inclusion of G.I. Joe characters in the eighth installment in the film series, there's a chance for both franchises to grow together in the ultimate crossover.\nAfter the main storyline there's a surprising twist in the closing moments of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, where Noah Diaz, the main human character helping the Autobots gets a potential offer from the G.I. Joe. The Transformers' crossover with G.I. Joe sets them up to be part of a bigger universe than they would be on their own. Of course, the tantalizing teaser sets up some big questions about G.I. Joe's movie future, such as how the Joes would work with the Autobots, but the concept has a lot of potential, particularly since both franchises are tied to some of the biggest toy lines in history.\n No characters from the G.I. Joe franchise actually appeared in the film, and it's not clear yet if any of the original cast, like Channing Tatum would decide to return. But given that the series are both very similar in tone, and the Joes have integrated massive amounts of advanced technology into their storylines, it makes sense that in this mid-90s timeline, some of the research in the Joe program could be inspired by Autobot tech.\nThe G.I. Joe movies were heading for a third reboot after Snake Eyes underperformed, but the crossover with Transformers' will mean that the franchise won't have to be carried on its own merit. Bolstered by a stronger IP, it can be part of even bigger events, from the Earth-based to the intergalactic. The crossover also takes the pressure off for a third film which, given its budget and the cost of an ensemble piece, could disappoint at the box office again and kill the franchise for good.\nThanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts reinvigorating interest in Michael Bay's films, the Transformers franchise has already had another film in the timeline greenlit. With the strong personalities of the Autobots and Decepticons, combined with the Joes and members of Cobra, there's no end to the storytelling combinations. And now with the G.I. Joes, it's going to be every kid's dream to see their favorite heroes come together with the best visual effects.\n"}
{"title": "Batman Just Rewired Red Hood's Mind So He Can Never Kill Again (Against His Will)", "date": "2023-10-03 00:00:27", "text": "Batman and Red Hood have always disagreed on how to handle criminals, and it seems Batman has finally decided to end the argument - permanently.\nWarning: contains spoilers for Batman #138!Batman has always had issues when it comes to control, but his latest attack on Red Hood takes this to the extreme. Since he returned to life after being murdered by Joker, the former Robin has embraced lethal justice, killing Gotham's biggest threats rather than locking them up in Arkham. Jason Todd and Batman have clashed again and again over his lethal tactics, and now the Dark Knight has had enough.\nThe face-off happens in Batman #138 by Chip Zdarsky, Jorge Jimenez, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles. After having a full-blown fight with the Bat-Family, Batman ends up kidnapping Jason, bringing him back to Bruce's new apartment where Batman puts Jason through a machine that alters his brain. This altered effect is so strong that Jason initially confuses it for Scarecrow's fear toxin. It turns out what Batman has done is simply edit Jason's brain so that anytime Jason experiences increased adrenaline, he is overcome with unbearable fear. Jason honestly can't believe that Batman would go so far as to change his brain, even suggesting that Batman is no longer in control of his actions. The moment is revealed in a preview of Batman #138 from DC Comics.\nBatman and Jason have always disagreed over how to handle criminals. Due to the death of his parents, Batman has been traumatized by the idea of death, he wants to avoid it by all possible means, for everyone. Jason, on the other hand, believes that instilling fear in criminals only goes so far and that sometimes certain evil-doers have to be killed. This philosophical disagreement has kept Batman and Jason at odds for years. Despite Jason trying to give up lethal force a few times, he's always gone right back to it: most recently Red Hood has sworn to kill the Joker, but Batman is done letting Jason choose murder.\nBatman has always been a control freak, but it's generally within reason. What Batman did to Jason completely crosses the line of what Batman typically finds okay, and even recalls a betrayal that he himself found it difficult to forgive. In the infamous storyline Identity Crisis, Batman walked in on the League wiping the memory of Dr. Light. Batman immediately attacked those responsible and had his memory wiped as well - when Batman learned of this, it's what spurred him to create his anti-Justice League protocols. This shows that Batman is clearly not okay with the idea of messing with people's minds, even if they are brutal criminals. However, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh would be.\nBatman developed the Zur-En-Arrh persona to protect him in cases of psychic attack, but the extremist identity - which sees itself as a pure Batman, without humanity to hold it back - has been messing with his thoughts lately. Zur-En-Arrh set the deadly robot Failsafe on Batman, and now seems to be pushing him to end the threat of Red Hood for good. However, whether Batman is being controlled or not, Zur-En-Arrh is still a part of him, and it's unlikely Red Hood will be willing to forgive Bruce anytime soon. This is especially the case because Batman notes he can't remove things from Red Hood's personality - presumably including his new fear response. Red Hood faces a future where it will be impossible for him to operate as a crime-fighter, and where Batman's betrayal could cut him off from the Bat-Family for good.\nBatman #138 is on sale October 3 from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Will Maleficent 3 Ever Happen? Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 23:44:30", "text": "Maleficent: Mistress of Darkness left the door open for a Maleficent 3, but Disney has so far remained silent. Here's everything we know. \nDisney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil perfectly set up a continued story for the reimagined villain - so will there ever be a Maleficent 3? Based on the famous Sleeping Beauty tale, the franchise stars Angelina Jolie as the titular character. The original Maleficent premiered in 2014 and introduced the new idea that the old villain and her relationship with Princess Aurora were misunderstood. Then, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, released in October 2019, explored how the pair's story progressed after King Stefan's death - and the film certainly left the door open for a threequel. \nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil picks up five years after the death of King Stefan, with Aurora (Elle Fanning) now ruling as Queen of the Moors. The young woman plans to marry her beloved Phillip - the Prince of Ulstead (Harris Dickinson) - but she doesn't fully understand how much his mother, Queen Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), despises the Moors, their fairy culture, and especially Maleficent. The sequel explores the conflict and ultimate victory of Maleficent over the power-hungry Queen Ingrith, as well as her acceptance of Aurora and Prince Phillip's marriage. Still, there may be more to the story that a Maleficent 3 could cover.\nRelated: Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Cast & Character Guide\nThough there have been rumors regarding a Maleficent 3, Disney has yet to confirm that any of these are true. Though this may seem like bad news, the House of Mouse has also done nothing to shut down these rumors, so there is still hope for the Fae's continued story. After all, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil didn't perform too terribly at the box office, with a worldwide gross of about $492 million. This was a considerable drop from the first Maleficent movie's $760 million worldwide gross but could have been enough to justify Disney diving in to make the story a well-rounded trilogy.\nRELATED: Does Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Have An After-Credits Scene?\nEven if Disney were to confirm a Maleficent 3 immediately, it would likely be several years before the film ever hit theaters. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil was officially announced by Disney in 2015, and the film wasn't released until 2019. This means the earliest likely release date for Maleficent 3 would be 2026 or 2027. This comes down to the franchise's rather ambitious production scope. The second film came with all the thrills of an epic fantasy, and it's likely that Disney would want to top this—and that takes time to achieve.\nFans can expect Linda Woolverton to write the screenplay once again, but Disney may choose to keep the template for the first film and have Woolverton write it herself. The sequel’s script was co-written by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, and it's worth noting that Jez Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari) was hired at one point for a rewrite. In general, critics and moviegoers seem to appreciate the franchise’s visual aesthetic, but the script turned out to be a point of concern for Maleficent: Mistress of Evil's critics.\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil ends with a showdown between the Dark Fae and Ulstead forces. Maleficent nearly kills Queen Ingrith but ultimately spares her life after listening to Aurora's pleas for mercy. Unsurprisingly, Queen Ingrith takes advantage of the moment and fires an arrow at Maleficent, but the plan backfires as the Dark Fae leader transforms into the mythical Phoenix. Queen Ingrith panics and pushes Aurora off a castle ledge, yet Maleficent/Phoenix saves the day once again and promptly turns the Queen into a little goat.\nAs for how Mistress of Evil sets up Maleficent 3, the second installment provides a sense of finality for Queen Ingrith. Still, it's possible that the character could return, if only because of Pfeiffer's on-screen charisma and franchise appeal as a baddie. For the third movie, Disney will likely focus on the marriage between Aurora and Phillip and conjure up a new villain that can command the screen like Jolie. Based on critic reviews, moviegoers are hoping that Maleficent 3 will be more focused on story rather than spectacle.\nMaleficent 3 couldn't possibly happen without Jolie and Fanning—the duos' performances make up the backbone of the Disney movie series. A recast for Diaval, Maleficent's loyal servant, would also be quite a disappointment since the character provides a lot of heart to the first two films. Prince Phillip was already recast in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, with Harris Dickinson taking over for Brenton Thwaites, so it would be frustrating to see yet another actor take on this role. Therefore, these four actors would likely need to get on board for Maleficent 3 to become a reality.\nRELATED: Angelina Jolie Reveals Why She’s Barely In Movies Anymore\nAs for the additional characters of Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the majority were left with ambiguous endings that could lead to a role in a threequel. Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith was only turned into a goat in the previous film, and though this was an implied ending for her character, she could always get turned back into a human. Ed Skrein's dark fae character, Borra, could also make a return. Ultimately, assuming the cast is willing to return, there's seemingly nothing stopping the characters of the Maleficent movies from coming together to bring audiences Maleficent 3.\nQ.V.

{"title": "Will The Last Witch Hunter 2 Ever Happen? Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 23:44:05", "text": "The original movie was a fun but forgettable fantasy adventure. Will Vin Diesel return for The Last Witch Hunter 2? Here's what we know.\nWith all the uncertainty around a sequel to The Last Witch Hunter, it's understandable why so many have wondered whether there will be a sequel. The original was a fun but forgettable fantasy adventure that suffered from poor critic reviews, which brings into question the potential for Vin Diesel to return for more in The Last Witch Hunter 2. Given Vin Diesel's long-running success with the Fast & Furious franchise, it's hard to imagine a time when he was reluctant to make sequels. He passed on both 2 Fast 2 Furious and xXx 2 to work on other projects although it was his return in 2009's Fast & Furious that boosted his career to a new level.\nDiesel has starred in every Fast & Furious entry since with his most recent Fast X released in May 2023. Diesel also came back for Riddick and 2017's xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage as part of his career trend as a major blockbuster franchise leading man. The Last Witch Hunter had intended to be another potential movie series for the action star in which he plays an immortal hunter tracking down witches in modern-day New York but there has yet to be an official confirmation of any sequel. The Last Witch Hunter suffered a lukewarm box-office release which already put the sequel in doubt. Vin Diesel has shown to be persistent about projects he loves, however, so The Last Witch Hunter 2 could still happen.\nRELATED: How Much Vin Diesel Was Paid For His 8 Fast & Furious Movies\nThere has been very little concrete news about The Last Witch Hunter 2 despite Vin Diesel's verbal confirmation of it. It is still listed as being in the development stage on IMDb, which historically is very up-to-date about project statuses. The last public comment that Diesel made about The Last Witch Hunter 2 was to Collider more than 3 years ago, stating with conviction that The Last Witch Hunter 2 was in the works. “Lionsgate is coming and saying, ‘We’re putting a writer on for the next one.’ That’s kinda cool! … And this is just recent, by the way. But it’s funny that you mentioned Last Witch Hunter because I’m in a meeting with Lionsgate and they’re actively creating the sequel to The Last Witch Hunter.”\nGiven the unprecedented setbacks with the pandemic and the recently-ended Writers Guild Strike, The Last Witch Hunter 2 might have actually already been released by now in a world where neither of those things happened. According to the information in Diesel's statement, The Last Witch Hunter sequel likely would have been released sometime in 2022 or later if Lionsgate had greenlit the project back in March 2020 and Hollywood hadn't shut down immediately after. As far as cutting-edge news on the matter, there is nothing that adds confirmation to Diesel's original claims over three years ago.\nPrior to the release of the original, Vin Diesel informed fans the studio was so excited by the movie they wanted to start prepping The Last Witch Hunter 2 right away. The actor labeled the would-be series the \"Axe and Cross\" franchise and the studio wanted him to block out time in his schedule for a follow-up. Diesel's Kaulder character is actually based on the actor's own Dungeons & Dragons character but has no relation to the recently successful Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. Rose Leslie, Elijah Wood, and Michael Caine co-starred in the fantasy blockbuster but have not commented on any plans for The Last Witch Hunter 2.\nInitial talks of a Last Witch Hunter franchise immediately went cold following The Last Witch Hunter's release. The film has an abysmal 18% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 34, which are both poor indications of its franchise potential. With the movie grossing less than $150 million worldwide on a reported $90 million budget, it's possible that Hollywood is much more inclined to keep paying Diesel to appear in more Fast & Furious movies than to try and revitalize the Witch Hunter series. Factoring in marketing costs, it's unlikely the original movie turned much of a profit during its 2015 theatrical run. The fantasy project did particularly poorly in the U.S. too, taking in less than $30 million.\nThe Last Witch Hunter 2 could continue to follow the saga of Kaulder while also expanding the fictional universe with the implementation of additional characters and backstory. The biggest question that would need to be answered from the original movie is whether Kaulder would finally become successful in killing the White Queen. If this were to happen, he would finally get revenge for the curse that the Witch Queen placed on Kaulder in which he was forced to experience the infinite loss of his wife and daughter.\nIn turn, Kaulder would also be giving up his immortality, since the first Last Witch Hunter movie identified that Kaulder would die if the Queen's heart stopped beating. The Last Witch Hunter 2 would have to sort out whether or not Kaulder's life could be separated from the fate of the Witch's Queen's heart, which was last heard as a part of Kaulder's weapon stash in his apartment at the end of the original movie.\nThe weak financial return of the original movie would seem to rule out The Last Witch Hunter 2 but Diesel isn't one to let go of a series he's fond of. The character of Riddick in Pitch Black helped make him a star even after the disappointing box office performance of 2004's The Chronicles Of Riddick in which the franchise appeared to be dead. Diesel refused to give up on it and helped finance a lower-budget follow-up simply labeled Riddick, which proved to be a hit back in 2013. In fact, Diesel was so sure of Riddick's potential that he appeared in a cameo in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift for no payment other than to receive the creative rights to the Riddick franchise.\nDielel pulled off a similar feat with xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage following the box-office flop of 2005's xXx: State of The Union. While xXx 4 and Riddick 4 are currently stuck in development stages, they are still reportedly being planned. The Last Witch Hunter may not have set the box office on fire but Diesel could find a way to keep the \"Axe and Cross\" series going. He could also explore options of the next franchise installment being a lower-budget sequel, video game, or some other form of entertainment through another medium. The Last Witch Hunter 2 doesn't appear to be officially in the works but given Diesel's track record with major movie franchises, a follow-up is always on the table.\nSource: Collider\n"}

The adversary in question is named the Adana, an ancient evil whom Blade was tricked into inadvertently bringing into prominence. A warrior he mistook for a foe was actually the key to stopping the Adana, and now that Blade has defeated the warrior, all hope seems lost. Blade has made it his mission to defeat the Adana, alongside a new sidekick of Blade's named Rotha.\nAs they try to find the weapon capable of defeating her, the Adana makes her presence known in Blade #3 by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, Valentina Pinti, KJ Diaz, and VC's Cory Petit. The Adana is confronted by allies of Doctor Strange, hinting at a reunion with his friend Blade.\nThese would-be captors don't put up much of a fight, as the Adana sets their eyes ablaze with fire after urging them to \"see what I will make of this world.\"\nIf readers are to take her words literally, the Adana just inflicted pain by showing her victims a glimpse of a dark future. Anyone familiar with Ghost Rider will recognize that this sounds like a dark twist on his signature move, the Penance Stare. The Stare itself revolves around Ghost Rider staring deeply into the eyes of his latest victim, during which time he forces them to see the sins of their past until these sins become so overwhelming that they burn a hole through the victim from the inside out. While the Ghost Rider's move focuses on the victim's past, the Adana zeroes in on their future.\nConsidering that this would mark the second indirect reference to Ghost Rider during Bryan Hill's Blade run, the similarities between these moves can't be a coincidence. The first reference comes in Hill's Blade: First Bite Infinity Comic series, found exclusively on Marvel Unlimited. The series is a prequel of sorts to Hill's Blade series, acting as a direct prelude to Blade #1. The series does a lot to foreshadow the challenges Blade either will face or continues to face in Hill's series, but the second issue takes space to force Blade to consider his complicated role with teams, namely his past with the Midnight Sons team that included him and Ghost Rider.\nBlade likens the Midnight Sons to a family, but is certain he works better alone. The conclusion of Blade #3 suggests he'll have to get over that obstacle in the next issue's team-up with Doctor Strange, but all signs seem to suggest that the Devil's Bounty Hunter won't be far behind. Given the similarities of their moves, the Ghost Rider's Penance Stare may turn out to be the best way to combat the Adana. At the same time, the Daywalker is currently in search of the Lightbringer, the sword of Lucifer, as the weapon he needs to kill Adana. Blade may need a ride to Hell from an old friend in Ghost Rider to retrieve it.\nBlade #3 is on salw now from Marvel Comics.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

For some time, a favored spot of the family's has been used in the series when they aren't able to film at one of their homes.\nOne of the most recognizable locations from Sister Wives season 18 is Salsa Brava, a local Mexican restaurant in Flagstaff, Arizona where the Brown family lives. Though they have homes in Flagstaff they could film at, it is often easier for them to meet at a neutral location for some of the mor difficult conversations they need to have. Salsa Brava is kind enough to allow Sister Wives to film, typically allowing them the privacy of the entire restaurant in order to keep things quiet surrounding the plot lines of the series.\nOne of the major moments of the early episodes of Sister Wives season 18 was Christine and Kody's first meeting after she left the family and moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. Kody and Christine decided to meet for a meal rather than her heading over to Kody and Robyn's, as it was far more neutral for them as co-parents. Their conversation was difficult, and they were able to have it more comfortably as they spoke in a private room at Salsa Brava. Though their conversation was civil, it was good to know the pair would've been on equal ground if things had gotten uncomfortable.\nAlthough Salsa Brava is likely one of the few restaurants in the Flagstaff area that felt comfortable shutting down big portions of their premises for the family to film, it also happens to be one of their favorite places to eat. According to Kody, the family has shared many big meals together at the restaurant, long before Sister Wives was a part of their life. Though they typically meet up at the restaurant to hash out tough moments, the Sister Wives cast also enjoy the atmosphere for gatherings.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\n"}
{"title": "8 Star Trek Characters Who Died In A Series Premiere", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Star Trek series premieres introduce new characters, starships, and the premise of the show, but sometimes they also leave a body count behind.\nStar Trek series premieres introduce new characters, starships, and the premise of the show, but sometimes they also kill off characters and leave a body count behind. Star Trek: The Original Series was heady science fiction for its mid-1960s era, but it was also an action-adventure series to suit the audience and network demands. Shootouts, fist fights, and character deaths were regular occurrences during the original five-year mission of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the Starship Enterprise.\nStar Trek has spanned 11 live-action and animated series since 1966, with a 12th series, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, already announced, on top of 13 live-action theatrical feature films and a made-for-streaming movie, Star Trek: Section 31, on the way. By and large, Star Trek shows feature an ensemble cast of characters who quickly grow beloved by fans, and most series are set aboard a starship except for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Star Trek series premieres tend to be grand affairs, many two-hour feature film length, that reinforce the franchise's themes of exploration, discovery, and co-existence. But sometimes, Star Trek series premieres are steeped in violence and war, and people die. Here are some notable casualties of Star Trek's series premieres.\nRelated: Star Trek: The Original Series Cast & Character Guide\nLt. Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) was the helmsman of the USS Enterprise and an old friend of Captain James T. Kirk. When the Enterprise entered the Galactic Barrier, Mitchell was struck by strange energies that activated his latent ESP abilities. Mitchell was quickly changed, developing psionic powers like telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. To stop this malevolent danger to the ship, Kirk attempted to maroon Mitchell on Delta Vega. In response, Mitchell rebelled, killing crewmember Lt. Lee Kelso (Paul Carr). Kirk fought and finally killed Mitchell by burying him under tons of rock.\nDr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman) was a psychiatrist serving aboard the USS Enterprise and, like Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell in Star Trek: The Original Series \"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\" Dehner was also changed by the strange energies of the Galactic Barrier. Dehner developed similar psychic powers as Mitchell, which became clear after Captain Kirk tried to maroon Gary on Delta Vega. Dehner sacrificed her life so that Kirk could kill Mitchell. In his log, Captain Kirk noted that both Mitchell and Dr. Dehner had died in the line of duty.\nAlthough \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was the second pilot of Star Trek: The Original Series, it aired later on NBC due to the time needed to complete its visual effects. \"The Man Trap\" was the first episode of Star Trek to actually air on NBC and many fans still consider it Star Trek's series premiere. In \"The Man Trap,\" a salt vampire took the form of a woman named Nancy Crater (Jeanne Bal) and killed people by draining the salt in their bodies. Among the salt vampire's victims were Enterprise crewmen Darnell (Michael Zaslow), Green (Bruce Watson), and Sturgeon (John Arndt), as well as Nancy's husband, Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder). The salt vampire is finally killed by Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley).\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine begins with a flashback to Star Trek: The Next Generation's Battle of Wolf 359, and the death of Jennifer Sisko (Felicia M. Bell), the wife of Lt. Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). Jennifer and Ben were stationed on the USS Saratoga with their young son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), but Ben could only save their son from the Borg attack. Sisko still mourned Jennifer 3 years later when he was made station Commander of Deep Space Nine, and her death defined both Ben and Jake in the early seasons of DS9, although both accepted her loss and moved on with their lives.\nRelated: Every Star Trek Premiere Episode Ranked Worst To Best\nThe series premiere of Star Trek: Enterprise (originally titled just Enterprise) introduced the 22nd century crew of the first Starship Enterprise, the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula). But Enterprise was kicked off by the deaths of aliens landing on Earth. Two Suliban agents pursued a Klingon courier named Klaang (Tiny Lister, Jr.), who crashed in Broken Bow, Oklahoma. Klaang killed his pursuers by blowing up a corn silo, but the Klingon is then seriously injured by a farmer. Returning Klaang to the Klingon homeworld then becomes the first mission of Captain Archer's NX-01 Enterprise.\nStar Trek: Discovery's two-part series premiere, \"The Vulcan Hello\" and \"Battle at the Binary Stars\" erupted into a tragic and bloody affair as the resurgent Klingons declared war of the United Federation of Planets. Fleet Admiral Brett Anderson (Terry Serpico) led the USS Europa to the Binary Star system to answer Commander Michael Burnham's (Sonequa Martin-Green) belief that the Klingons were mounting an attack. Burnham was proven right when a Klingon Cleave Ship rammed into the Europa, destroying the starship and everyone aboard, including Admiral Anderson.\nThe most tragic character death of Star Trek: Discovery's series premiere was Michael Burnham's commanding officer, Captain Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) of the USS Shenzhou. Georgiou was Burnham's mentor whom Michael mutinied against in her desperate attempt to prove the Klingons were about to start a war. Georgiou and Burnham mounted their own offense on the Klingon Sarcophagus Ship where Phillpa was murdered by the Klingon leader, T'Kuvma (Chris Obi). Captain Georgiou's body was left behind on the Klingon ship as Burnham escaped, and the USS Shenzhou was destroyed by the Klingons. Although Captain Georgiou was mourned, her Mirror Universe counterpart, Emperor Philippa Georgiou, became a main character in Star Trek: Discovery's first 3 seasons.\nStar Trek: Picard's series premiere, \"Remembrance,\" ended with the violent murder of Dahj Asha (Isa Briones) by Romulan Zhat Vash operatives. Ostensibly a young woman who sought help from the retired Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), Star Trek: Picard soon revealed that Dahj was synthetic, one of a pair of human-like twin androids built from a positronic neuron recovered from the late Commander Data (Brent Spiner). After Dahj was disintegrated by the Romulans, Picard's mission became about saving Dahj's identical twin, Dr. Soji Asha, from the same fate, and Jean-Luc eventually discovered a race of synthetics spawned from Data's tech living on the planet Coppelius. Tragically, Dahj was the sacrifice that launched Jean-Luc Picard back to saving the galaxy at the dawn of Star Trek's 25th century.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "What’s Going On With Amber Heard In Aquaman 2?", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Amber Heard is only minimally featured in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom's first trailer, so what's going on with Mera in the upcoming DC sequel?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's first trailer barely features Amber Heard as Mera, the chief love interest of the titular hero Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa). This has likely created some confusion as to why she's not more prominently featured and what her role might be in the upcoming DCEU sequel. However, there's likely a collection of factors behind Heard hardly being seen in the new movie's initial promotion.\nIn the first Aquaman movie from Warner Bros and DC Studios, Arthur Curry and Mera reunited after briefly interacting in 2017's Justice League. Working together to stop Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) from conquering the surface world, Mera and Arthur went on a journey to recover the Trident of Atlan which Arthur used to unite the Seven Kingdoms as its new king. To that end, the new trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom implies that Aquaman and Mera took their relationship further, even though Mera herself is barely in the trailer. Here is what's likely going on with Mera and actress Amber Heard in Aquaman 2.\nRelated: Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom: Cast, Story, & Everything We Know\nIn the first trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Arthur Curry is shown in his new status quo as King of the Seven Kingdoms. He's also featured as a new father with a newborn son, the implication being that he and Mera got married and had Arthur Curry Jr. However, Black Manta has returned with new power, having recovered the cursed Black Trident with the ability to seemingly resurrect the dead who then follow his command. Seeking revenge against Aquaman for the death of his father, Black Manta vows to kill Aquaman's entire family in the new footage.\nAs a result, this new trailer features multiple shots of Aquaman's family including his mother, father, and son. Based on the trailer alone, things are looking particularly bad for Aquaman's father Tom with the Amnesty Bay lighthouse in flames as Manta rallies his forces with the Black Trident. Furthermore, things definitely don't look good based on Black Manta's original comics' history, having been responsible for the deaths of both Arthur's father and his son while still a baby. As such, it's quite possible that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom could get very dark depending on how closely its story on-screen mirrors what's been seen on the page.\nAquaman's half-brother Orm is featured quite prominently as well with Aquaman releasing him from his prison to gain his help against Black Manta and his powerful new trident. As such, it's quite bizarre that Mera is only featured in a single shot that's easy to miss in the new trailer, seen striking a window while appearing to be trapped somewhere in Atlantis. While it's possible that Mera is being kept hidden to avoid a major plot point, some behind-the-scenes details help explain what's confirmed to be a more limited role for Amber Heard's Queen Mera compared to her past appearances in the DC Universe.\nRelated: Every Underwater Species In Aquaman 2\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's director James Wan recently spoke about Amber Heard and her reduced role in the new movie. According to Wan himself, the DC sequel was always going to have a stronger focus on Aquaman and Orm joining forces as estranged brothers and former rivals rather than Aquaman and Mera teaming as they did in the first movie. Having envisioned the first Aquaman film as \"a romance action-adventure movie\" for Arthur and Mera, the sequel will reportedly be a \"bromance\" instead as Arthur and Orm attempt to reconcile their differences to save the Seven Kingdoms.\nApparently, little room has been left for Queen Mera to be involved in the new quest to stop Black Manta, though she is confirmed to have some sort of role (however minimal it may be). Based upon the single shot of the trailer, it does look as though her life will be endangered thanks to Black Manta and his revenge quest against Aquaman. As such, perhaps Mera will be the one to die rather than Tom Curry or Arthur Jr. as a means of subverting expectations for the upcoming DC movie.\nThe deviation away from Mera likely comes from a desire to focus more on the film's villain beyond Aquaman's uneasy alliance with Orm. It certainly looks as though Black Manta in particular will be getting a much bigger spotlight following what many believed wasn't nearly enough screen time or focus in the first Aquaman. Thanks to the new Black Trident, Black Manta has clearly become far more powerful than he was in the first movie, looking to be more than capable of killing his nemesis and everything he loves (which could certainly include Mera). That being said, actress Amber Heard has argued that her role used to be more substantial.\nRelated: Black Manta's New Costume: 7 Biggest Changes In Aquaman 2 Explained\nDuring her very public court battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp over allegations of abuse and defamation, Heard claimed her role as Mera in Aquaman 2 was significantly reduced by Warner Bros. in response. Despite the aforementioned comments from James Wan to the contrary and testimony from DC Films president Walter Hamada citing a lack of chemistry with Momoa, Heard believed her role was a \"very pared down version\" of what it originally was with multiple action scenes having been taken out, implying that it was the result of her ongoing court battle and the allegations being made by both her and Depp regarding each other's alleged misconduct during their relationship.\nBy all accounts, it does not seem as though the trial between Heard and Depp had very little to do with Mera's smaller role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom compared to the size of her role in the first film. Not only should the comments from Wan and Hamada be taken into account, but it's also worth noting that filming for the sequel wrapped in January 2022, three months before the beginning of Heard and Depp's demotion trial. It certainly looks as though Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was always going to have a shifted focus away from Mera long before the lawsuits.\n"}
{"title": "If You Love Amazon's The Boys, There's a Comic You Need to Read... But It's Not The Boys", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Fans of Amazon's streaming series The Boys who may find the original comics too extreme should check out this alternative Garth Ennis comic.\nThe Boys is known for its over-the-top humor, but for fans of the Amazon streaming series, the original comics may be a bit too extreme. But there is a comic-book option for fans looking for an even better Garth Ennis alternative: his DC Comics series Hitman.\nLaunched in 2006 under the DC imprint WildStorm, The Boys was created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. Telling the story of a group of government operatives trained to keep vain and out-of-control superheroes in line, the series positioned itself to be the ultimate taboo-breaking dark superhero parody — so much so that DC Comics eventually canceled the series after only a handful of issues. Dynamite Entertainment then acquired the series, where it went on to run for 72 issues. While the TV show keeps comic’s irreverent tone, there are some elements of the original that haven’t aged as well and may prove too extreme for fans only familiar with the Amazon adaptation.\nFor those fans of The Boys looking to get into comics, a better alternative might be DC Comics’ Hitman, a 60-issue series created by Garth Ennis and John McCrea. The story stars Tommy Monaghan, a low-level hitman in Gotham City who gets super-powers after being attacked by an alien parasite. Now possessing X-ray vision and telepathy, Monaghan decides to specialize in taking contracts on super-humans and other supernatural threats, gaining the ire of heroes like Batman along the way. The series is laced with the same biting superhero satire that made The Boys a success, but it's still not quite as extreme as that boundary-pushing series.\nThis isn’t to say that Hitman is any less violent or profane. True to Garth Ennis form, the adventures of Tommy Monaghan range from the bleak to the hilarious (and one memorable encounter with a zombie plague in the Gotham Aquarium). While Tommy Monaghan routinely makes fun of superheroes and their inherent jingoistic attitudes, the character later confesses to having a deep respect for Superman, even going so far as cheering Superman up after he failed saving someone from a burning building. Aside from all that, Hitman is just plain funny, with several hilarious take-downs like the Daredevil-inspired “Blind Bastard” or the future version of the ridiculous hero Gunfire accidentally turning his backside into a hand grenade.\nWhile Monaghan’s adventures come to a pretty definitive end after the conclusion of his solo series, Garth Ennis and John McCrea would later return to many of his supporting cast in works like All-Star Section Eight and Six-Pack and Dogwelder: Hard Travellin’ Heroez. Of course, The Boys has grown beyond its juvenile origins to be the type of carefully-considered character study that Garth Ennis excels at. But for those fans looking for something less extreme, they couldn’t do any worse than DC Comics’ Hitman.\n"}
{"title": "The New Writers Deal Is Starting A Content Arms Race As Hollywood Studios Catch Up", "date": "2023-10-02 22:30:27", "text": "Now that the WGA strike is over, the Hollywood machine is starting to work again, meaning we can expect a lot of big movie and TV news soon.\nThe Writers Guild of America strike finally coming to an end means the new deal could start a content arms race as writers return to work. After months of striking, the WGA and Hollywood studios have finally reached a deal allowing members to resume writing movies and TV shows and engage in negotiations for new projects, meaning there could be a rush of new project announcements as studios are finally able to finalize deals needed to green-light stagnant projects.\nThe writers strike began after talks with studios on a new deal fell through due to major sticking points such as streaming data transparency, streaming residual structures, restrictions on studio use of AI in movie and TV writing, and more. Fortunately, most of those issues have been addressed in the new WGA basic agreement, meaning writers can begin writing again and Hollywood's temporary standstill comes to an end.\nRelated: Why Writers' New Streaming Residuals Are So Different From TV & Movies\nThe 2023 WGA strike started on May 2nd and ended on July 27th, during which time all writers ceased ongoing work and halted discussions for future work, putting many productions on halt. The beginning of the SAG strikes in the middle of July slowed production down even more. In addition to freezing active projects, this also meant contract talks for future projects could begin or be finalized during that period. Putting movie and TV production on ice for long enough eventually gave the writers the leverage they needed to get the deal they wanted from the studios, and with SAG discussions ongoing, hopefully, actors' demands will be similarly satisfied soon.\nDue to a halt in negotiations, some big franchise plans had to be put on hold, especially for big cinematic universes like DC Studios and the MCU, where numerous projects are constantly in development. Now that writers can resume negotiations, expect a rush of project announcements and rumors to begin again as Hollywood tries to make up for lost time. This can already be seen with reports such as news of an incoming X-Men movie from the MCU. While news about actors won't start until the SAG strikes come to an end, you can expect an arms race to lock up writing talent as the Hollywood machine spins back up again.\nWhile the end of the strikes will likely result in a brief surge of project announcements, that doesn't mean Hollywood will necessarily return to full speed immediately. 2023 has also seen a number of massive flops from big-budget content, meaning some studios may be rethinking their blockbuster plans or slowing down development on future projects as they reconsider their approach. So, while a number of in-development projects were halted for a few months are finally going to start generating headlines thanks to the conclusion of the strikes, that may not be indicative of the kind news cycle to expect in the coming months.\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Powerful X-Men Comics Characters Right Now", "date": "2023-10-02 22:30:27", "text": "The X-Men have some of the most powerful characters around, from reality warping to magical manipulation, making the Fall of X era unlike any other.\nOut of all of Marvel's many superhero franchises, perhaps the most diverse and powerful cast are that of the X-Men, whose characters both heroic and evil could single-handedly devastate the planet if they chose to. From subtle but shockingly brutal heroes like Kate Pryde to magically manipulative clones like Mother Righteous, the X-Men universe is filled with characters unlike any other.\nThe X-Men are currently experiencing the horrific Fall of X era, with the mutant heroes scattered throughout the cosmos after a bloody defeat at the hands of the mutantphobic organization Orchis. As the mutant's war against Orchis is waged on multiple fronts, a handful of X-Men characters have clearly been established as the most powerful of the current era. Unsurprisingly, many of these iconically powerful mutants are women, and most of the mutants on this list are considered Omega-level, meaning there has been no recorded upper limit to their abilities.\nThe X-Men's Kate Pryde has often used her phase-shifting powers for defensive maneuvering, but time and time again she has shown the truly devastating impact her ability can have. The Fall of X era has Kate, who has long been a voice of peace and reason on Krakoa's now-defunct Quiet Council, once again donning her ninja persona and becoming Shadowkat, to take down Orchis from the shadows. Pryde is now the only living person who can use the Krakoan Gates, a huge advantage against Orchis, and her grief at the fall of Krakoa has been reflected in her increased brutality, viciously murdering a group of Orchis soldiers without any hesitation.\nCharles Xavier's son David Haller, better known as Legion, was a long-time villain of the X-Men until he gained control over his multiple personalities and stabilized his powers in X-Men Legacy. Since the Krakoan Age Legion has been an outright hero, creating the life-saving astral plane on Krakoa called the Altar, and helping to protect the mutant nation repeatedly. Legion's vast reality-warping abilities would be invaluable against Orchis, but unfortunately, David disappeared from the universe during a battle with Mother Righteous. Hopefully, Legion - who is surely still alive somewhere in the Multiverse - makes an appearance once again during the Fall of X to help save Krakoa and beat Orchis once and for all.\n Bobby Drake, better known as Iceman, is an Omega-level mutant capable of vast negative temperature manipulation, with no upper limit to his control over freezing water. Designated as \"Omega Two\" by Nimrod, Iceman has shown just how powerful he is in the Fall of X era. After being seemingly murdered by Nimrod at the Hellfire Gala, Bobby's partner Romeo was able to reconstitute him out of his dispersed vapor in the air, proving that Iceman is practically immortal. Since then, Bobby has been using his endless ice powers to assault Orchis from all sides, fighting back against his evil oppressors.\nThe mutant-hunting Sentinel robot Nimrod has been an enemy of the X-Men for decades, leading to the annihilation of mutantkind across multiple Multiverses and timelines. The creation of Nimrod is inevitable in every universe, and Nimrod coming online is often the first sign of a coming mutant genocide. Orchis was finally able to bring Nimrod online, and since then the devastatingly intelligent and powerful advanced Sentinel has defeated the X-Men on multiple occasions. Most recently Nimrod slaughtered the newly announced X-Men at the Hellfire Gala and almost murdered Iceman. The X-Men have a lot to fear from Orchis, and Nimrod is one of their most terrifying and formidable allies.\nMother Righteous, recently revealed to be a clone of Mister Sinister's late wife Rebecca, is one of the more intriguing X-Men villains in recent years because of her penchant for magic. Righteous has thus far kept her villainy a secret from most of the X-Men, gaining their trust and favor through the Sins of Sinister timeline. Mother Righteous is able to manipulate and control people by getting them to thank her, giving her immense power over the many Krakoans who gave her thanks after SOS. The full history and power of Righteous' magic is unknown, but she is one of Krakoa's biggest threats of the modern age and is well on her way to achieving her goal of reaching \"Dominion\" status.\nIsca the Unbeaten is one of the most fascinating Arakki mutants to debut during the X-Men's Krakoan Age, due to her disloyal and unrepentant personality, and her devastatingly powerful mutant ability. Isca, who is the younger sister of Genesis, is unable to lose... ever. Her Omega-level ability seems to be reality-warping in nature, because while sometimes Isca will simply be given the skills she needs to win, other times the world around her literally shifts, allowing her to never lose. That being said, Isca's overconfidence will always be her downfall, as the brash mutant can still be manipulated by those around her for their own purposes.\nOroro Munroe has always been a Goddess, and Storm's time as leader of the Brotherhood of Arakko has reestablished her role as X-Men leader and Omega-level icon. Storm has accomplished an almost endless supply of spectacular feats since the dawn of the Krakoan Age, and the highly respected former Queen continues to astonish. During the Fall of X Storm is going head-to-head with Genesis as she wages war on Storm's Brotherhood and the rest of Arakko to gain control over the mutant planet. Ororo's weather manipulation, strategic prowess, and compassion are unmatched in modern Marvel Comics, and Storm will surely continue to be the hero mutantkind needs for years to come.\nGenesis - wife of Apocalypse, mother of the original Horsemen, and ruler of Amenth - has emerged as one of the X-Men's most powerful enemies during the Krakoan Age, first acting as a major antagonist of the X of Swords event. Genesis who is an Omega-level manipulator of plant life, is also the wielder of the Annihilation Staff after the Golden Helm of Annihilation was transformed by Saturnyne. Annihilation's power allows her to control the demonic hordes of Amenth and manipulate the wills and desires of those around her, making her a wildly dangerous foe. In the Fall of X era the ancient warrior is waging war against Storm and her Brotherhood for control of planet Arakko, proving Genesis is a brutal force to be reckoned with.\nAn Omega-level universal seer and member of Arakko's Great Ring, Lactuca the Knower has powers similar in some ways to the X-Men's Manifold. Like Manifold, Lactuca is a \"Universal Shaper\" - the highest level of reality manipulator - and is able to sing to the universe to communicate with it, considering the universe to be their \"mother.\" Lactuca has vast powers like universal communication, teleportation, flight, and most importantly spatial omnipotence, allowing them to know the position of all things in the universe and see everything at once. Lactuca is the one mutant that Genesis fears, as Genesis is unwilling to battle Lactuca after they teleport Storm and her allies away from the Great Ring.\nJean Grey has always been one of the X-Men's most powerful heroes, particularly after gaining a connection to the ancient primordial entity known as the Phoenix Force, which has made Jean into what many consider a cosmic deity. Known as \"Omega One\" to Nimrod and Orchis, Jean's endless empathic, telepathic, and telekinetic abilities make her an incredibly formidable fighter, and her connection to the Phoenix has made her essentially immortal. While Jean was killed by Moira X at the Hellfire Gala she has remained alive in astral form, most likely in the Phoenix's White Hot Room, and is soon set to return to Immortal X-Men, perhaps once again in full control of the Phoenix Force's primordial power.\nThe X-Men have always been home to vastly powerful heroes and villains, but the Fall of X era has really ramped up the displays of Omega-level powers and unrepentant violence, from both sides of the battle lines. From magical manipulation to reality warping, to being the avatar for a cosmic entity, the X-Men's many characters have perhaps never been more powerful, or more ready to use their incredible abilities to defeat their enemies.\n"}

Christian, a 30-year-old from Minnesota, described himself as the life of the party in episode 4 of season 6 of the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Christian said he liked to drink cocktails and loved to make people laugh. He’s been called “starry-eyed Christian” for moving too fast in relationships. During the pandemic, Christian even eloped with a woman, only for him to get the marriage annulled later that year.\nChristian fell for Cleo, who is originally from Italy and lives in London, while he was scrolling on Instagram. Cleo has autism and is a trans woman. Christian had apprehensions about meeting Cleo in person, mostly because his family judged her. Christian took a while to show intimacy towards Cleo. He also tried to flirt with other women in her presence and lied to the cameras when asked if he and Cleo had slept together. Cleo still managed to forgive Christian for his mistakes. They stayed together through the finale to the Tell All, becoming one of the few successful couples of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6.\nChristian proposed to Cleo on the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Tell All Part 2. Before he professed his love to Cleo and asked her to be his wife, Christian also made their relationship official on Instagram. Shortly after Part 1 of the reunion aired on TV, Christian posted about Cleo on his IG. He shared a photo of the two of them clinking cocktail glasses. “Cat’s out of the bag! I can finally post about Cleo and I without spoiling it for y’all fans of the show!,” Christian wrote in his caption. The photo was not taken when Christian went to England to meet Cleo but was taken during her visit to America.\nChristian has a lot of secrets up his sleeve, including things he’s never revealed to the audience on the show. This includes the persona that he sometimes puts online. In one such post, Christian dressed up as a “U.S. Secret Service agent on the Kennedy detail” for his Instagram. Christian’s black and white photo fetched him several compliments from his followers.\nChristian’s flirty behavior didn’t get a stamp of approval from his cast members. For instance, Amanda Wilhelm called him out for trying to make excuses to justify his actions. She wanted him to admit what he did was wrong. “I just don’t see it,” said Christian. But Christian also hung out with Amanda and the rest of his cast members from America in New York after the Tell All for cocktails. “I'm so glad I met everybody and had a chance to connect with them personally,” Christian wrote about a group photo with his co-stars. He called them wonderful people who put themselves out there.\nChristian also showed off his dancing skills on Instagram to his friends and followers in a September 2023 post. Christian captioned the photo “Shana Tova!” which is a popular phrase that means \"Happy New Year\" and directly translates to \"Good New Year\" in Hebrew. Christian performed a traditional dance with a friend in the picture and seemed to be fully immersed in the act when the photo was clicked. Several fans wished Christian a happy new year in his comments section.\nChristian considers camping one of his pastimes. Christian’s Instagram does reveal a different side to him than what he chose to portray himself as while meeting Cleo. Perhaps things would have been different if Cleo was the one to come to America and Christian was the one showing her around. When Christian posted a video from one of his camping trips to Northern Minnesota, he showed a raging river and declared that he would rather stay there than in “civilization.” Not to be missed was Christian’s tough and rough look with a shaggy beard, a beanie, and large, yellow aviators.\nChristian’s introduction on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days showed him getting ready for a Halloween party at a friend’s place. Christian dressed up as “Chet Steiner,” a 70’s newsman. He donned a red wig and a blue suit with an orange shirt and interviewed the guests at the party as he chugged on beer and showed off his '70s dance moves. Christian surely loves to dress up and is skilled at mimicry, and in a post from August 6, 2023, he did just that. Christian imitated Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead as he mouthed, “There’s walkers… out there… Carol, watch out.”\nChristian leaves no stone unturned to prove that he brings the party with him wherever goes. With an interest in cocktails and an affinity for alcohol, Christian loves sharing his favorite kind of drink creations with the world as he flaunts his party lifestyle. In August 2023, Christian posted a stellar-looking cocktail on his Instagram page. The smoky drink was from Baldamar restaurant in Roseville, Minnesota. Christian wrote that the unique cocktail was called, “Smoky Old Fashioned: N.Y.F.O.F. (Not Your Father’s Old Fashioned).” Created using bourbon, the cocktail also used cherry liqueur with cherry wood smoke.\nThe wildest and eeriest post on Christian’s Instagram page is his Jack Torrance tribute.

{"title": "Big Brother 25 Week 9 Power Of Veto Ceremony Results (Spoilers)", "date": "2023-10-02 22:26:20", "text": "The Big Brother 25 week 9 Power of Veto ceremony has occurred. Find out if the winner used the veto to save Felicia or Mecole from the chopping block.\nWARNING! THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BIG BROTHER 25!\nThe Big Brother 25 Power of Veto ceremony has occurred, and winner and current Head of Household (HOH) Cameron Hardin didn't use it, leaving his original nominees, Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes on the chopping block. Cameron came roaring back into the Big Brother house after being evicted unanimously, winning the Do or Die competition, and resurrecting his game. He did this after besting Jared Fields in the Resurrection Rumble. He won HOH the same night he returned to the game, and then the Power of Veto two days later. This is Cameron's third HOH win of the season.\nThe Big Brother 25 live feeds have revealed that Cameron chose not to use the Power of Veto in order to save either Felicia or Mecole. Cameron had been considering backdooring Cory Wurtenberger, but said that he wouldn't do it if his Fugitive alliance members, Matt Klotz and Jag Bains weren't on board. While Matt was in favor of the idea, Jag had reservations, and didn't think they should evict Cory yet. Therefore, Cameron decided to follow through with his original plan to evict Felicia this week. Cameron told Bowie Jane that it would cause too much chaos in the house if he nominated Cory at the ceremony.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nDespite trying to convince Cameron that she's not a threat to him, and that she'd vote for him if she made it to the jury, Felicia was unsuccessful at making her pitch to him. Cameron told her that she might not be his biggest threat, but she is the biggest persuader in the house. He doesn't want her to go to the jury, and this is the last week before the Jury of 7 begins. Matt and Jag have an agreement with Cory and America Lopez, so it's no wonder that Jag wanted to keep Cory safe. Between Felicia and Mecole, the houseguests will almost certainly evict Felicia.\nCameron's second HOH was very shocking as he floored the houseguests by nominating Felicia and Izzy Gleicher instead of the expected Jag and Blue. However, this time, Cameron didn't have a reign of chaos, but instead had a much more straightforward approach. This is good gameplay for him, especially since he was unanimously evicted from the house last week. He's smart to play a bit more conservatively right now to ensure his safety when he's ineligible to play for the HOH next week as the outgoing one.\nIf Felicia exits the game, she'll join Kirsten Elwin, Reilly Smedley, Hisam Goueli, Red Utley, Izzy, and Jared as the houseguests who didn't make it to the jury. They're one of the strongest groups of pre-jury competitors in Big Brother history, and it's surprising that so many of them didn't make it to the jury. Felicia has had a great run on the show, and she's a fierce competitor. Perhaps she can turn things around before Thursday's live eviction and keep herself in the Big Brother 25 house longer.\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}
{"title": "5 Reasons The Rings Of Power Is Amazon Prime Video's Best Fantasy Show (& 5 It's The Wheel Of Time)", "date": "2023-10-02 22:21:29", "text": "Amazon has two great shows full of magic and adventure, The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time. But which one is the fantasy show to rule them all?\nAmazon Prime boasts two sprawling series The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time, each with their own strengths that make them the streaming network's best fantasy show. The Rings of Power focuses on important events during Middle-earth's Second Age that lead up to The Lord of the Rings movies, including the forging of the titular rings, the creation of Sauron's stronghold in Mordor, and the fall of Numenor. The Wheel of Time follows Moiraine, an Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah, who embarks on a quest to discover the identity of the Dragon Reborn, a great warrior prophesied to either save the world or cause its destruction.\nBoth series feature magic, exciting battles, the same directors (Sanaa Hamri), and extensive world-building based on beloved works of fiction by celebrated authors. Certain things like creative license, budgetary constraints, and character development have greatly impacted how they have both been received by fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth setting and Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's Randland from The Wheel of Time books. Both series have strengths and weaknesses that are giving them growing pains ahead of their respective second seasons, but there's no denying that fans of fantasy are fortunate to have so many options right now, on Amazon as well as other platforms.\nEven without the most recognizable faces in The Lord of the Rings franchise, The Rings of Power has several memorable characters. Not only does Galadriel make a huge impression as a much more battle-weary figure, but Elrond emerges as a loyal friend and budding politician whose thoughtful choices shape the fate of Middle-earth. While not every performance rings true, the vast majority of the actors give committed performances that pay homage to the material, with individual relationships, like the one between Elrond and Durin, that humanize larger-than-life figures and build a strong foundation for The Rings of Power season 2.\nLike The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time has a lot of source material to work with, but manages to be more faithful to it. Modifications, such as truncated time periods or, in the case of Matt and Perin, changes to character backstories and personalities can be explained in-universe with a few words of dialogue or dramatic motivations. It doesn't help that Amazon never obtained the rights for all the necessary Tolkien works before they attempted to adapt The Rings of Power and therefore had to ignore a large portion of it.\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise is known for its painstaking attention to detail thanks to a trilogy boasting handmade chainmaille armor on hundreds of extras and heroes wielding rune-carved blades forged by real blacksmiths. The high budget on The Rings of Power is unmistakable, even if at times it looks a little too pristine. Aesthetically, it's not only beautiful to watch, but distinct from other fantasy series, which are either too gritty like Game of Thrones and The Witcher, or too generic like The Wheel of Time.\nBecause it doesn't have to compress hundreds of years of actions and characters into a single narrative like The Rings of Power with the Second Age, The Wheel of Time has a better story. Not only is the pace better, but it's cohesive and linear without being too confusing even as it leaves circumstances surrounding Rand more mysterious and leaves casual fans wondering who the Dragon Born will be. Moraine is a strong lead character, and her goals sync up with all the supporting cast in ways that make sense, rather than trying to find ways to connect characters like Galadriel to less compelling characters, like the Harfoots, in The Rings of Power.\nWhile die-hard Tolkien fans will find a series based on appendices jarring, The Rings of Power does have a certain amount of creative freedom. The series builds a foundation for prominent events in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and aside from having to compress its time period by having certain characters alive who would have otherwise been separated by years, it isn't as constrained. The Wheel of Time has to turn 14 books, and some of them fairly massive, into a television show, while The Rings of Power has to hit certain milestones and then fabricate what happened between them.\nOne of the main problems with The Rings of Power is its pacing, which often comes across as plodding and monotonous. The Wheel of Time keeps things moving at a brisk clip, which translates into much higher completion rates for viewers. As a fantasy series, The Wheel of Time understands how to make episodic structure work for its overall narrative, rather than The Rings of Power's tendency to make some episodes completely disparate from others.\nWhereas The Wheel of Time stumbles with its CGI and Trollocs that don't look quite finished, The Rings of Power boasts incredible visual effects on par with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Rivendell and Numenor are dazzling, and every environment bursts with a vitality that makes Middle-earth seem real and lived in. Locations that were seen as dark ruins, like the Mines of Moria, are seen in all their glory, full of bustling industry and part of one of the most thrilling communities in the series that focuses on the dwarves.\nSauron is a formidable villain in The Lord of the Rings, but as he's presented in The Rings of Power, he's operating in the shadows as more of a charming puppet master. The Wheel of Time has villains that are not only more apparent, but also more entertaining to watch as they work out their schemes. The members of The Forsaken still have a lot of damage to do in Season 2, but watching powerful characters like Lanfear has given the series charismatic darkness to counteract the light.\nIt should come as no surprise that the battle sequences in The Rings of Power are as pulse-pounding as anything in The Lord of the Rings. Not only do they showcase grand special effects, but they also feature expert horsemanship, stuntwork, and practical strategic elements. On top of that, they're beautifully shot, making the violence and bloodshed at times almost like a fever dream, or in other cases, a nightmare of ash and flame.\nDialogue in fantasy series can often be ropey or overly verbose, with characters speaking in ways that don't flow naturally or make a lot of sense. The Wheel of Time includes dialogue that not only sounds how characters speak in the books but even lines verbatim from them that work in the appropriate situation. This helps keep it focused without lines that take viewers right out of the drama, which even the best fantasy series like The Rings of Power can't always prevent, but should make an effort to do so in order to remain immersive.\n"}
{"title": "Community Movie Gets Discouraging Update From Creator Dan Harmon Amid Production Setbacks", "date": "2023-10-02 22:16:39", "text": "Community creator Dan Harmon is worried the movie might not happen following the SAG-AFTRA strike after it was announced by Peacock last year.\nCommunity creator Dan Harmon is worried the movie might not happen after all. After years of fan campaigning under the hashtag #SixSeasonsandaMovie, it was finally announced in September 2022 that a Community movie was in development for Peacock featuring the return of original stars Joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Jim Rash, and Ken Jeong. However, the WGA and still ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes have caused a plethora of production setbacks and put those plans into serious doubt.\nNow, the latest Community movie update reveals that Harmon is concerned it might not happen at all. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Community creator admitted that once the SAG-AFTRA strike ends, he's worried the cast might not be able to get back together. In his own words, Harmon says, \"By the time we can recoordinate, what are the odds that everyone’s schedule is going to once again align?\"\nBefore the SAG-AFTRA strike, Harmon says the plan was to shoot the Community movie in Atlanta, which was moved from Los Angeles in order to accommodate Glover's return, \"And Donald was stoked,\" Harmon says. The actor's name was missing from the original announcement in September 2022, though there have been multiple updates suggesting he will return. Glover has several other commitments, including Prime Video's Mr. and Mrs. Smith series and the Star Wars Lando movie, and changing the shooting location to Atlanta was to prevent the Community movie from shooting \"separately at different months in different locations,\" Harmon explains.\nWith no conclusive end to the SAG-AFTRA strike in sight, it's uncertain if the Community cast will be able to reunite for the movie. Once the SAG-AFTRA strike does end, there will be a scramble in Hollywood to secure top talent. This includes Glover, but also McHale who stars in Fox's Animal Control, which was renewed for a season 2, and hosts reality competition series like Crime Scene Kitchen and House of Villains. In light of the stoppage started by the SAG-AFTRA strike, Harmon's comment casts some serious doubt on the fate of the long-anticipated Community movie.\nSource: THR\n"}

Krapopolis has only just started, with the series hitting the ground running. FOX has already renewed Krapopolis for two more seasons ahead of season 1, meaning that the show already has some pretty ambitious plans. While a lot of these details are still under wraps, one Krapopolis detail has fans eagerly awaiting the upcoming seasons.\nKrapopolis is the newest show from Community creator and Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon, with the new series bringing back many of the creative's signature trademarks and stylistic flairs. Krapopolis takes place in pre-civilization Ancient Greece, with the show following King Tyrannis as he attempts to start up the first Greek city. However, Tyrannis is constantly thwarted by his colorful family which includes his mother, the goddess Deliria, and his father, a Manitaur named Shlub.\nRelated: Krapopolis Season 2: Renewal, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nWhile only a handful of gods have appeared in Krapopolis so far, the series clearly has some ambitious plans, as around 120 gods have been designed for the first three seasons of the series. In Screen Rant's exclusive interview with Krapopolis supervising director Pete Michels and lead character designer Andy Ristaino, the duo touched on what's to come for the show's upcoming seasons. Here's what Michels and Ristaino had to say when asked about the show's future:\nPete Michels: [Krapopolis' main characters] do meet a lot of new characters in the upcoming seasons and a lot of new locations also.\nAndy Ristaino: Go to a lot of cool places. We visit more gods and stuff.\nPete Michels: A lot more gods. I think you’ve designed like 120 gods or something.\nAndy Ristaino: Yeah, I’ve designed a lot of gods and a lot of creatures and mythological creatures and things that were never mentioned.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and I think those are the fun things too because we do not just the gods and goddesses and the humans, but there's also monsters. [There are] a lot of interesting monsters that animation lends itself to that were just really fun to do and fun to draw.\nThis is major news, as only a select few gods from the Greek pantheon have appeared in Krapopolis so far. Obviously, more gods were expected to appear, but 120 is an immense number for only three seasons of the show. It's entirely possible that many of these gods and monsters may not make the final cut, but it is a sign of how expansive the world of Krapopolis is intended to be by season 3.\nWith around 120 gods having been designed, it seems like almost any ancient Greek god is fair game to appear in future seasons of Krapopolis. Some of the biggest names, like Hermes, Athena, Poseidon, and plenty of others have appeared. However, characters like Zeus and Hades as well as deep-cut gods that viewers may not know about could also appear. Michels and Ristaino didn't give us any specifics on which gods could pop up, but there are plenty of possibilities.\nRelated: Krapopolis: Concept, Trailer & Everything We Know About Dan Harmon's New Show\nAlthough it is still unknown what gods Krapopolis has in store for seasons 2 and 3, some future monsters have been confirmed. In the Krapopolis Q&A panel at SCAD AnimationFest 2023, Michels and Ristaino confirmed that Pegasus and a Hydra would appear in upcoming episodes of the series. While other monsters and creatures are sure to appear, this is big news for fans of the series, giving viewers something to look forward to in the future of Krapopolis.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

{"title": "10 Reasons Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof Is His Biggest Failure", "date": "2023-10-02 22:00:28", "text": "Quentin Tarantino's weakest movie is Death Proof, his only horror movie to date, and there are different reasons why it didn't succeed.\nDeath Proof marked a first in Quentin Tarantino’s career as it’s his only horror movie to date, and it’s also his biggest failure. Quentin Tarantino has become one of the best filmmakers of his generation but also one of the most controversial due to the violence in every one of his movies. Still, Tarantino’s works have been praised for their narrative and visual style, his mastery in writing dialogue, and more, and though some of his movies are considered among the best films ever made, some haven’t had the same success.\nIn 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez teamed up to bring Grindhouse, a double feature that combined Rodriguez’s horror comedy Planet Terror and Tarantino’s Death Proof, a slasher thriller. Death Proof followed Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who used his death-proof car to kill young women, as the car was only safe for him. Death Proof is widely considered Tarantino's worst movie, and even Tarantino himself admits it’s his weakest movie – and here are 10 reasons Death Proof was a failure.\nAs part of the Grindhouse project, Death Proof has the visual style of grindhouse and exploitation movies from the 1970s, but unlike its sibling film, Planet Terror, Death Proof didn’t stick to this aesthetic. The first part of Death Proof is in full grindhouse style, with bright colors and the style of an old movie. The beginning of the second part of the story is in black and white, and it suddenly changes to color and good quality, leaving the grindhouse look behind. While this can be explained as part of the Grindhouse project's aesthetic, it gave Death Proof an inconsistent look that, ultimately, impacted the overall quality of the movie and its reception.\nOne of the most praised elements in Quentin Tarantino’s movies is the dialogue. Tarantino’s ability to write dialogue has been praised, which is often heavy on pop culture references, and it’s key in understanding the dynamics, motivations, and personalities of the characters. Death Proof, however, and unlike Tarantino’s previous works, has more dialogue between female characters, as the main characters are all women. Tarantino used the same style he had used for all his male characters in Death Proof’s female ones, which felt off and brought out a weakness in Tarantino’s writing. \nThe first part of Death Proof follows Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd), and Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) who meet Stuntman Mike at a bar, where he claims a lap dance from Arlene that Jungle Julia promised on her radio show. Later, an old friend of Julia, Pam (Rose McGowan), takes Stuntman Mike’s offer for a ride home, but he kills her by speeding and slamming on the brakes. Stuntman Mike then catches up with Julia and company, crashing into their car, and killing them in truly gruesome ways.\nThe second half of Death Proof sees Stuntman Mike targeting a new group of women, but to his surprise, they know how to fight back. However, this second half is slower and lacks the suspense of the first part of Death Proof, to the point where many viewers have shared that they lost interest in the characters and stories throughout the second half of the movie.\nDeath Proof spends enough time with Jungle Julia and her friends in the first part of the movie to make the audience care about them, but the same can’t be said about the second group. While they end up being the heroes of the movie, Death Proof doesn’t do much to make the audience care about them and what will happen to them next, and the character of Stuntman Mike isn’t properly developed, leading to the audience not even caring about the villain. The heroes aren’t exactly likable, either, leaving the audience with no one to really root for.\nQuentin Tarantino is no stranger to starting his movies with a bang, but what happened with Death Proof is that it never recovered from its shocking first act. The rest of Death Proof sees Stuntman Mike going after Abernathy (Rosario Dawson), Kim (Tracie Thomas), and Zoë (Zoë Bell), but the chase and the women’s revenge take too long to happen and reach their peak. Death Proof starts to take off again towards the end, but never truly does so as the movie comes to an end when the women finally get their revenge.\nDeath Proof is considered a slasher movie even if it doesn’t go all the way, but even if it just took the structure of a slasher movie, it still didn’t deliver on that promise. Death Proof leans more towards an action thriller, and though Stuntman Mike’s murders are very graphic and horrible, especially those of Jungle Julia and her friends, Death Proof doesn’t really feel like a slasher movie. Still, Death Proof is considered Quentin Tarantino’s only horror movie to date, even if it falls short.\nDeath Proof’s slow pace made the climax and ending pretty underwhelming. As mentioned above, the movie takes too long to set up the Abernathy and friends' conflict with Stuntman Mike, and by the time they can finally get their revenge, the movie ends. The big moment of Abernathy, Kim, and Zoë beating an injured Stuntman Mike ended up being more comedic than exciting, and the movie ends as Stuntman Mike falls and the women celebrate their win. Of course, this deeply affected Death Proof’s reception with critics and viewers, making it a forgettable movie.\nBy itself, Death Proof still wouldn’t have succeeded, but its failure was made worse by its sibling film, Planet Terror. Unlike Death Proof, Planet Terror fully embraced the horror genre with its zombie apocalypse story and its very graphic scenes. Planet Terror had a consistent visual style, its characters were developed enough for the audience to root for them, and it was packed with action from beginning to end. Planet Terror also had a proper ending, and even had a small tease at the end (though that will never pay off).\nAlthough the idea of a double-feature B-movie style project like Grindhouse sounds interesting, it risked only appealing to a specific audience, even if it counted on the talents of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Rodriguez delivered on the horror/grindhouse style of the project with Planet Terror, while Tarantino made his interpretation of a slasher movie that, ultimately, would only be exciting for him. Surely, Tarantino ended up admitting that Death Proof isn’t his best work, but in big part, the movie’s failure was because it wouldn’t really appeal to a wide audience, like his other projects.\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Death Proof is that it doesn’t feel like a Quentin Tarantino movie because his style doesn’t fit the movie. As mentioned above, Tarantino’s style of dialogue didn’t fit the female characters, and his trademark long speeches felt off with the overall style of Death Proof. Surely, Tarantino’s style of violence was perfect for it, but that’s about it. Death Proof could have benefited from having Quentin Tarantino as producer, a better script, and a different director, but that wasn’t the case.\n"}

Set in the Northern Great Plains in 1719, the movie follows Naru, an accomplished Comanche healer and tracker who yearns to become a warrior. Although overshadowed by her brother Taabe, a skilled hunter, Naru sees her chance for the big hunt, a rite of passage in her tribe. Naru will face a much more sinister and dangerous threat than anything she or the others have seen before.\nPrey is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and written by Patrick Aison. The movie is produced by John Davis, Jhane Myers, and Marty P. Ewing. Prey stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Dane DiLiegro, Michelle Thrush, Stormee Kipp, Julian Black Antelope, and Bennett Taylor.\nRelated: Predator: 8 Ways Arnold Schwarzenegger Can Appear In Prey 2 Despite A 268-Year Gap\nScreen Rant spoke with director Dan Trachtenberg about his installation in the Predator franchise, Prey. He discussed shooting on location and revealed how sports movies were an inspiration. Trachtenberg also broke down the importance of showing the Predator lore to a new audience and tapping into an earlier era of this world.\nScreen Rant: Dan, look, I love Prey! I'm so happy. I got to revisit it over this weekend. October 3, it's coming in 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD. I'm sure everyone can't wait. Can you talk about the world-building and why you decided to start at the beginning of the Predator story?\nDan Trachtenberg: I don't even know if it's the beginning of the Predator story. Great point. It is the beginning of this Predator, the Predator in this movies needs the first time he's ever been to Earth, or it's ever been to Earth. Frankly, I did not come at it from thinking of \"Oh, I'd like to make a Predator movie. What Predator movie could I make? Oh, what if I went to a different...\" It actually was thinking of Naru's story and trying to thinking of a movie that could be as nonverbal as possible, just as action oriented as possible, but also wanting to feel as emotional as that possibly could.\nSo I thought of an underdog story. Taking the engine from a sports film and putting that into this other kind of genre. And then what is your protagonist that we never see? Native American and Comanche in particular. And all of those thoughts, while still wanting for it to have a science fiction component. Period and sci-fi coming together has not always been successful. I was really trying to figure out, well, is there a way that it could be? And that's when Predator came to mind because it wouldn't just be arbitrary and look at the science fiction thing. Actually the predators thematic, that it goes on hunts looking for the strongest thing, and we'd already be focusing on a character whose peers are saying, \"You're not, you're not it.\" And she's wanting to be it and also was questioning herself in my head.\nAnd the Predator doesn't even look at her doesn't even consider her, that was like, okay, cool. That is a movie that doesn't feel like I'm just throwing a hat on that, that really feels like a great mixture. And then it was like, okay, well wait, if this is set in the 1700s and that means that'd be before Predator. Actually, I should say before it was even 1700s it was just, what is pre... As early as possible I wanted to tell a story about this people in this culture that we don't often see usually it's in the 1800s. It's in the western. I just want to be focused on them.\nAnd then I realized there was that gun in Predator 2. I was in the shower when I was thinking, and as soon as I got in the shower I ran to my phone to Google, what was the date on the gun? It's 1715, and it was like, \"Holy crap, there!\" We perfected it beautifully aligned with Predator lore, and what I was already interested in doing with the film.\nThat is incredible. That is incredible that you had that thought in the shower, and had that foresight in mind. I love this character of Naru. Can you talk about how you wanted to differentiate her strength from the other members of the tribe? And also how you wanted to differentiate her from other Predator heroes we've seen in the past?\nDan Trachtenberg: What I love, even though I'm not physically represented at all on screen except for maybe I have a beard now so then there's a bunch of bearded people, this was a very personal story for me. It's my feelings. My heart is beating in the movie. Why I wanted to put it out there, why I'm always interested in this kind of stories. I think that a lot of people feel the way that Naru feels. A lot of people feel like they are capable of more than is outwardly seen yet also question and hope that they have that within them, and hope they have the guts to prove it to themselves and to others.\nIt's why we we do sports. It's why we pursue careers with any sense of ambition. I think anywhere you are in the world that's a very specific feeling that is felt by, I would imagine, almost all of us. So that is why I focused on her. That kind of story is very different than the kind of protagonist that we certainly saw on the original Predator. Arnold represents the wish fulfillment. It's like, oh, I'm watching that and saying, \"Wouldn't it be great if I had all those muscles? If I was that way? Could I kick it?\"\nJust exhilarating to see a character kick butt on screen that is Uber capable. And Naru is the other thing and that is, what if I was there? What if I, but just a little bit better, but could I pull it off? Could I be posed with a seemingly impossible task, still rise to the occasion, figure it out, and handle it? So yeah, that's kind of how that came together.\nWhen I originally watched Prey, when it first came out on Hulu, my girlfriend had never seen the Predator movies before. So this is kind of a new way to introduce such a famous character to her. Were there any elements you wanted to set up with Prey for people who hadn't seen Predator before?\nDan Trachtenberg: Actually the first cut of the movie we did not do our job in making it for people who had not seen Predator. Really took for granted what the rules are of a Predator and so we had to kind of learn the hard way after screening for some friends and family that we had missed that. We very much wanted this to be for anyone. For it to be great movie first and then a kick ass Predator movie second. So what we found was we really need to make sure the movie retaught the audience that it was an alien coming to earth looking for the Alpha following the hierarchy of Predator and Prey on this planet and a Trophy Hunter.\nBefore we articulated that in the movie there was a reaction to the sequence where it kills the bear or someone thought it was a vampire. Because they thought it was drinking the blood of the bear before we had sequences that were it studying the ant, the snake and getting the skull of the wolf and attaching to it. So before those kinds of things were in the movie. It was like \"Oh, I don't know what this is. The shimmering red thing and then it drinks blood.\" So anyway, it took a few unfortunate reminders that this must be a movie for everyone, of course, and we need to make sure all that lore that is established in the other films we have in this one as well.\nWell, it worked because after that I think we binged the next two Predator movies. So it absolutely worked. Now Prey explores intense survival themes. How did you approach capturing the psychological aspects of the character in such a gripping manner?\nDan Trachtenberg: Making sure the movie was very linked to Naru's POV. To making it a very experiential film. So we really only see in large part what Naru sees. Hear and feel it as best we can. So playing with sound, focusing on the noises that she would focus in on, and letting the suspense build around her and towards her. As opposed to it being like the other Predator films [which] are a little bit more of a classic slasher film approach. Where you're meeting a team of people and watching them killed by one. This is a much more specific, single protagonist oriented movie. Which just makes it all feel that much more emotional, and the suspense matters so much more because you care about her and her specific relationships.\nSpeaking of that, this film has such a unique blend of suspense and horror. How did you balance maintaining the tension throughout the story without overwhelming the audience?\nDan Trachtenberg: What I loved about the original Predator was for me growing up, it was the first time I'd seen a real genre combination. That was combining sci-fi, horror, and action. What I love about Prey is that it was a combination of science fiction, horror, and adventure. Adventure films are not a genre that we have too much of these days. Growing up, we had a lot of them, we had a lot of quicksand, slide, swinging from things, and swashbuckle.\nSo I wanted to infuse this movie with a bit of that language as well. Have moments of score that remind us of big epics, that, that I grew up with. So I think that and certainly her relationship with her dog and her relationship with her brother, all the emotional story makes the tension matter more. And then also, when it follows through with the with the action, it's much more of a cathartic release. Because everything's been building up and building up and building up.\nCan you talk about the usage of practical effects and visual effects, and combining them both? Knowing when to us which one when the story called for it?\nDan Trachtenberg: Digital effects when it is literally impossible to do anything practically. Almost the whole movie was shot on location. So there was there was a lot on screen that is in camera. CG stuff was used to just augment what was there from landscape to snowfall to ash in the sky,. There's a bit that I love that we've mentioned in the commentary in the movie that I'd forgotten about through the whole process of releasing the film, that was a big deal while we were making the movie, where Amber, when she climbs out of the water. After escaping from the Predator, she was wearing a wetsuit that was covering her arms. And it was very obvious and unfortunate that we had no other take because it was something that we were just racing to get there. In this pretty gnarly location at the bottom of a ravines and stuff.\nSo we were kind of screwed until we found an awesome digital artist who just in 2D found a way to comp skin onto her arms. So her arms are digital effect in that scene. I don't think many people realize that or would notice that. And then there's bits where to make the predator more believable. it's all suit except when it's hands. We're very tight on his hands and it's sniffing ash know that CG hands because his hands weren't articulating, in the most refined way and sometimes we augmented some of the mandibles and the face here and there. Sometimes that's really just it.\nSo it's always playing a little bit of a zigzag game. You never know when it's going to be practical when it's gonna be real. So when you're seeing a thing, hopefully you're kind of lulled into it and tricked. And I would argue the moments that are blatantly CG are that way because there's no element of practicality to it. What we're at what we're doing is so physically impossible. So it sort of proves that the methodology is sound. That most people don't notice are those that were really combining both things.\nLook, I love home entertainment releases because of audio commentaries. And you have a great one with you. Amber Midthunder, Jeff Cutter, Angela M. Catanzaro. I love audio commentaries, because it's almost like going to film school in a way. It's hearing it from your guys's perspective. If there's an audio commentary that you'd like young filmmakers to check out, what would be your choice?\nBy the way, it was my film school. Audio commentaries.\nWas it really? \nDan Trachtenberg: Oh, yeah. I mean, I also went to film school but I think I learned as much if not more from listening to audio commentaries growing up than I did from movies. There's several that come to mind that were personal to me that I enjoy listening to that I would said, Well, that's probably not the most formative. I think David Fincher did some awesome commentaries. Steven Soderbergh.\nI remember Traffic having a whole walkthrough of their post process that's sort of beyond commentary. It was showing you the AVID if memory serves on the disk that was really insightful. It's a great question there's probably so many more but yeah I would look to the Fincher and the Soderbergh. I remember Nightmare Before Christmas also having a commenter, I think I got that before DVDs, that was super interesting. I remember having a VHS of commentary version that I got to like a comic convention or something, probably was bootlegged.\nSet in the Comanche Nation 300 years ago, this is the story of Naru, a fierce and highly skilled warrior, raised in the shadow of legendary hunters who roam the Great Plains. When danger threatens her camp, she sets out to protect her people. The prey she stalks: a highly evolved alien predator with a technically advanced arsenal.\nPrey is available on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 3.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "Karl Saint Lucy & Marius de Vries On The Songs & Music Of Dicks: The Musical", "date": "2023-10-02 21:56:34", "text": "Dicks: The Musical songwriters and composers Karl Saint Lucy and Marius de Vries talk turning an unhinged UCB one-act into A24’s first musical.\nDicks: The Musical is somehow even more wild than its name implies, making A24’s first musical feel like a big swing for the production company. It’s a gamble that audiences will likely be glad A24 took; what began roughly a decade ago as a musical performed in a cramped Upright Citizens Brigade theater in Manhattan has morphed into a film that aims for the heart as much as humor. The movie was written by Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp--also its stars and the creators of the UCB musical--and directed by Larry Charles (Borat). \nJackson and Sharp were also the songwriters behind Dicks: The Musical, though they had help. Songwriter and composer Karl Saint Lucy has worked with the pair since their UCB days and returns for the film along with Marius de Vries, an Oscar-winning composer whose previous work includes CODA, Kick-Ass, and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet. Together, the film’s songwriters have crafted catchy and hilarious pieces for the film’s cast, which includes Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Megan Thee Stallion.\nRelated: The 20 Best Musicals Of All Time\nKarl Saint Lucy and Marius de Vries spoke with Screen Rant about their work on Dicks: The Musical, working with Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally, and more. Note: This interview was conducted during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, and the film covered here would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. This interview has also been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nScreen Rant: Karl, I believe you did the stage version of this back at UCB in New York. I'm sure it had to be expanded, but how much changed once more people started getting involved and you had to start thinking about putting it on screen?\nKarl Saint Lucy: Oh, I mean, just about everything. There’s very little from that show that exists in the same form than it did. One of the things that I thought was going to be a challenge when they made it into full-length show is that it was a 30-minute UCB show--all of those shows are, like, 30 minutes long--so a lot of those jokes and the comedy had to do with the fact that they're changing wigs and everything is happening so quickly. So, initially I didn't think it was going to work, because I was like, \"Oh my God, the center of the comedy of the show is the fact that it's so time limited.\" But they worked on it with Larry for a really long time, and I think they did a great job.\nMarius, how did you find your way here?\nMarius de Vries: I was introduced to Josh and Aaron something like seven years ago by our lead producer Kori at Chernin, and at that point the movie was up and in development at 20th Century Fox, back when it was 20th Century Fox, which gave me some pause. I wondered, as things came to fruition, whether someone at Fox might notice that it's not something that they perhaps would want representing the Fox brand. I just had a suspicion that that might be the case. And then, of course Disney came along, and my suspicions were redoubled and indeed right, because we lost that connection. But thank God we did, because we found a new parent in A24 who were nothing but supportive and just allowed us to cause the maximum amount of mayhem without interfering. So hats off to them for their courage and patience in that regard.\nThere was a period where the whole thing was asleep, and we didn't have a director. Then, they found Larry, recontacted me, I picked up the thread, and then we just rolled our sleeves up and started making it. It was a long and twisty journey, but I knew from that first meeting I had in Silver Lake with the twins seven years ago [that] there was something really special here, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to see it through.\nHow did the collaboration work between the two of you and the two of them? Did they do all the lyrics and did you two do the orchestrations?\nKarl Saint Lucy: The lyrics are by the boys. I wrote the melodies and harmonies of the songs. I did most of the orchestration of the songs. Marius, of course, was the music producer for all the songs, and was a hugely influential part of the songwriting process as we did that, and helped to punch up the orchestrations and everything once we were in post-production. Then the score, really, is a marriage of our work. A lot of it is thematic, so it pulls materials from the songs, and Marius did a lot of that work, and I did some of it as well.\nSo, when you hear the underscoring, it might be 32 bars of Marius and then 16 bars of Karl, and then something that we worked on together. I think the music for this really is a great marriage of what both Marius and I brought to this. And, of course, when you're writing a song, you're sometimes making some tweaks to the lyrics and stuff, so there were a few moments where either Marius or I proposed to the boys that maybe there should be a lyric changed. But by and large, they were the lyricists, I was the songwriter, and Marius and I were both the composer.\nMarius de Vries: What's kind of interesting about the process that I discovered as we got into developing new material for the show is that Josh and Aaron [would] kind of put a phone on the table and sing an acapella version of the song. In many respects, it's actually pretty close to how it turned out, so I think you'd agree, Karl, that it's not a traditional “sitting around the piano” song composition process. It's more of a relay.\nKarl Saint Lucy: Exactly. And they always know how the songs are going to stand [and] they know how they're going to move, so having that information coming into the songwriting process was hugely important.\nHow much were the vocals done on set versus in the studio? Because I would've guessed in the studio and then there was an outtake, I think, of Megan Mullally on the set belting something out.\nMarius de Vries: I'd hesitate to put a percentage on it because I haven't dug through it and worked that out, but a lot of it was recorded live. Most of the twin stuff was live on set. A lot of Megan was live on set, and a fair amount of Nathan was. Megan [Thee Stallion] was lip-synced. I'm a big fan, without getting fetishistic about it, of recording on set, because you get a kind of verisimilitude that is very difficult to achieve with pre-records. I was pleased that, even in an extremely condensed 20-day shoot, we were given the opportunity to slow things down and do what you need to do to get good live takes, and that we were able to use a fair amount of them.\nWere there musicals that you two used as reference, either in songwriting or orchestrating? One of my favorite things about this is how sweet the music sounds paired with these insane lyrics.\nMarius de Vries: I wasn't aware of any specific references. In fact, we were just talking about how we believe that one of the strengths of this is that, in spite of [the fact that] we're going for comedy as much as we can in the songs, there's almost nothing that's to do with parody and referentiality. The songs live on their own. Also, there's a great sincerity to the performance and the composition of the songs that helps support the fact that they're also undermining themselves all the time, referring to themselves, and poking fun at themselves. There’s such a strong emotional core to the songwriting that I think that's what makes the show so involving.\nKarl Saint Lucy: To Marius's point, we were not referential to anything, but if you wanted to talk about shows that I think do some of the things that we do, or have some of the same sensibility, I'm thinking of the Full Monty with the score by David Yazbek. This is a show that's very funny but has some really earnest and emotional moments. I don't know that my work sounds like David Yazbek, but certainly I was drawing from those songs. And Seth McFarlane's work, I think was really in my ear a lot for this as well.\nMarius de Vries: I think if I had a North Star, it would've been the Rocky Horror Show. Not in terms of its content at all, but just in terms of its impact and its sensibility.\nKarl Saint Lucy: And Reefer Madness, the musical, too. It’s funny, I watched Reefer Madness for the first time in a few years the other day, and they also have a scene where oysters and spaghetti are being served at the same time, which I thought was so funny.\nI want to ask about some specific songs because, first off, Megan Thee Stallion's song is so great. I think that's going to be one that people talk about, for sure. Do you know if she was involved with the writing of it at all? Did she have ideas or was she just down to do whatever? \nMarius de Vries: We had to turn that number around insanely fast because Megan was cast at quite a late stage, and the material that we had prepared for that moment was in no way suitable for Megan Thee Stallion to perform. We had to give her something. We knew that she'd bring her own thing to it, but this was barely days before we started shooting, and we only had one day of rehearsal with her and two days on set. We had to take something which was basically kind of a old-fashioned showtune and give it some sort of DNA that she'd be able to connect to.\nWe stopped working on everything else, scrambled together a very quick demo, and with profuse apologies, sent it to her and said, \"This really isn't what you're used to, but see what you can do with this,” and she was a champion. She turned it around in a day, sent us back a more or less finished vocal, came in and rehearsed it. The choreographers had to put it up in about 12 hours. 36 hours later we were shooting it. I'm not sure that we all believed that it was actually going to happen as we were doing that, but the gods were smiling on us. Bowen was smiling on us.\nThe next thing I was going to ask was about “Desperate for your Love”, and just generally just getting Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally to do the things that they do in this. How were they? Did they take any convincing?\nMarius de Vries: Nathan would turn out to work every morning and say, \"This is the greatest mistake of my professional career.\" And it was only last night that he finally admitted that it wasn't.\nKarl Saint Lucy: I told him on set that this movie was going to be his apotheosis.\nMarius de Vries: They were both incredibly game, and I think they knew walking into it that the only way to get through this and make it work was to embrace the extremity. So they knew they had to do that, but it can't have been comfortable for them at times.\nKarl Saint Lucy: It was really interesting to watch the different ways that they approach this. Nathan, very Stanislavski, needs to understand where the character is coming from psychologically. There was this whole thing about [how] he wanted his character to be a famous archeologist, so we gave him a pith helmet, et cetera. And then Megan Mullally… she just plays. It's so fun to watch the fact that they have such a different way of doing this work, but somehow it works together. I think that that's part of the secret sauce that makes them such a special part of this.\nReally quickly about the archeologist [thing] that you mentioned, was that just something he wanted to have in his mind to kind of shape the character? Not in the script, not part of the thing, just for him to have?\nKarl Saint Lucy: Well, he wanted it in the script.\nThat’s great.\nMarius de Vries: The hat. He wanted the hat in the script, specifically. He was given the hat, and he pulled it off. I mean, Megan surprised us; she turned out with that extraordinary accent without really having forewarned us at all. Of course, one of the first things we did was to test singing. There was a lot of very frantic discussion about, \"Oh, this is an unusual turn of events to the character,\" but she'd clearly done an immense amount of wise preparation in building that character. She bought it fairly fully formed, and it worked brilliantly.\nFrom the moment she opened her mouth, I was like, \"How is this going to work in a song?\" And it was incredible. You both are in this movie, I believe, [as well]. How did that come about? Did you ask for it?\nMarius de Vries: One of the things I've started doing at this later stage in my career is insisting on having a cameo in pretty much everything I do, because it keeps things a little bit fresh. So, this is by no means my first small role in a big musical, but I don't know how to explain it other than I kept pestering Larry, saying, \"You've got to put me in somewhere.\" Then a scene came up and they were short of a maître d’, and I got a call at five-thirty saying, \"Can you be on set at seven-thirty?\" and so there I was. But I think Karl has a much more significant and important visual role in the film than I do, so perhaps the question is better addressed to him.\nKarl Saint Lucy: It was a lot of fun. I got to be the martini shot that day, so we spent the whole day throwing spaghetti around the set, and then watching the prop cleaners put the spaghetti back on the plate and throw it around again. The whole place just smelled awful, you know, with the lights and everything. It was, like, the last 20 minutes of shooting for that day. Larry was just shouting direction at me, and it was so much fun. Then, afterwards, he came up to me and he was like, \"Was that okay? Are you all right?\" and I was like, \"Oh my God, please shout at me as much as you want.\" It was incredibly fun. I know they wanted to originally put me in a tux, and I'm so glad that they let me wear a kaftan instead.\nWas there anything that didn't make it into the movie that was too much?\nKarl Saint Lucy: In Megan's song, there used to be a moment where she was playing a fish harmonica and air drums, and we worked very hard to work the fish harmonica into the song, and that did not make it, sadly.\nMarius de Vries: Yeah, Megan had a drum solo. I kind of miss that. One day the world will see it. That’s when the movie went from being an 88-minute movie to an 87-minute movie.\nI feel there is a theremin at one point in the score. Did I make that up?\nKarl Saint Lucy: It’s an ondes Martenot, which is similar to a theremin, but it's a keyboard instrument that was very, like Messiaen used it a lot in his Turangalîla-Symphonie. We got the VST (virtual instrument). Originally, the p**sy was supposed to be horrific, so we had this huge cue that was a reference to Jerry Goldsmith's Alien where the ondes Martenot had a really prominent role, but we ended up having to cut that when the p**sy ended up being very cute.\nSo that instrument came in as a thematic instrument for that?\nKarl Saint Lucy: For the p**sy, yeah.\nMarius de Vries: That was the p**sy instrument. And then the ondes Martenot, apart from Messiaen, the most recent expert or virtuoso on the ondes Martenot is Johnny Greenwood who used-\nDo you two each have favorite songs that you were able to work on for this?\nMarius de Vries: I think, for me, the real standout is “Lonely”.\nKarl Saint Lucy: Yeah, me too.\nMarius de Vries: It's kind of the most extreme example of the way that the sincerity and the songwriting is juxtaposed with the ludicrousness of the situation, and I think it pushes that device about as far as it can go.\nKarl Saint Lucy: And I was kind of lifted out of being alone in my apartment through the pandemic to do this, and I think a lot of people on set were sort of feeling lonely. On the day that we got to see that shot, I mean, Megan Mullally's performance was--we were all just weeping. For me, that felt like a real coup. Not only were we getting everyone on set to laugh and sing the songs, but we were also getting them to cry because of, like you said, the sincerity of her performance in that. And Nathan's.\nMarius de Vries: When we did our first set of piano demos just after the pandemic--just at the beginning of pre-production--and sent them to Larry, first of all, amazingly, he liked them all, so we were off to a strong start. I put the “Lonely” song, and he said, \"I immediately wept. Then, I went outside for a walk, and I came back and played it again, and I wept again.\" So we knew that we had a tear jerker on our hands.\nSomething that I loved so much about this is [that] I felt like there were takes where the actors were just laughing at the end of the take, [that were] left in the movie. To me, it just speaks to this thing where this movie's insane, and it's so raunchy, but it's so sweet and has so much heart at the same time. To me, I think that's why it works so well. Is that something that you all talked about, had discussions about, and made an effort to preserve as you were putting this together?\nMarius de Vries: I think there's something about the fact that it was lifted conceptually from that initial 30-minute rowdy comedic stage show and [us] wanting to keep a sense of liveness about it and a sense of theatricality to it across all departments. That breaking phenomenon that you're talking about, I think, is to do with that. And you're right, I think it pulls you into the joint endeavor of just having a wonderful time and enjoying the humor together that is part of the inclusiveness of it. I don't know, Karl, you can probably speak to that better than I can.\nKarl Saint Lucy: I also just want to say that Nathan Lane is also really largely responsible for that, because as we were in development, he kept reminding us, \"Yes, let's go for the jokes, but let's also go for the heart. There has to be a heart to this.\" I think that that already existed in the show, but it was incredibly helpful to have Nathan reminding us of that periodically throughout the process.\nTwo self-obsessed businessmen (writers Aaron Jackson & Josh Sharp) discover they’re long-lost identical twins and come together to plot the reunion of their eccentric divorced parents, in this riotously funny and depraved musical from comedy icon Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Borat) also starring Megan Thee Stallion, Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Bowen Yang as God.\nCheck out our other interviews here:\nDicks: The Musical arrives in select theaters on October 6 before its nationwide release on October 20.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "Halloween: Where Is Haddonfield? Filming & Movie Location", "date": "2023-10-02 21:50:27", "text": "Halloween's Haddonfield, Illinois isn't a real place but rather a creative mix of several locations that create the haunting setting for the film.\nOne of the scariest aspects of John Carpenter’s Halloween is the suggestion that the film's horrific events could happen in any typical American suburban town. In the 1978 horror classic, that town is the fictional Haddonfield, Illinois located in Livingston County. While some may make the assumption that Haddonfield is a real town, the film's crew members creatively blended several locations together to create the vision that Carpenter had in mind for his ideal horror setting.\nHaddonfield, Illinois is the perfect backdrop for Michael Myers and his silent reign of terror, being a picturesque and presumably safe autumnal town. Large Victorian homes line the streets along with impressive lawns and plenty of trees, making it an ideal Midwestern town before Michael shows up. Halloween was so effective because it introduced intense threats and elements of fear in an idyllic location. Finding such a perfect town to shoot in might have been difficult if it weren't for the fact that Haddonfield, as Halloween fans know it, isn't a real place.\nRELATED: Halloween’s Franchise Future Is Promising, But It Will Only Work With Michael Myers\nHaddonfield, Illinois may not be real, but it is based on a real town named Haddonfield. The actual Haddonfield is in southern New Jersey, not too far from Philadelphia. Debra Hill, who co-wrote and produced Halloween with John Carpenter, was from Haddonfield which inspired the town's name in the movie. Because of this detail, there has been a common misconception that Halloween was shot in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Interestingly, the towns do look quite similar considering both have plenty of trees and large single-family homes, including some in a similar Victorian style.\nThe actual filming locations for Halloween were entirely shot in Los Angeles, California, and South Pasadena. Shooting for Halloween was done over the course of 20 days mostly in South Pasadena, California with some additional filming in Alhambra, Sierra Madre, and Hollywood in May 1978. Considering that Halloween is supposed to take place in the fall, set designers had difficulties filming in California in the spring. The crew used artificial leaves to cover the ground and were forced to work around consistent sun exposure by finding rare wooded areas. Viewers who pay close attention will notice palm trees in the background of shots at certain points of the movie.\nRELATED: Halloween Can Finally Return To John Carpenter’s Original Franchise Plan After 40 Years & 5 Reboots\nThe real house of Michael Myers used in Halloween is located at 1000 Mission Street, South Pasadena, California, USA. The house is still standing today and is privately owned by a massage therapist, meaning that it does not operate as a tourist attraction for Halloween fans. The house resides next to a railroad and is only accessible by one main road. It does not have any other filming credits to its name. There is a fictional replica of Michael Myers' house that is located in North Carolina where fans can visit and take pictures without entering the property. While Haddonfield may not be a real place, Halloween successfully created the perfect small town for a new horror franchise to be born that continues to this day.\n"}
{"title": "Sister Wives: Christine Left LuLaRoe (8 Ways The Company's &quot;Culty&quot;)", "date": "2023-10-02 21:48:19", "text": "Sister Wives star Christine Brown's been linked with LuLaRoe, but she's actually cut ties with the firm. Was the clothing business too \"culty\"? \nSister Wives star Christine Brown isn't affiliated with LuLaRoe anymore, and since the searing documentary LuLaRich aired, she may be trying to distance herself from the company. In season 18, Christine's reinventing herself. She left Kody Brown, and seems quite happy to be free of him. However, she does resent him at times, especially when he mistreats her close friend Janelle Brown. Christine's so over polygamy with reality show star Kody. However, embracing life without the patriarch isn't the only change that she's making. In love and business, she's evolving.\nSister Wives season 18's featured some memorable drama so far, but Janelle's issues with Kody probably deliver the most riveting onscreen entertainment. Janelle and Kody are having serious problems, and although she thinks he's \"hot,\" she wants to go to couples' counseling with him. Janelle doesn't see another way out of their problems, and she's really losing hope. Christine's focusing on the future, but she's willing to be friends with Kody. He thinks she's playing some kind of game, but more often than not, Christine's 100 percent sincere. A straight shooter, Christine values directness in others. She's all about emotional honesty. She may consider LuLaRoe a little too shady.\nRelated: Did Christine From Sister Wives Get Engaged Too Fast? (Will David Woolley Let Her Down Like Kody Did?)\nIn LuLaRich, people who tried to sell the company's leggings and other products were often disappointed by the quality of the merchandise that they received. Some got stinky leggings because the fabric was moldy and rotting. It's not uncommon for people to sink a lot of their savings into building LuLaRoe ventures. There's a cult mentality that gets recruits excited about being a part of the organization. This may drive overspending. Said recruits sell the products from home, and when quality is poor, they're much more likely to lose money.\nChristine's an honorable person who may not want to risk linking her name with the company anymore. She's got a new man, David Woolley, and doesn't seem to be strapped for cash. Her place in Utah, which was shown in season 18, looks very nice. Janelle's the one who's having money issues. Christine's engaged, and that means that she's probably sharing expenses with David. That may be another reason why she chose to stop promoting LuLaRoe.\nLuLaRich showed the dark side of a seemingly sunny company. This firm appears to primarily target women, promising them income, clout and perks. However, those who want to sell LuLaRoe need to spend money in order to get started. That's the first red flag. When people need to buy the products that they sell, it's often the hallmark of an MLM scheme.\nMulti-level marketing (MLM) is about drawing people in at the bottom of the pyramid. The money that people at the bottom spend helps to line the pockets of the people on top. Without bringing in more people at the bottom, the system falls apart. So, basically, with a pyramid scheme, money's made by recruiting new salespeople who buy products. That's often much more important to CEOs than sales to end users i.e. the people who buy (and wear) the bold and colorful leggings.\nIn other words, the money that the salespeople spend is what makes the company's owners so rich. Anyone who wants to thrive in an MLM needs to aggressively recruit. There can be a brainwashing mindset in pyramid scheme companies. Quite often, LuLaRoe salespeople, such as Meri Brown, are encouraged to pester friends, family and others in order to bring them aboard. Lives have been ruined by MLM companies. People buy into the dream and end up in debt, with their hopes dashed.\nIn LuLaRich, many wrenching stories were captured on film. While some people had positive experiences, those who ended up with nothing were stressed and heartbroken. They fell hook, line and sinker for the marketing patter that LuLaRoe owners Mark and DeAnne Stidham deliver, and deeply regret being so naive. Some have homes filled with unsold merchandise, including defective products that no one is likely to buy.\nSince the company gets such bad press now, it's not that surprising that Christine stopped promoting it. It's actually a pretty smart decision. It's a choice that's easy to respect.\nPart of the whole cult mentality's selling a dream. Cult leaders know how to dazzle their \"marks.\" They promise whatever the person doesn't have. In a typical cult, a vulnerable person who feels lonely will be made to feel like an integral part of a group. However, there's always a price to be paid down the line. For example, the cult member might be asked to do unpaid labor (as in Scientology's Sea Org) or cut off any friends and family members who criticize the cult. A cult member might also be asked to give money to the organization.\nWhile LuLaRoe isn't a bona fide cult, it has a lot in common with a true cult. People who want to be rich are drawn in by glitzy success stories from members. As well, the company puts on events where the dream is intensively sold to the team. For example, the Puerto Vallarta get-together shown above sends the message that life as a LuLaRoe representative means fun in the sun, freedom from financial worries, and good times with coworkers.\nIf a person buys enough products and sells them, they might be included at this type of VIP event. Then, they can live the dream. Of course, few make the cut. Those who never scale those heights may find that they've blown thousands (or even tens of thousands) of dollars on products and never really turned a profit. For every LuLaRoe success story like Meri's, there are many \"fails\" that don't get publicized. That's why the Washington State Attorney General sued LuLaRoe. The company had to pay 4.75 million USD in damages, as per Yahoo.\nAbove, a happy model extols the virtues of \"twirl-worthy moments,\" as per LuLaRoe at Instagram. The woman wearing the ruffled LuLaRoe frock seems confident and serene. She's there to make other women want what she has. While LuLaRoe representatives may really get that \"twirl-worthy\" feeling at first, it's just too good to last. The joy linked with joining the company is often fleeting.\nIn the life cycle of a cult, members start out strong, fully believing in the reality that's shoved down their throats. However, as time passes, many cult members get cynical. They notice abuses that make them question the lives they've chosen. Disillusionment's quite common, and people who escape from cults often feel traumatized. Some never move past their pain.\nWith LuLaRoe, there's also been disillusionment. For example, when representatives tried to return defective leggings and the like, they were given a hard time, and many were stuck with the flawed merchandise. They weren't taken care of. A cult chews up and spits out members, and it seems like LuLaRoe's done the very same.\nShould Meri be ashamed of pushing LuLaRoe designs on her Instagram followers? Maybe. While she seems to be having a positive experience with the company, she must be smart enough to know that famous and influential LuLaRose reps get VIP treatment. To create a comparison, Tom Cruise is going to enjoy life as a Scientologist more than the average Joe will. Tom will be treated with kid gloves, but other members may be treated like slaves.\nWhen Meri promotes such as a culty company, that's actually been legally penalized for its business practices, she may be sucking in women (and men too) who won't get special treatment. They may pour their savings down the drain in order to try and live Meri's reality. Christine left the company, and Meri's still a part of it. Meri loves the conferences and everything else that LuLaRoe provides. However, she may be willfully ignoring some painful truths about the firm.\nMeri and Christine promoted LuLaRoe, and, as previously mentioned, Meri's still doing it. In their promotional posts, they made the company look like the answer to their prayers. When people see LuLaRoe reps succeeding so wildly, and fail the get the same results, they may feel very bad about themselves. Of course, a reality TV show star has a much higher chance of making money in an MLM company. Fame is currency that can be leveraged to get the most from new business opportunities.\nMeri isn't a typical LuLaRoe member. Thanks to appearing in 18 Sister Wives seasons, she's very famous. Her online platform is massive, and that means that she has a pool of potential LuLaRoe recruits at her fingertips. The average person who's starting out with the company won't have any of that. In a sense, this company sells the stories of its stars, and sets recruits up to fail. Without success in an MLM, a person is basically nobody. Everything revolves around money and the status that selling brings. When someone fails, they may feel excommunicated.\nPromising the moon and then failing to honor return policies is bad business and shady. It's the type of gaslighting that leads to court cases and other negative outcomes. Good companies will accept returns of defective products. Sketchy firms will make it almost impossible for people to get their money back. Phones will go unanswered. Messages left on social media will be ignored and/or deleted. Bad companies do this stuff all the time.\nIn a cult, a leader will also gaslight underlings, making them believe that they're the problem. A leader retains power by inspiring, or by instilling fear and doubt. It's typically one or the other. A good leader will care about underlings, while a bad one won't value them, except as a means to an end.\nChristine knows all about bad leadership. She experienced it with Kody. The uber-patriarch didn't do much to steer the Brown family forward. He favored Robyn and neglected the other wives. When they complained, he twisted things around to make them feel like villains. It could be argued that a plural marriage can be a sort of micro-cult. A leader calls the shots and wives obey. If they don't, they may be punished. At the least, they'll learn what gaslighting really means.\nDevotees like Meri probably don't get fleeced because they add so much value, but a typical LuLaRoe initiate will be strongly encouraged to spend, spend, spend...perhaps, until it hurts. Cults are known for fleecing followers. Some cult leaders live like royalty while their underlings have very little. There's always a huge chasm between the highly successful VIPS and those at the bottom.\nA worthy organization is not going to have this dynamic. There will be more fairness, and those who need help will get it, rather than being ignored. There's no such thing as a good cult, and there may be no such thing as a good MLM either. When Meri promotes the LuLaRoe \"good life,\" she's probably not helping her followers. They might end up wasting a lot of money trying to grab brass rings. Since Christine's finished with the company, she can focus on promoting more positive things. However, Christine's link with Plexus dietary supplements is also controversial.\nInfluencers often push shady products, such as diet teas and \"pink drinks.\" They do it for money. As long as their followers perform research, to find out the truth about what their favorite stars are promoting, they should make smart choices. If they don't, they may end up feeling ripped off.\nIn Sister Wives season 18, Christine's spreading her wings and leaving the past behind. She left LuLaRoe behind too. By sealing herself off from the bad vibes that Kody and the clothing company bring, she's doing what's best for herself. Now, she can focus on things that make her happy.\nSources: Yahoo, LuLaRoeInstagram\n"}
{"title": "Malfoy's Missed Redemption: How Draco's Deleted Deathly Hallows Scene Would Have Ruined Harry Potter's Twist Ending", "date": "2023-10-02 21:30:28", "text": "A Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 deleted scene would have given Draco Malfoy a redemption but also could have ruined the plot.\nA deleted scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have redeemed Draco Malfoy, but it might have ruined Harry's twist ending in the process. The Slytherin student was Harry's Hogwarts rival for most of the Harry Potter series, but after joining Lord Voldemort, Draco discovered that he didn't enjoy Darkness as much as he had thought. Still, the character never truly got a redemption, instead choosing to be passive in the Second Wizarding War. The Harry Potter movies attempted to remedy this by adding a heroic scene for Draco Malfoy, but it was ultimately removed from Deathly Hallows Part 2's final cut.\nAt the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, what everyone presumed was Harry Potter's body was carried by Hagrid to the Hogwarts courtyard. Voldemort hoped that the Boy Who Lived's death would squash the resistance at the Castle, but he was wrong. Of course, Harry was actually still alive. In a deleted scene from this sequence, Draco Malfoy sees Harry get to his feet and rushes across the courtyard to toss him his wand. This scene never made it into the film, a fact that Draco fans have lamented for years.\nRELATED: Harry Potter Cast - Where Are They Now?\nDraco Malfoy was far from a true villain in Harry Potter, but he certainly had some rough moments. Deeply prejudiced against Muggle-borns, he established himself as a not-so-pleasant person the moment that Harry Potter met him. However, things changed for the character in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Voldemort had made him a Death Eater to punish his father, Lucius Malfoy, and gave him the seemingly impossible task of murdering Albus Dumbledore. The pressure of this began to tear Draco apart.\nThough he wasn't nearly as nasty after this in Harry Potter, and Harry even mentioned in the books that he felt a good deal of pity for his old rival, Draco never had a moment in which he took any sort of stand against Voldemort. Instead, he passively shrunk into the corner and waited for the horror to end. The deleted scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have definitively answered whose side Draco was on and would have proven that he had it in him to be a hero. Of course, such a thing never happened in the books either, and it was for an excellent reason.\nWhen he entered the Forbidden Forest in Deathly Hallows, Harry already had Draco's wand. In fact, this was a key detail of this impactful moment. Though Draco hadn't known it, he had been the master of the Elder Wand since the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, when he disarmed Albus Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Though it wasn't the Elder Wand itself, Draco's wand became a sort of symbol of the wand's ownership. Therefore, when Harry wrenched it from Draco's hand at Malfoy Manor, the Elder Wand shifted its loyalty to Harry.\nThis moment at Malfoy Manor was included in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, so it's unclear how the deleted scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have explained why Draco suddenly had the wand again at the Battle of Hogwarts. Even with some justification, though, this would have presented a significant problem. Wand loyalty doesn't transfer when a witch or wizard willingly gives their wand to another individual—there are countless times in Harry Potter that a borrowed wand was noted to not work properly for the borrower. Therefore, if Draco had given Harry his wand, Harry wouldn't have become master of the Elder Wand and would have lost his battle against Voldemort.\nAs previously mentioned, the deleted scene in Deathly Hallows may have come with some justification for how Draco got his wand back. Of course, he couldn't have forcefully acquired it from Harry because then the Elder Wand's loyalty would have shifted back to Draco. However, if Harry had somehow dropped the wand at the Battle of Hogwarts, and Draco picked it up, returning it to Harry in a big moment of bravery and redemption might not have messed with the Elder Wand's loyalty. Still, this would have been pretty muddy ground for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to wade through.\nWand loyalty may have been the key to Harry Potter's ending, but many questions remain unanswered about how it works. For example, even dropping a wand could be grounds for lost loyalty. Still, if Harry had dropped Draco's wand, would that have affected the Elder Wand - or would he have had to drop the Death Stick itself? It's all a little too complicated, which is likely why Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 deleted this scene to begin with. Ultimately, Draco was better off with an ambiguous redemption, no matter how great it would have been to see him join Harry's side.\n"}
{"title": "Nightwing & Superboy as Pokémon Trainers Proves DC NEEDS to Organize a Crossover", "date": "2023-10-02 21:30:28", "text": "In recent years, DC Comics has shown incredible creative foresight in its crossover content, but a Pokémon crossover would be a great opportunity.\nDespite DC Comics' willingness to take on crossovers and teams-ups with non-traditional partners or explore putting its heroes in situations outside the primary canonic DC universe, new fanart exposes its need to collaborate with Pokémon, one of the most popular and widely known franchises on Earth.\nNow the worlds of DC Comics and Pokémon have been brought together in works of fanart by the artist malenjoyer. In a pair of posts on Instagram, malenjoyer imagines Dick Grayson's Nightwing and Conner Kent's Superboy as Pokémon trainers with their Pokémon ready for battle.\nWhile malenjoyer's art is fascinating in and of itself, an equally interesting element to the illustrations is the suggestions it makes for DC - Pokémon crossover. Judging by the feedback both illustrations have gotten so far, it's a crossover event that would be quite popular with the fans.\nThe need for a DC Comics/Pokémon crossover is made all the stronger when considering the publisher's impressive recent history of non-traditional collaborations. \"Non-traditional\" in this context refers to crossovers that are not just between superheroes, but can include a range of content. Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce's upcoming Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong miniseries is a perfect illustration of the creative crossovers DC has been willing to explore. Indeed, this series is not your grandfather's crossover. As the title suggests, the story involves the DC's Justice League taking on Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse royalty. It's not the kind of crossover one would expect from a comic book publisher, but it is one that makes sense from a thematic and entertainment perspective.\nDC Comics has also found success in expanding the horizons of its superhero line-up by putting them in alternate reality situations that do not normally include heroes. Daniel Warren Johnson and Juan Gedeon's The Jurassic League limited series is emblematic of how DC has been successfully experimenting with this material in recent years. The story reimagines the Justice League as composed of a group of super-powered dinosaurs who resemble Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Similarly, their enemies - like the Joker - are also super-powered dinosaurs with human characteristics.\nThere are other series that demonstrate that further express DC's creative willingness to take on next-gen crossovers, collaborations, and alternate universe stories. For example, there's James Tynion IV and Matthew Rosenberg's DC vs. Vampires, which see DC heroes confront a plague of vampires. There's also Kenny Porter and Baldemar Rivas' DC Mech, which has heroes suiting up in giant mechanical robots to fight their battles. Incidentally, DC Mech draws from the same rich world of anime and manga that Pokémon is from.\nAll this content reinforces the idea that DC needs to establish a crossover with Pokémon. As malenjoyer shows in his art, tabbing a Pokémon to a specific DC hero has the potential to create a landmark crossover. First, there's Pokemon's current global popularity. Matching it with an equally popular DC hero or villain is a recipe for success. Who wouldn't want to see a Batman versus Joker Pokémon battle? Second, there's the ease of two-world integration. In Pokémon, anyone can be a Pokémon trainer or owner. So, it wouldn't be strange for a hero to also be one too. Third, it's a collaboration that offers an extremely broad range of story options. There are no limits to the stories that can be generated from a collaboration. All things taken into consideration, a DC Comics - Pokémon crossover seems like a match made in collaboration heaven. This leaves fans to wonder why one has not occurred yet and demand that one NEEDS to occur soon.\nSource: malenjoyer via Instagram (1, 2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "How Many People Actually Died In Pompeii", "date": "2023-10-02 21:21:26", "text": "Because Pompeii focuses on individual characters more than the community, the movie may leave viewers wondering about the real event’s death count.\nAfter watching Pompeii, viewers may be left wondering how many people died in the real-life tragedy the film is based on. The action romance movie tells the story of a Celtic gladiator named Milo who falls in love with a woman named Cassia and escapes slavery. Pompeii's story unravels in the days leading up to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. By the end of the movie, all the main characters have perished.\nThough scientists praised the movie for its relatively realistic depiction of the volcanic eruption and the city, Pompeii's true story had a vastly different aftermath. Mount Vesuvius impacted a wider area than what's shown on-screen, and the death toll looked quite different. Numerous people died due to the eruption, which included multiple waves. However, some escaped the impact and went on to live elsewhere.\nRELATED: 5 Best (& 5 Worst) Movies About Volcanoes\nPompeii doesn't specifically reveal how many people died in the tragedy, taking a narrative approach instead. In real life, approximately 2,000 people died in Pompeii due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Unfortunately, the death toll included many more individuals than those located in Pompeii. The number is much higher when counting the deaths of people in Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, Torre Annunziata, and other villages in the region (via Britannica). In total, History estimates that the number could be as high as 16,000 casualties.\nThe movie Pompeii opens with a quote from a letter in late 107 A.D. — not 79 A.D., the year of the eruption — written by Pliny the Younger, a Roman lawyer and author, to a historian named Tacitus. Combining his words and the images of the \"Two Maidens\" of Pompeii, the opening helps frame the events of the movie. The quote reads:\n\"In the darkness, you could hear the crying of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men. Some prayed for help. Others wished for death. But, still, more imagined that there were no Gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness.\"\nConsidering Pliny the Younger witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius firsthand and survived to write about the event in letters, viewers can surmise that people survived the events of Pompeii. However, the movie doesn't actually depict any survivors. Instead, Milo and Cassia end up dying due to the fireballs and pyroclastic flow, even though they attempt to leave the city.\nRELATED: 10 Best Disaster Movies Ever, Ranked\nDespite the Pompeii movie's portrayal of events, volcanologist Claudio Scarpati and his colleagues found that 73% to 92% of citizens successfully escaped the town during the initial signs of Mount Vesuvius' eruption. It's unknown exactly how many of that percentage survived in the long run because people outside the walls of Pompeii, especially those in the nearby city of Herculaneum, died due to the second wave of pyroclastic flow (via NBC News). It's heavily debated by scholars how many people escaped the tragic aftermath of the eruption. Ultimately, despite what the movie Pompeii implies, it's approximated that several thousands of individuals lived.\nSources: Britannica, History, NBC News\nDani Kessel Odom (they/them) works as a Core Features Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "Why Daryl Dixon & Codron Can't Be Friends According To Walking Dead Star", "date": "2023-10-02 21:19:29", "text": "The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon star Romain Levi explains why Daryl and his character, Codron, can't be friends after what Daryl did to his brother.\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4! \nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon star Romain Levi has opened up about why his character, Codron, can never be friends with Daryl. In episode 1 of the spinoff series, Daryl kills Codron's brother, resulting in the Pouvoir Guerrier pursuing Daryl for revenge. The pair have fought twice so far, with Daryl gaining the upper hand or escaping Codron's grasp each time.\nSpeaking with Collider, Levi explained that, because Daryl killed Codron's brother, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon likely won't feature the pair becoming allies. He described how difficult it would be for Codron to forgive Daryl because his brother was such a major part of who he was. Check out what Levi had to say below:\nWhat happened between Daryl and his brother, it’s not easy for Codron to forgive or be respectful. In a way, to forgive someone is to accept what happened, and Codron doesn’t accept the situation. His brother was a part of himself, really, and Codron will never be the same after that. His brother was the only human being that he was very close to. And what would his brother think, if Codron were friends with Daryl? I’m not sure he’d be so happy about that. So, I won’t say yes he can or no he can’t because it’s not so easy in this situation.\nCodron's path of revenge against Daryl has only grown stronger as the Walking Dead series has progressed. This includes Codron going directly to the leader of the Pouvoir, Genet, to get a group of soldiers to help him in his quest to kill Daryl. His vengeance is fed into by Genet, who wants Daryl dead for destroying important research aboard one of the Pouvoir's ships before the start of the series.\nCodron's new faction in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon wants Daryl dead just as much as he does. This means that, even if his allegiances were to change, he is still under orders to kill Daryl. He may also be tasked with killing Laurent, since Genet wants the boy dead for the optimism he brings the Union of Hope. If he were to succeed, this would further drive a wedge between him and Daryl.\nHowever, Genet's plan to kill Laurent could also be what makes Codron decide to stop hunting Daryl. The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon trailer teases Codron will hold Laurent at gunpoint, but it's unclear if he will kill the boy. Perhaps Codron will realize the monster he would become by killing a child, deciding to stop seeking revenge against Daryl not for himself, but for Laurent. However, with Daryl and Laurent escaping Paris in episode 4, anything could happen as season 1 reaches its apex.\nSource: Collider\n"}

The series follows an alternate reality in which the Soviet Union landed on the moon before the United States and the space race never ended. Each season has taken a time jump that delves further into what a continued competition between the world's superpowers would look like if they kept striving for the stars.\nAhead of the release of For All Mankind season 4, Hadfield breaks down a scene for Vanity Fair where he is shown a scene in which an American astronaut shoots a Soviet astronaut on the moon.\nHe discussed how gunfire on the moon is much more accurate as opposed to on Earth, citing the lack of air and oxygen, thus making the bullet shoot straighter and farther. Along with confirming the accuracy of the gunfire in the scene, he went on to explain how the impact of a bullet on a space suit was also true to life:\nIt's a hundred percent oxygen inside a spacesuit, so everything burns. We have had a fire inside a spacewalking suit. It was in test at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and even the aluminum was burning inside the suit. Fortunately, there was not a person in the suit. You don't want any sparks to be even possible inside a hundred percent oxygen environment.\nWhile earlier in his review of For All Mankind Hadfield bashed it as \"excruciating to watch\", he was impressed with the shooting scene. Hadfield had previously researched how guns would fire on the moon for his fiction thriller, The Apollo Murders. His praise comes not only from the point of view of an astronaut, but also as a storyteller. And compared to the accuracy of movies like Moonfall, For All Mankind has a lot going for it.\nDespite calling some of For All Mankind \"cartoonish\" after only a few episodes, the narrative of the show does at times supersede realistic science. This isn't the only film in which Hadfield pointed out inconsistencies. Notably, he commended on Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 for the scene that shows Star-Lord floating through space unprotected. Hadfield chalked this up to a viewer's experience, stating that it would have been done to more entice audiences. Another interesting scenario that Hadfield felt would be accurate if it ever occurred was the concept of someone born in space as shown in The Expanse.\nWhile For All Mankind may not hold up in all aspects, the show has taken an interesting premise and still clearly puts forth an effort in the topics it handles. Hadfield's critiques do make the show more interesting, especially when he points out the parts that line up with scientific accuracy.\nSource: Vanity Fair\n"}
{"title": "Can 200+ Improvements Fix Payday 3's Disaster Of A Launch?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "Payday 3's launch has been one of the worst of 2023, but developer Starbreeze Studios has revealed its plans to fix the cooperative shooter.\nPayday 3 was finally released on all current-gen consoles and PC - and was included as part of the main Xbox, PC, and Ultimate Game Pass tiers - on September 21, 2023. The title was highly anticipated by fans of the heist shooter series who had waited just over a decade since the release of its predecessor, Payday 2, but unfortunately, it has suffered from one of the worst launches of the year so far. Developer Starbreeze Studios seems intent on turning things around, though, promising over 200 improvements are on the way.\nPayday 3 picks up many years after the Payday Gang's crime spree in Washington DC in 2013's Payday 2. The group appeared to have retired after this, but were forced back into action to deal with a threat in New York, and much like the previous titles before it, Payday 3 would see players engaging in a variety of heists both in single-player with AI teammates or in online co-op with a team of up to three other players.\nRelated: \"Smart, Fun, And Chaotic In Every Way\" - Payday 3 Review\nDespite having a single-player option, the Payday games are primarily designed for online cooperative play. Therefore, the fact that the game's matchmaking was completely broken at launch was a major issue. Another issue was that the game - as is a growing trend in the industry these days - required players to be constantly online regardless of whether they were playing solo or with others.\nPayday 3 also suffered from frequent server crashes, which has left a huge number of players unable to play the game completely. As a result, those who bought the game on Steam reviewed the game en masse to vent their frustrations with it currently sitting at an overall Mostly Negative score, and positioned within the top 50 worst-rated games on the platform, with one Steam user dubbing it \"Payday 3: Main Menu Simulator\"​​​​.\nRelated: \"I Think I Would Be A Horrible Bank Robber\" - Payday 3's Lead Producer Interview\nOn September 25, Almir Listo, global brand director for Payday 3's developers, Starbreeze Studios, addressed the need for the game to always be online when responding to a comment on a Twitch stream on the official PAYDAY The Game channel. Regarding an offline mode, Listo said, “We cannot give, right now, a clear yes or no answer on this topic because it’s four days since launch. We did not foresee the incredible difficulties you had logging into the game. And we will address that, and answer that properly, as soon as we can.”\nStarbreeze Entertainment has since announced a plan for fixing the title on its official website. The plan consists of over 200 quality-of-life improvements coming this month, with an unspecified number of further improvements, bug fixes, new content, and functionality coming at later dates throughout the Fall before the Syntax Error DLC launches in Winter.\nThe update also addressed the game's matchmaking issues, stating that fixes had been made on September 26 and September 29 and that Payday 3 is \"stable\" and has had \"good performance\" after the completed maintenance. Starbreeze Entertainment's CEO Tobias Sjögren went on to thank the community for its patience with a launch that was \"not the start [Starbreeze] wanted\" and explained that the studio's business model is \"a marathon and not a sprint\", which indicates even further, regular updates and enhancements to the game to support Payday 3's live-service roadmap.\nWhen it actually works, Payday 3 can be a solid title that more than holds up to the standards of its predecessors, so hopefully these fixes will be enough to save it. For example, titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 have had disastrous launches but have been redeemed by a number of updates since. However, in a time when there are so many other titles on offer, with October alone being full of new major releases, publishers are running more of a risk of killing their games at launch by forcing studios to release them in broken or unfinished states, especially if they're dependent on fans coming back regularly for live-service content like Payday 3.\nSources: Steam, PAYDAYTheGame/Twitch, Starbreeze Entertainment\n"}

With only nine episodes per season, each with a short runtime, there is plenty of room for Star Wars: Visions to continue telling new stories. The variety on display from each animation studio offers a refreshing perspective on the franchise in an era where many Star Wars TV shows feel the same.\nAlthough Star Wars: Visions is considered non-canon, the show may influence the main Star Wars timeline, just as the old Expanded Universe continues to influence the current canon. Many Star Wars: Visions episodes were set in a different timeline, especially in season 1, but many episodes from season 2 seemed as though they could fit in the canon timeline. With so much creativity and potential to impact the larger franchise, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about a potential Star Wars: Visions season 3.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nWhile the release of Star Wars: Visions season 3 is highly probable, Lucasfilm has not officially confirmed it. This is understandable since Star Wars: Visions season 2 came out in May 2023, and there are plenty of other shows to keep fans busy and upcoming Star Wars movies to get audiences excited. It will likely be some time before Lucasfilm needs to announce any details about Star Wars: Visions season 3.\nThe popularity of Star Wars: Visions season 1 and 2 is the most significant reason for season 3 to happen. As a massive multimedia franchise, Star Wars can sometimes feel repetitive and hard to keep up with, but Star Wars: Visions focuses on unique standalone stories. Each studio has complete freedom to use a different animation style and experiment with how to tell a Star Wars story.\nBased on past release dates, Star Wars: Visions season will probably be released on May 4, 2023. Season 1 dropped in September 2021, but season 2 came out on Star Wars Day in 2023, a much more effective release date. Star Wars: Visions season 3 may be a long way out, but Star Wars fans have plenty of content to look forward to in the meantime, and it will surely be worth the wait.\n"}

Iconic heroes like Storm and Captain America are joined by rising stars such as White Widow and Spider-Boy for this series of snowy portraits. Fashion-inspired variant covers are not new to Marvel Comics, which has made waves with its haute couture-infused Hellfire Gala covers for the past three years. Of course, no one necessarily needs a special occasion to be fashionable, and this surprise showcase of winter apparel is a welcome treat.\nMarvel recently announced the series alongside a preview of five out of the total seven ski chalet variants.\nLucas Werneck's variant for Thunderbolts #1 and Russel Dauterman's cover for X-Men #29 debut on December 6. The following week, Greg Land's contribution for Captain America #4 arrives. The next three covers all hit the shelves on December 20, featuring J. Scott Campbell on Amazing Spider-Man #40, Pablo Villalobos for Doctor Strange #10, and Humberto Ramos' variant for Spider-Boy #2. David Nakayama concludes the festivities on December 27 with a cover for Spider-Woman #2.\nNakayama and Campbell's covers have not been revealed yet, but Marvel's announcement still provides the five other variants. The result is a veritable feast for the eyes. Werneck brings a signature level of beauty and grace to his action shot of the White Widow Yelena Belova. Land, often critiqued for the use of tracing in his comic work, delivers a pleasant surprise with his fresh rendition of Steve Rogers in a retro ski suit. However, Dauterman's Storm is perhaps the most notable of the series thus far, as the snow-robed Wind-Rider is transcendent. Ororo Munroe has proven quite the muse for Dauterman, as he designed Storm's current costume and has brought the consistent rendering of her natural hair texture into the mainstream at Marvel.\nWhile Marvel has certainly been working more fashion-inspired concepts into its variants in recent years, this trend is nothing new. Just as many of Marvel's writers in the '70s were authors who could only find consistent work in comics, numerous artists in the same era were fashion illustrators taking on side gigs in comic work. This trained eye for design is why so many iconic character looks and costumes have endured from that era until today. Arguably though, the zenith of the fashion industry's influence on Marvel Comics was the annual Marvel Swimsuit Special that ran from 1991 to 1995. What's old is new, and Marvel is certainly feeling fashion fever once again.\nOnly two covers have yet to reveal their take on heroic hilltop apparel. However, winter extends beyond December, and if this initial set of ski chalet variants is met with success, it's more than likely next year will bring even more Marvel icons to the slopes. Either way, there's plenty to enjoy with this series of variant covers as some of Marvel's favorite heroes have a snowy holiday.\nThe ski chalet variant cover series will be available from Marvel Comics starting December 6.\nSource: Marvel Comics\nJonathan Jones is a freelance comics content writer at Screen Rant, reviewing new issues and generally nerding out online.

Here’s what the creators and crew say on the subject.\nIn attempts to ease their viewers' concerns, the creators and crew of Rick and Morty have spoken candidly about the process of recasting Justin Roiland for season 7. Co-creator Roiland, who voiced the titular interdimensional adventurers, was fired from Adult Swim's hit series following a series of abuse allegations. Adult Swim decided, however, to continue the series, opting to recast Roiland's characters.\nJustin Roiland created Rick and Morty with Dan Harmon, who also functions as the show's primary writer. After six highly successful seasons, the show will return with Rick and Morty season 7. However, the Rick and Morty cast will feature two new actors in Roiland's roles. Nevertheless, writers and producers have stated they are confident in maintaining the level of quality, some even claiming season 7 is an improvement.\nRick and Morty producer, Steve Levy, has confirmed that the new actors portraying Rick and Morty will sound like Justin Roiland. Asked whether the show would change the voices following Roiland's recasting, possibly addressed by the show's multiverse plot lines and meta-narratives, Levy stated that the voices would remain the same. Levy commented that \"the characters are the same characters,\" and the transition into a new cast would be seamless (via IGN).\nIn a recent interview, Rick and Morty co-creator, Dan Harmon, discussed his professional relationship with Roiland throughout the show's history. Despite creating the hit series together, a divide between the two quickly developed after Harmon employed several fellow writers from Community for Rick and Morty season 2. Roiland slowly withdrew from the writers' room, as Harmon observed: \"I’d come to find out later that it was like, ‘Oh, Harmon brought in his Harmon writers,’ and, man, that is not how I saw it.\" The pair's relationship would never recover and, reportedly, they have not spoken to each other since 2019.\nDan Harmon also discussed his reaction to the Justin Roiland allegations. Harmon initially declined to comment on the abuse allegations but has since decided he cannot remain silent and expressed his sympathies and remorse. Harmon also has stated his regret over not commenting earlier, saying:\n\"It’s other people’s safety and comfort that got damaged while I obsessed over a cartoon’s quality. Trust has now been violated between countless people and a show designed to please them. I’m frustrated, ashamed and heartbroken that a lot of hard work, joy and passion can be leveraged to exploit and harm strangers.\"\nAdult Swim President Michael Ouweleen also clarified that the cast for Rick and Morty season 7 would not be imitators and explained audiences won't notice Justin Roiland's recast. Despite stating that the new Rick and Morty voices will sound like Roiland, Ouweleen reiterates that the Rick and Morty protagonists would remain the same, in every respect, despite very minor differences in performance. Ouweleen likened the circumstance to successive Bugs Bunny actors: \"It's not Mel Blanc! And yet we recognize the character. I even think that for Rick and Morty we will do even better... It will be fine. It'll be great.\"\nWriter and producer Steve Levy has suggested Rick and Morty season 7 is better without Roiland involved. While commenting on the writing team behind Rick and Morty season 7, Levy expressed great enthusiasm, praising the team for maintaining the same level of quality as the previous beloved seasons. Both Levy and Ouweleen have asserted that the season will certainly not suffer creatively without Roiland, with Levy stating:\n\"The work that we’re doing across the board has only gotten better. When the new season comes out, we’ll focus on how amazing it all turned out. We hope the fans will realize that this is the same old show, maybe even better!”\nSteve Levy has also stated the reason they decided Rick and Morty would continue without Roiland. Levy acknowledges the hardworking writing team who have contributed greatly to Rick and Morty's success over the years as the primary factor in continuing the series. Levy says:\n\"It would have been very easy to just say, ‘I’m done and I don’t want to do anything with this show anymore.’ But our crew said, ‘No, we’re not going to let one person drag down all of our hard work.’ This show is created by this team — this family of incredibly hardworking people, and we are going to push through and show the world that we aren’t going to miss a beat.\"\nOuweleen has wholly supported the plan to recast Rick and Morty for season 7. While commenting on the importance of vocal performance in animation, Ouweleen reiterated his support for the Rick and Morty writing team and the recasting efforts. Ouweleen said:\n\"Listen: voices are obviously super important in an animated series. And, of course, none of us wanted to go through what we went through. But I've been in animation for a long time, and I know that what makes a series is its different parts coming together. If the voices are obviously a big part, there is also the writing of the characters, their design... I have reason to believe that the transition will go well.\"\nDiscussing the future of Rick and Morty, Dan Harmon has revealed talks with Warner Bros. Studios to make a feature-length Rick and Morty movie. Referring to it as a \"super episode,\" Harmon drew a comparison with the South Park movie, Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Harmon also suggested that Rick and Morty could continue for decades, drawing a comparison with long-running animation, The Simpsons.\nRELATED: 10 Rick & Morty Story Ideas That Would Be Perfect For Dan Harmon's Movie\nThe first glimpse at the actors cast to replace Roiland has been revealed in Rick and Morty's season 7 trailer. The trailer provides several snippets of dialogue from each of the titular characters, which seemingly have adhered to Levy and Ouweleen's assertions. While there are some very minor changes in performance, the characters are essentially the same. While clearly not imitations, they are very clearly still Rick and Morty.\nAdult Swim has elected not to reveal the names of the actors cast as Rick and Morty until the season premiere on October 15, 2023. This comes after the performers featured heavily throughout the season's trailer. Despite perpetuating the casting mystery a little longer, it is unlikely to be an earth-shattering revelation, as Harmon has said the actors are \"unknown.\" Nevertheless, Rick and Morty season 7 is eagerly awaited, with many keen to know if the series will be the same without Roiland.\nRichard Craig is a musician and writer based in Brighton, UK. Recently completing an MA degree in Music and Sound Art, Richard has written extensively about movie genre studies and film soundtracks, paying particular attention to the horror genre and appearances of folk music. Richard's Bachelor's degree dissertation was chosen for publication in the first major academic collection on the folk horror genre, The Routledge Companion to Folk Horror. Released in October 2023, Richard's chapter explores the relationship between the Estonian horror movie November, and Estonian rune songs. Richard is also an accomplished film score composer, and most notably performed a live soundtrack to the 1922 silent film essay Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages. "}

Goyer, showrunner of the Apple TV Plus show Foundation, teases how the Mule will impact season 3 of the hit science-fiction story.\nFoundation showrunner David S. Goyer teases how new villain the Mule will shake up a prospective season 3 of the hit Apple TV Plus series. First released on the streamer in 2021, Goyer's series is loosely based on source material from acclaimed author Isaac Asimov. The explosive Foundation season 2 finale recently aired on Apple TV Plus last month, setting up an even more thrilling story to come with Mikael Persbrandt's the Mule poised to be a central figure.\nNow, as audiences await news regarding the not-yet-confirmed Foundation season 3, Goyer teases in an interview with TVLine how the Mule will factor into the story going forward. The showrunner hypes up the villain's immense power, promising that things are only going to get more intense in the episodes to come. Check out Goyer's full comment below:\n\n“Yes, he is super scary. He’s magnitudes of order more powerful than Tellem. When Asimov created [the Mule], it was a character that flipped the whole table over. When the Mule enters the story properly in [a potential] Season 3, that’s completely what he does… As crazy as the end of Season 2 is, Season 3 is even crazier. You haven’t seen anything yet.”\n\n“Yes, he is super scary. He’s magnitudes of order more powerful than Tellem. When Asimov created [the Mule], it was a character that flipped the whole table over.

Despite these strong reviews, however, the sci-fi show hasn't actually be renewed for season 3 yet. Season 2 was confirmed back in October 2021, before the first batch of episodes had even finished airing, and the lack of a renewal in the same time frame for season 3 could be interpreted as somewhat concerning.\nThat being said, the impact of the WGA strike in this case cannot be understated. Beginning earlier this year in May, the writers strike is almost certainly why Apple has not yet announced season 3. With the strike now over, it's entirely possible that an announcement is imminent. Goyer himself is evidently very confident in the show's future, recently revealing that he has charted a course for Foundation up to season 8.\nWhat's more, Foundation remains a surprisingly affordable series, at least for what it is. The budget for season 2 has yet to be made public, but season 1 cost only $45 million, a very small sum considering what competitors are spending on the likes of The Rings of Power and Stranger Things. With a season 2 budget that is probably a little larger but still relatively modest, and with impressive performance on various popularity metrics, it's looking likely that Goyer will indeed get to explore the Mule's impact on the story in Foundation season 3.\nSource: TVLine\n"}
{"title": "Friday The 13th: Every Filming Location In The Horror Movie Franchise", "date": "2023-10-02 20:41:26", "text": "Friday the 13th has used a variety of locations to depict Camp Crystal Lake over the years. Here's where each movie in the franchise was shot. \nWARNING: Spoilers ahead for Friday the 13th.\nThe Friday the 13th series is one of the most iconic franchises of the horror genre due mainly to its iconic setting of Camp Crystal Lake, which was shot in various locations. Jason Voorhees owes much of his villainous notoriety to his wooded hunting grounds that have served as the site for dozens of his gruesome killings in his notorious hockey mask. Camp Crystal Lake is an essential component of the Friday the 13th series since it was where the vengeful horror legend was born. It has become nearly as iconic as its evil resident slasher Jason, considering how the fictional summer campground established a thematic standard for modern slasher films and the horror genre in the past few decades.\nCrystal Lake's heavy forest setting provides dense coverage for Jason to hide under the cover of darkness as he picks off his unsuspecting victims one by one. The simple log cabins at Camp Crystal Lake provide limited hiding spaces for those unfortunate enough to get caught in Jason's violent grasp, most of whom are smoking, drinking, or engaging in other forms of youthful debauchery. The lake itself is the place where Jason drowned due to his counselors' negligence and marked the original story of Jason's dark upbringing. Given the significance of Camp Crystal Lake to the overall story of Jason Voorhees, here are all the Friday the 13th shooting locations listed by the franchise's chronology.\nRELATED: Every Friday The 13th Movie Ranked By Kill Count\nThe real-world setting of the first Friday the 13th film is by far the most famous. The grounds used for Camp Crystal Lake is a Boy Scout retreat called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco located in Hardwick, New Jersey. The camp is still operating to this day, but unfortunately, that means that fans can't visit the site without getting in trouble for trespassing. However, No-Be-Bo-Sco occasionally holds elaborate Crystal Lake Tours on select Friday the 13th days complete with props and memorabilia.\nNearby Blairstown, where Crystal Lake's own town was shot, also pays tribute to the film with an exhibit at the Blairstown Museum that expanded to a full-on Friday the 13th museum. Locals express that the date of Friday the 13th has become a sort of holiday for the community and the town holds a \"Jason Fest\" to celebrate the film's legacy. The Roy's Hall concert venue in Blairstown typically screens Friday the 13th on these days as well as appearing in a shot of the film itself. Interior shots were also shot next door to Blairstown in Hope.\nThe sequel moved its filming locations from New Jersey to Connecticut, shooting in the rural and heavily wooded county of Litchfield. The village of New Preston provided the backdrop for downtown scenes including the casino where the counselors visited the bar. The cabins along Camp Kenmont's North Spectacle Pond, located just outside the town of Kent, were where Jason stalked his prey at Camp Crystal Lake. In addition, the city of Waterbury, located in the much more urbanized eastern part of Connecticut, was where audiences visited the house of the sole survivor of the first film, Alice Hardy.\nUnfortunately, the sets for this entry have not been nearly as well-preserved as those for the first film. Alice's house in Waterbury has been demolished, although interior scenes were shot in what is now a rehabilitation center in Torrington. The casino in New Preston was a popular nightlife spot for years before completely burning down. Camp Kenmont is still active but the property was sold to another owner. The residences on North Spectacle Pond called Bromica Lodge were also destroyed.\nPart III marks the first time that a Friday the 13th film was not shot on the East Coast since the crew needed a more controlled environment to regulate the movie's 3D effects. Instead, production took place in Veluzat Motion Picture Ranch in Santa Clarita, California with its own constructed barn, cabin, and lake. The ranch is still used to this day as a production site, but the cabin that was used in the film burned down in 2012. In addition, the scene with the biker gang was shot at what is now the Green Valley Cafe in the Santa Clarita area.\nRELATED: 10 Jason Voorhees Cosplays That Should Be Inspiration For A Friday The 13th Reboot\nThe opening to The Final Chapter was also at Veluzat Ranch but the rest of the film takes place in different locations. The expendable teens went skinny-dipping in the waters of Zaca Lake while they hiked along the trails that surround the area. Strangely, the Zaca Lake Lodge marks the third time so far that a Friday the 13th shooting location burned down, this time more recently in 2016. The place is a popular filming site with its ties to Hollywood productions going all the way back to the silent era. The lake was also where the Universal Monster classic Creature from the Black Lagoon was shot. In addition, the residence of Tommy Jarvis and his family is a privately owned house in Topanga, CA.\nProduction for the Friday the 13th series remained in California in various locations around the Los Angeles area. As opposed to the other entries in the franchise, a chunk of the action was shot in the middle of an urban area, albeit in the idyllic Franklin Canyon Park, tucked inside the Beverly Hills portion of the Santa Monica Mountains. The Pineway Halfway House where Tommy Jarvis is institutionalized is a privately-owned property called Rancho Rosito located in Camarillo, California. Corey Feldman's cameo was shot in his own backyard as he was too who was busy shooting The Goonies to appear on set.\nFor the sixth film, production was primarily moved down south to Georgia. The town scenes, including the sheriff's office where Tommy Jarvis fails to convince the law that Jason is back from the dead, were shot in Covington. Located outside of Atlanta, the small city shares common ground with Rob Zombie's Halloween II which was also shot there. The camp scenes took place in Camp Daniel Morgan around Hard Labor Creek State Park's Lake Rutledge a couple of miles east of Covington. Luckily, the camp still exists and holds occasional tours and screenings, perhaps because Jason Lives is so well-beloved by Friday the 13th fans.\nA point of contention exists over which cemetery Jason emerged from at the beginning of the film. Fansites often state that it was Covington Cemetary, but screencap comparisons and recovered call sheet documents reveal that it was actually Old Madison Cemetary in Madison, GA. It's comforting to know that what is considered arguably the most entertaining entry in the series has had its shooting locations comparatively well-preserved.\nRELATED: 10 Ways Jason Lives Saved The Friday The 13th Franchise\nProduction for The New Blood stayed in the south but moved over to neighboring Alabama, specifically within Baldwin County and around the city of Mobile. Byrnes Lake was chosen for the primary outdoor location, although the cabins were all constructed for the film only to be torn down once production ended. There was even a gator wrangler hired to be on set in case the beasts attacked the cast and crew but fortunately, the gators weren't active during the time of the shooting. A number of interiors were also built in Los Angeles for filming and the crew went back to Topanga Canyon, California for the interiors of the house.\nJason's trip to New York City infamously doesn't even take place within The Big Apple for the majority of the movie. Despite the fact that Jason Takes Manhattan was the most expensive Friday the 13th film to date, its $5 million budget still wouldn't cover the would-be cost of shooting entirely in New York. Production took place mostly in Vancouver and surrounding areas within British Columbia as well as with some interior shots in Los Angeles. The only scene that was legitimately shot in New York was in Times Square, which attracted a sizable crowd of Friday the 13th fans to watch Jason actor Kane Hodder perform in the hockey mask.\nThe crew returned to southern California to shoot the ninth installment in Thousand Oaks. The town contained the Canyon Ranch Studio for outdoor production, as well as nearby urban locales such as Joey B.'s Diner. The Voorhees residence where Jason goes to hell was filmed at a private house in the suburban West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, specifically on Eagle Mountain Street.\nRELATED: 10 Best Summer Camp Movies\nThe horror sci-fi crossover Jason X takes place entirely on a spaceship. The film crew used a soundstage to construct the sets in Toronto, Canada. There are no Camp Crystal Lake locales to be found here beyond a virtual simulation that's created for part of the movie. However, Jason X includes a fun cameo appearance where director David Cronenberg gets stabbed and showcases one of the franchise's most creative kills with Jason killing someone in a vat of liquid nitrogen.\nAfter years of teasing audiences and studio meddling, the big crossover between two icons of the slasher sub-genre, Freddy vs. Jason, was born. It was shot in and around Vancouver, using an impressive amount of on-location settings compared to the past few previous films. Jason's shack was located along the shore of the picturesque Buntzen Lake, although the set was demolished after filming. However, there were also some interiors and street shots that were filmed on a Universal Studios lot in Hollywood.\nRELATED: How Does Freddy vs. Jason Still Hold This Horror Record After 20 Years?\nThe 2009 remake of Friday the 13th took the action to Central Texas around the Austin area. Neighboring Bastrop provided outdoor recreation areas for camp scenes on Friday the 13th, while Austin, Round Rock, and Wimberley contained on-location structures like houses and stores. The city of Austin itself conveniently holds film studios for a more controlled environment as well. Additionally, the crew also traveled to Camp Fern in the East Texas town of Marshall to shoot more on-location outdoor scenes.\n"}

Director Larry Charles (Borat) and writers Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp have brought the earnest bravado of Broadway (or more accurately a half-hour performance born from Upright Citizens Bridage training) to the big screen with a star-studded cast and show-stopping numbers. Jackson and Sharp, who also originated the original show, star as two identical twins who accidentally reconnect at work and set out to reunite their family.\nTheir parents are played by Megan Mullally (Will & Grace) and Nathan Lane (The Birdcage), who give some of the most outlandish performances of their career — which is really saying something. Dicks: The Musical also stars Megan Thee Stallion as a \"lady boss\" who will take no disrespect from her underlings and Saturday Night Live's Bowen Yang as the movie's fabulous and fashion-forward incarnation of God. If that sounds like the recipe for a good time, just wait to see how wild it gets as the show goes on.\nRelated: The 20 Best Musicals Of All Time\nScreen Rant spoke with stars Megan Mullally & Nathan Lane about getting into their Parent Trap-esque characters for Dicks: The Musical, finding their voices for set, and cozying up to the animatronic creatures known as the Sewer Boys. Note: While this interview was conducted during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, A24 has an interim agreement in place with the union in order to compensate creatives fairly and promote their films.\nScreen Rant: I loved the running joke of not knowing who was Trevor and who was Craig, even though you are their parents.\nMegan Mullally: I don't know in real life which one is Josh and which is Aaron. Do you?\nNathan Lane: Not always.\nMegan Mullally: I'm unclear. [Laughs] No, we love them. They're the best.\nNathan Lane: I liked that joke, too. I liked it when they couldn't remember.\nDid you guys mix up the character name sometimes, saying the right name instead?\nMegan Mullally: Yeah. I did, for sure.\nMegan, I love the voice that you found for Evelyn. How did you find her, and then connect that to your singing?\nMegan Mullally: Oh, thank you. Well, it came to me in a dream. [Laughs] I don't know. I always just have a very weird, ephemeral way of coming up with characters, I guess. Not logical; more just my gut.\nNick was running lines with me before we ever started, and I was doing it, and Nick liked it. And then when we first started rehearsing, there were a few people maybe who didn't like it; producer types, in that realm, and maybe it was suggested to me that I not do it. And I said, \"Well, I am going to do it,\" and I did it. So, that's how it happened.\nNathan, Harris and the Sewer Boys is his own little family melodrama there. How close did you have to get to those puppets?\nNathan Lane: That's the sequel. Harris and the Sewer Boys: Dicks Continued.\nWell, very close. I had to spit ham into their mouth. Yes, close. I got close physically and emotionally. That's what happens when you rescue Sewer Boys. It's such a bizarre thing. The Sewer Boys had a history because, in the original sketch, they were just referenced. You never saw them, and it was suggested that perhaps he was having sex with them.\nOh?!\nNathan Lane: That very reaction was what I believe A24 and Peter Chernin Entertainment thought, too. In fact, a group of men went, \"Oh?!\" And they said, \"That's where I believe if there is a line on this film, this is where we're going to draw it, and Harris cannot be having sex with anyone with Boys in their name.\" The notion of human actors playing them, guys from Cirque de Soleil swinging in the cage, that was done away with, and it had to be puppets.\nI hope that no puppeteers were harmed in the making of throwing ham at the Sewer Boys.\nNathan Lane: I don't think so. I think I had a pretty good aim. But these aren't sophisticated puppets. I mean. Maybe I vaguely remember some sort of animatronic bit, where maybe their mouths might move a little. I don't know. But, essentially, it was just two or three people with sticks going like this. It was a lot of this; just people doing that. And so they would go like this.

{"title": "Are Any Of The Ghosts Real In A Haunting In Venice?", "date": "2023-10-02 20:30:28", "text": "Ghosts are at the heart of Kenneth Branagh’s A Haunting in Venice, but are the supernatural forces actually present or can they be explained away?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for A Haunting in Venice.\nWhile most of A Haunting in Venice’s mysteries are neatly tied up, the story remains elusive when it comes to the reality of its titular haunting. The film, Kenneth Branagh’s third outing as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, finds itself blending genres and breaking with numerous series conventions. In A Haunting in Venice, a retired, disillusioned Poirot is invited to witness a séance at the home of an opera singer who wishes to commune with her late daughter. However, the macabre evening takes an even darker turn when the psychic medium is found dead, with a retired Poirot forced to take on the case.\nA Haunting in Venice is the first of Branagh’s three Hercule Poirot movies to change its name from the original book’s title, and it diverges from the source material in other ways. Agatha Christie’s novel Hallowe’en Party takes place at an English estate rather than a Venetian Palazzo. While the central mystery is largely the same, the book does not feature a séance, nor do ghosts play a major part in the story. The decision to focus more heavily on the supernatural elements imbues A Haunting in Venice with an affecting atmosphere. However, it’s unclear whether the film’s many ghosts are another misdirection or a confirmation of the supernatural.\nWhile A Haunting in Venice’s cast of characters spends the entire movie being menaced by apparently supernatural forces, the vast majority of these occurrences can be rationally explained. The troubling visions of ghosts and sounds of children’s laughter that Poirot hears throughout the film are in line with the legend that the Palazzo is haunted by the spirits of children, and the deceased Alicia Drake appears to Poirot multiple times throughout the film, both as a child and in her drowned form. However, these visions can largely be explained as the result of drinking tea laced with Rowena Drake’s (Kelly Reilly) hallucinogenic honey.\nOther supernatural occurrences can be explained with a plot spearheaded by Tina Fey’s Haunting in Venice character, Ariadne Oliver, in order to generate material for a best-selling book about Hercule Poirot being stumped by the medium Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh). Ariadne and Poirot’s ex-detective bodyguard, Vitale (Riccardo Scamarcio), feed Joyce information about the Alicia Drake case and about Poirot’s life in order to give her the appearance of psychic clairvoyance. Joyce’s accusation that someone murdered Alicia Drake is contrived as a means of injecting drama into Ariadne’s planned book. Unfortunately, their lie proves prescient, resulting in Joyce’s murder at the hands of Alicia Drake’s killer.\nWhile the plot rationally explains away most of its hauntings, some vaguely supernatural occurrences are purposefully left unexplained. The young Leopold Ferrier (Jude Hill) seems to actually be imbued with the ability to speak with the Palazzo’s ghosts. Leopold claims that the spectral children told him Joyce Reynolds is a fake, a claim that proves true. Leopold also seems capable of hearing the children’s laughter like Poirot does, implying that it’s not an auditory hallucination at all. While Rowena Drake’s death is apparently the result of her slipping over the balcony, a split-second manifestation of the drowned Alicia Drake appears to pull her over.\nWhat’s more, the teacup in Alicia’s room may be a signal of her spectral presence. The falling teacup causes Poirot to find a photo that sets A Haunting in Venice's ending in motion by triggering the realization of Alicia’s true killer. However, the teacup isn't jostled or moved in any way. Having been in the same position for months, it happens to fall at the precise moment that leads to Alicia’s murderer being brought to justice. All of these individual details are small, but they paint a larger picture of a supernatural force that is difficult to dismiss.\nThe ambiguity of the ghosts in A Haunting in Venice is central to the film’s themes of faith and cynicism. At the outset of the story, Poirot’s past dealings have brought him to a point of utter disillusionment wherein the existence of ghosts, God, or any kind of cosmic justice seems impossible. However, this airtight certainty is keeping the detective from living his life. The events of A Haunting in Venice — both the real and the apparently supernatural — force him to acknowledge that he could be wrong about the nihilism of the universe. Ultimately, the only way to honor the ghosts of the past is to accept their existence.\n"}
{"title": "How Many People Actually Live in Judge Dredd's Mega-City One", "date": "2023-10-02 20:30:28", "text": "The population of Judge Dredd’s Mega-City One has gone through major changes over the decades due to various devastating events in its history.\nMega-City One is as much a character in Judge Dredd comics as the titular iron-jawed street judge. Unimaginably vast, the city covers the entire eastern seaboard of the United States, stretching from the northernmost part of America (including parts of Canada) to the southernmost tip of the Florida peninsula. The megalopolis is also densely populated, serving as home to hundreds of millions of people.\nThe sprawling supercity made its first appearance in the Judge Dredd universe in the late 1970s via comic stories by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra published in 2000 AD. Since its introduction, Mega-City One would see its massive population take hit after serious hit. Various wars and pestilence over the decades would significantly reduce the number of people living in the city.\nRelated: Judge Dredd Art Shows What Even Movie Fans Missed About Mega-City One\nJudge Dredd’s city started as an extended urban area stretching from Washington, D.C. to the Big Apple in the late 2020s. It was intended as a metropolitan area that connects the nation’s capital to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other East Coast states, providing housing and work for those living in and around the region. Its population would balloon in the next few years, laying the foundation of what would become the first American mega-city. It would quickly expand in size to accommodate the unstoppable growth of its population, enveloping Massachusetts (and beyond) in the north, Florida in the south, and parts of Ohio in the west.\nIn 2070, the global Atomic War transforms the majority of the United States into radioactive wasteland. Mega-City One survives the nuclear war because of its experimental laser shield technology. But it soon finds itself attracting millions of refugees from less fortunate American cities. The situation forces the city to resort to building towering apartment blocks that can house more than 50,000 people. Block construction over the next 30 years causes Mega-City One’s population to reach 800 million by the start of the 22nd century. By the mid-2100s, however, that number would be reduced to half its size.\nDue to the high crime rate within Mega-City One, death is almost like a daily occurrence for its citizens. Going into the 22nd century, however, the already hardened population would be further traumatized. In 2104, several block wars would erupt across the megalopolis, resulting in major casualties. But that is actually just a diversion manufactured by the Soviet Judges of East-Meg One in Russia to launch a nuclear attack on the southern sectors of Dredd’s home turf, taking 150 million lives. The ensuing radioactive fallout, nuclear winter, and starvation of this event (dubbed the Apocalypse War) would further inflict a massive death count.\nJudge Dredd would later put an end to the war by giving East-Meg One and its no-good Soviet Judges a taste of their own medicine. But the Apocalypse War causes Mega-City One’s population to drop from 800 million to 400 million. Barely just rebuilding after a nuke attack, the city would again face another adversity in the early 2110s thanks to evil witches who turn Mega-City One into a Necropolis ruled by undead judges favoring slaughter over street justice. With Dredd retired (and later becoming amnesiac), the corrupt Justice System would lead to 60 million deaths by 2112.\nIn 2126, terrorists get their hands on a dozen nuclear weapons and set them off around Mega-City One, instantly killing 4 million. Still reeling after yet another nuclear bombing, the city would be beset just a year later by the Half-Life epidemic, a psychic disease that turns people into murderers, taking another million lives. But these events pale in comparison to 2134’s Day of Chaos, wherein a biological WMD wipes out nearly 90 percent of Mega-City One’s population. From 400 million inhabitants three decades before, that number drops to about 40 million by the mid-2130s.\nStill, those major events don’t keep the megalopolis down for long. By the start of the 2140s, Mega-City One would see its population recover relatively quickly to breach the 100 million mark, taking into account the constant influx of immigrants after the events of the Day of Chaos. By the year 2145, the population estimate is around 130 million. But if Mega-City One's history in Judge Dredd teaches anything, that number will likely take another major hit soon.\nGuile Canencia is a freelance writer from Cebu, Philippines.

{"title": "How Old Star Trek’s New Vulcan Is Compared To Spock & T’Pol", "date": "2023-10-02 20:16:30", "text": "Star Trek: Lower Decks' T'Lyn revealed her age, but how does she compare to Enterprise's T'Pol and Strange New Worlds' Lt. Spock?\nStar Trek: Lower Decks' new Vulcan, Lieutenant T'Lyn (Gabrielle Ruiz), is of comparable age to Star Trek: Enterprise's Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and she is older than Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' Lieutenant Spock (Ethan Peck). T'Lyn was introduced in Lower Decks season 2 as a Lower Decker serving on the Vulcan ship Sh'vhal. When T'Lyn saved her ship during a conflict between Klingons, Pakleds, and the USS Cerritos, she was transferred to Starfleet and stationed on the Cerritos as a provisional Ensign. However, T'Lyn was quickly promoted to Lieutenant, junior grade.\nVulcans are relatively long-lived and can roughly double the lifespan of humans, although some elderly Vulcans can develop Bendii Syndrome, a neurological disease that affects their telepathy. In Star Trek: Lower Decks' late 24th century era, numerous Vulcans serve in Starfleet, but this was a much rarer thing in previous generations of Star Trek. T'Pol was the first Vulcan to join Starfleet in Star Trek: Enterprise season 3, and when Spock became a Starfleet Officer a century later, Vulcans in Starfleet were still relatively uncommon compared to the 24th century. Spock did attend Starfleet Academy, which neither T'Pol nor T'Lyn did, which accounts for why the two female Vulcans were introduced to be much older than the iconic Mr. Spock.\nRelated: Star Trek: Lower Decks Cast Guide - Who Voices Each Character In All 4 Seasons\nIn Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4, episode 5, \"Empathological Fallacies,\" Lt. T'Lyn told Lt. Beckett Mariner (Tawny Newsome) that she is 62 years old, to which Mariner responded, \"62? You look great, by the way.\" T'Lyn's age lines up with T'Pol's, who was 63 years old when Star Trek: Enterprise began, which was set in 2251. Comparatively, Lt. Spock was only 29 in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1. Spock was born in 2230 on Vulcan, and he is about 36 in Star Trek: The Original Series when Spock is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy.\nSpock chose to attend Starfleet Academy instead of the Vulcan Science Academy, which created a rift between him and his father, Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard/James Frain). Both T'Lyn and T'Pol ended up in Starfleet by circumstance; T'Pol was originally a Vulcan observer on the inaugural mission of the NX-01 Enterprise commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and she chose to remain aboard the Earth vessel before eventually aligning her loyalty from the Vulcan High Command to Starfleet. T'Lyn was transferred to Starfleet as a punishment for being \"too emotional\" and \"out of control,\" and she desperately tried to return to the Sh'vhal before deciding to remain on the Cerritos.\nAlthough she is Star Trek's newest (an increasingly popular) Vulcan character, T'Lyn was definitely inspired by her Vulcan predecessors. As a Vulcan in Starfleet, T'Lyn evokes Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley/Robin Curtis) from the Star Trek movies, and her headband and hairstyle are reminiscent of the treacherous Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall) from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Like T'Pol, T'Lyn unwillingly found herself serving on a Starfleet ship, and her dissatisfaction and issues with her Vulcan superiors led her to question whether she is \"Vulcan enough.\" And, similar to T'Pol, T'Lyn has to get used to how humans smell as they offend the superior olfactory senses of Vulcan females.\nT'Lyn and T'Pol are nearly identical ages when they come aboard their Starfleet ships, just like Spock and Tuvok (Tim Russ) are of comparable ages in their early Starfleet careers. Like Spock, Tuvok was 29 when he served on the USS Excelsior commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) in 2293. Lt. Tuvok was 93 years old when he came aboard the USS Voyager commanded by Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) at the start of Star Trek: Voyager, and Captain Tuvok is 137 when he appears in Star Trek: Picard season 3, circa 2401. Star Trek: Lower Decks' Lt. T'Lyn is hopefully still alive in Star Trek: Picard season 3, and she would be around 80 years old.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "There’s One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP", "date": "2023-10-02 20:16:30", "text": "One Phantom Liberty side quest unlocks a whole new way to earn legendary rewards. Here’s how to find and complete it in the Cyberpunk 2077 DLC.\nCyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC brings many new side quests to the open world of Night City, but one in particular shouldn't be skipped. Naturally, the main focus of the Phantom Liberty DLC is on its tense, twisted spy thriller of a story. Even so, some of its side quests do a wonderful job of expanding its world, getting the player acquainted with the notable people, places, and things of Dogtown to ease them along their journey.\nBut not all side quests are exactly the same. While some of them tie into the setting or expand on the story, others are simple, skippable fetch quests that don't offer much beyond material compensation. Still others, though, are more than worthwhile because of the new mechanics, shops, or items they unlock. These rewards can stick with the player throughout the DLC and beyond, changing even the base game of Cyberpunk 2077 in meaningful ways. Those side quests are worth looking out for, but can sometimes be hard to find.\nRelated: One Cyberpunk 2077 Choice Will Ruin Your Phantom Liberty Playthrough\nCompleting the Phantom Liberty side job \"Push it to the Limit\" unlocks a whole new feature in the DLC: the ability to undertake Vehicle Contracts. These are often simple, quick driving missions in which V has to steal a designated car, then drive it to a buyer while swerving around enemies. Vehicle Contracts allow the DLC to showcase the brand-new vehicular combat mechanic, which was added to the game in Cyberpunk 2077's free 2.0 update. Since each one is centered around a different car, these quests also give players an opportunity to test drive some of Phantom Liberty's coolest new vehicles.\nCyberpunk 2077's Vehicle Contracts are also notable for their rewards, which may include crafting components, rare weapons, weapon attachments, and a variety of different Shard types. Shards can be exchanged for different rewards, which are mostly self-explanatory. Money Shards can be turned into eurodollars, and Skill Shards grant a slight XP bump to the relevant ability. Vehicle Contracts may also reward V with Autofixer Discount Shards, which can be traded in for price cuts at Night City's many car dealers. These can stack up to a 100% discount, allowing V to get new cars absolutely free if they save up enough.\nIn order to accept the Cyberpunk 2077 quest \"Push it to the Limit,\" players must first complete Phantom Liberty's story through the main quest \"Spider and the Fly.\" Once V has finished the first three introductory missions and returned to the full open world, they may see a small, blue-green steering wheel icon on the map in Pacifica. If they pull up near it, they'll see a bright yellow car, and receive a call from El Capitan goading them into stealing it. V should hop into the driver's seat and head toward the destination.\nBut before long, a caravan of gang members pull up behind V. They'll do everything they can to stop the car from getting to El Capitan's garage. V can either take out their pursuers or shake them off; with the new vehicular combat mechanic, they can fire weapons out the window to keep the pressure on. If they make enough noise during the first leg of the chase, the police may show up to further complicate things. V doesn't need to arrive unharmed, but they do need to arrive intact, so sometimes it's better to avoid a fight than to drive right into one.\nOnce V parks in the designated garage, El Capitan emerges and congratulates them on a job well done. In short, he wants to repeat the same scheme over and over again, paying V to steal desirable cars and deliver them to exacting buyers across the city. With that, Vehicle Contracts become available all over the map. V can start undertaking them at any time, simply by opening the door of a target car and heading toward the destination. When they do, they'll know they're headed in the right direction if the quest title \"Just Another Story\" pops up in the top right corner of the screen.\nFor the most part, future Vehicle Contract quests don't change much from V's initial brush with El Capitan. Of course, the vehicles themselves are often different, as are the places where they're parked and the locations of the buyers V has to deliver them to. They can be found on the map with the same blue-green steering wheel icon that marks the original \"Push it to the Limit\" quest.\nWhat does make future Vehicle Contracts more interesting, though, are the optional objectives the later ones include. They're not strictly required, but they do directly affect the amount and quality of the rewards V receives, so it's worth keeping an eye on them and at least trying to adhere. There are four possible optional objectives: a time limit, a hostile tail, a hacking challenge, or an \"undamaged\" condition. Satisfying a Vehicle Contract's optional condition means V will be treated to an extra crate full of Tier Five items - Legendary weapons, armor, and attachments - upon completion of the job.\nTime limits work exactly as expected, with a clock constantly ticking down until the extra rewards expire. Sometimes, V will instead be pursued by the car's rightful owner, rival thieves, police, or all of the above, as they were in the introductory Vehicle Contract \"Push it to the Limit.\" At other times, they'll have to complete a hacking mini-game before they can even get into the car. The most difficult optional objectives, though, require V to deliver the car completely unharmed. The slightest dent or scratch, and they can wave goodbye to the extra rewards.\nWhile the other side quests in Phantom Liberty are pretty limited in terms of scope, \"Push it to the Limit\" unlocks a whole new category of side activities. Vehicle Contracts might not be the easiest or most popular feature, but they provide a wonderful tour through some of the DLC's new features, and the rewards are more than worth the effort. Even though it's technically optional, the Cyberpunk 2077 side quest \"Push it to the Limit\" should be every player's first priority.\n"}
{"title": "John Carpenter Reunites With Halloween 1978 Cast In Surprise Appearance", "date": "2023-10-02 20:13:50", "text": "John Carpenter makes a surprise appearance at the convention H45: 45 Years of Terror, reuniting with cast members from the 1978 classic Halloween.\nHalloween director John Carpenter had a surprise reunion with cast members from the original movie. The 1978 movie follows the havoc that is wreaked when murderer Michael Myers escapes from a sanitarium and begins stalking the streets of Haddonfield, Illinois, on Halloween night. After becoming one of the most profitable independent movies of all time, Halloween launched a franchise that now includes 13 movies. In addition to directing the original, Carpenter also co-wrote the screenplay and composed the now iconic Halloween score.\nOn Instagram, Halloween Kills performer Douglas Tait shared a video of a moment when John Carpenter made a surprise appearance at the H45: 45 Years of Terror convention in Pasadena on October 1.\nIn Tait's video, Carpenter poses for a photo with Nick Castle, who played \"The Shape\" (the moniker given to the masked Michael Myers) in the original Halloween as well as Blumhouse's recent legacy sequel trilogy. Carpenter also paid a visit to P.J. Soles (Lynda) and Nancy Loomis (Annie), as well as other performers from the 1978 classic before participating in a panel about his iconic movie.\nThis was not a full cast reunion, as some of the surviving cast members including Charles Cyphers (Sheriff Brackett) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) were not present. However, Carpenter's appearance at the event does feel like something of a full-circle moment for his career. Horror has long been central to Carpenter's work, with titles including The Thing, Prince of Darkness, and Village of the Damned dotting his filmography over the years. However, he hasn't directed a horror movie since 2010's The Ward, which is also his final directorial feature at the time of writing.\nCarpenter is now prepping for the release of his Peacock miniseries John Carpenter's Suburban Screams, which features his return to directing (done remotely, in this case). However, this long-awaited comeback has been building for quite some time. While Carpenter hasn't directed a movie or television project since The Ward, he has never been too far from the horror genre in the meantime.\nMost notably, Carpenter returned to the Halloween movies as a producer and co-composer for 2018's Halloween and its sequels, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. However, he has also released multiple albums of his horror-tinged musical compositions, even going on tour to perform them alongside entries from his iconic scores. He also directed music videos for several song releases, co-composed the score for 2022's Firestarter, and made a cameo in the Foo Fighters horror movie Studio 666, presaging his eventual return to the horror genre.\nSource: Douglas Tait/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "The Boys: Gen V Video Shows Another Way [SPOILER]'s Death Is Being Spun In The Media", "date": "2023-10-02 20:13:10", "text": "A new video from The Boys spinoff Gen V shows how Vought International is handling the death of a major character in the eyes of the public.\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for Gen V episodes 1-3!\nA new video from The Boys spinoff Gen V shows a new way the death of Golden Boy (Patrick Schwarzenegger) is being spun by Vought in the media. Episode 1 of the new college-focused spinoff saw Golden Boy kill Godolkin University's Professor Brink (Clancy Brown) before exploding in midair. His sudden actions were because of a discovery he made involving the Woods, a secret Supe testing facility beneath Godolkin.\nNow, Vought International has released a video where Vought CEO Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) spins Golden Boy's death in Gen V for the media.\nIn the video, Ashley claims Golden Boy's death was due to drug use, which resulted in him having \"a full psychotic break.\" However, later episodes of the series reveal his rampage was fueled by what he discovered about the Woods.\nThe characters in Gen V have had to deal with Golden Boy’s death since it happened at the end of episode 1. This has resulted in Andre (Chance Perdomo) heavily investigating the Woods, discovering its existence and sending Emma (Lizze Broadway) there to investigate. The end of episode 3 saw Emma discover Golden Boy’s brother, Sam (Asa Germann), is alive, just as Andre discovers his father, Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas), knows about the experiments.\nGolden Boy’s death was the catalyst for students at Godolkin starting their own investigation into the Woods facility. This will likely result in the core students trying to make the experiments known to the public while also trying to understand why they’re being conducted beneath the school. Since Gen V has five episodes left, the answers may not be clear right away.\nHowever, it seems Emma could be discovered in episode 4, which may lead to more direct conflict between students and the school going forward. If that's the case, then the developments that transpire for the rest of the season will likely be extremely unpredictable. By embracing the same dark elements of The Boys that make it so memorable, Gen V will no doubt help to enhance the universe with its own deadly storyline.\nGen V releases new episodes Fridays on Prime Video.\nSource: Vought International/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "Broadway Legends Talk Writing For Steve Martin On Only Murders In The Building", "date": "2023-10-02 20:00:27", "text": "Benj Pasek, Justin Paul, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman dive deep into “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” from Only Murders season 3.\nOnly Murders in the Building season 3 has brought fun musical flair to the true crime comedy, with a number of standout pieces like “Look for the Light” that would sound at home in any real-world Broadway show. The song with the biggest story impact, however, is “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?”, the tongue-twisting patter song Charles-Hayden Savage (Steve Martin) is set to perform in the in-show musical Death Rattle. The piece keeps sending Savage to “the White Room”, which begins to strain his relationship with Oliver Putnam (Martin Short).\nWith a musical at the heart of Only Murders in the Building season 3, the songs had to hold up to Broadway standards. That’s why Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the award-winning writers behind Dear Evan Hansen and The Greatest Showman, were hired to write or co-write nearly every song the season, including “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” For that song, however, they enlisted two more Broadway legends in Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, who wrote Hairspray. Pasek, Paul, Shaiman, and Wittman even wrote songs for the beloved NBC series Smash.\nRelated: Does Meryl Streep Really Sing In Only Murders In The Building? Her Song With Ashley Park Explained\nBenj Pasek, Justin Paul, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman dove deep into the making of “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” in a fun conversation with Screen Rant. Note: This interview was conducted during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, and the show covered here would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. This interview has also been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nScreen Rant: I realized you all have worked on the same project in Smash, which I used to watch week to week and was crazy about, but had you ever [actually] collaborated other than just being involved in the same general thing?\nScott Wittman: No, we didn’t even meet them on Smash. We were all in separate worlds.\nBenj Pasek: But I do know that they were the nice people who allowed us to get the job on Smash, and that was our first TV job ever. I don't know if I've ever said this to you guys, but I hear that you guys were listening and that you approved our song, or whatever. So, they're the reasons why we got our first television show.\nJustin Paul: We had to jump through their hoops to be able to be approved.\nScott Wittman: We did recommend them. I remember saying, “You should get these young whippersnappers.”\nBenj Pasek: Justin and I have loved Marc and Scott forever. We’ve just been fans, and Smash was a huge, huge opportunity for us. It was the first time, honestly, we ever had a song on television, so it was huge for us. But we have just been fans for a really long time and have always wanted to play in the same sandbox, and never thought that we would ever get the opportunity to do so. And then this became an amazing opportunity to do so.\nDoes that mean that, Justin and Benj, that you got them involved in Only Murders?\nJustin Paul: The way that it came about was all this crazy lovely serendipity, which was [that] we went to college with a lovely woman named Sas Goldberg and she and Benj were together--it happened to be at the same place--on vacation. They were just having a conversation and she was like, “When I get back, I'm going back into the writers’ room. I'm joining, this season, the writers’ room for Only Murders in the Building.” He was like, “Oh my gosh, we're huge fans of that show.” And, saying it in Benj’s typical way of just trying to create a path where there isn't one, he was like, “If there's ever a song, if you need a ditty or something…”\nBenj Pasek: I was hawking our wares.\nJustin Paul: And there was no music in the show, necessarily. There was no plot of any of this, but it was like, \"If you ever need something, we will do it. We love this show. We live on the Upper West Side.\" He was just hawking our credentials of why we should be part of Only Murders in the Building.\nBenj Pasek: Then she called back literally a week later and she's like, \"So, not only do they might want a song, but the entire plot around the season hinges upon a fictional musical. I brought up that you guys might be interested in working on it, and they were like, 'Great!’” So, it was very serendipitous in that way. We knew that there were going to be a couple of song moments, and we honestly just used the moment [for] getting to work with some of our favorite folks. [We asked Marc and Scott] knowing the beautiful reciprocity of the gift that they gave us on Smash, but also, we have always wanted to work with Marc and Scott on something. We're such huge fans; this seemed like such a fun opportunity to get to collaborate.\nJustin Paul: We sort of knew this was a great chance to work with some of our favorite writers and our favorite musical theater idols because we can go to them and say, \"Hey, do you want to work with us writing a song for Steve Martin?\" or, \"Do you want to come along and write a song with us for Meryl Streep?\" So, there was that built in. This is a fun show, [and there’s] a great spirit of collaboration on the show itself. It's all about Broadway. They're getting the best people on Broadway; half of them are already on the show, but it's going to be a whole thing about Broadway. There was going to be an episode about a sitzprobe and about curtain coming down.\nIt's so crazy to us that there’s a TV show on now with these guys and Selena Gomez that's centering all around Broadway this season, and so we were like, \"Why don't we continue that spirit? Let's bring along some of our favorite friends.\" These gentlemen kindly said yes to us, even though they were highly skeptical of what the heck that was going to look like. Maybe skeptical of us, I don't know, but they kindly said, \"Yes, let's get in a room and see what the heck happens.\"\nMarc Shaiman: As you can tell from Justin's last speech, the idea of getting a word in edgewise just seemed like... “How will we write together?” But the truth is, we got together and the four of us started writing lyrics in the most fantastic way--the same way Scott and I do it, and obviously the same way that Justin and Benj do it. We were just the four of us throwing out stuff. Usually, I'm very good at remembering. \"I wrote that. I wrote that,\" on things, which is obnoxious. I do remember those things, but in this case, I can look at the lyric and go, \"I think, but I'm not sure.\" We were all just going at it equally, and it was just fantastic.\nScott Wittman: Because we had never written with anyone else--except for Bette Midler a few times where we wrote songs with her--I really felt like getting in a room was like taking all our clothes off together. So, we did that, and it worked out well.\nLogistically, how did you start the song? Was it just lyrics and rhythm stuff? I imagine you don't necessarily need a piano to get started on this kind of thing.\nScott Wittman: Well, everything starts with a story, so we worked from the script and an outline of what the character was, and what the plot of the mystery was. So, we started with Pickwicks and that has a lot of alliteration; that was the beginning of it, I think.\nBenj Pasek: We worked really collaboratively with John Hoffman (Only Murders in the Building co-creator) who was really trying to hone in on, “What is the idea, specifically, of this patter song?” Even the fact that it was going to be a patter song and that the plot hinged around having a really tough song to be able to sing was then a fun challenge for us of, “How do we then reverse-engineer something that would feel like a challenge to be able to perform?” And then, as Scott is saying, “How do we make that incredibly alliterative,” or “How do we allow it to be complex and tongue twisty and all of that?” And that began to inform our process.\nThen, honestly, the four of us were just in a room starting with lyric first. The first line that we wrote was, \"Which of the Pickwick triplets did it?\" And then it's like, \"Okay. What rhymes with ‘did it’?\" It’s like having a flashlight and you can only see a little bit in front of you, and things get revealed, and everyone just is piping up and contributing different ideas, and slowly but surely we got a little bit further down the path together.\nSo much was made of Steve Martin's character not being able to do this throughout the season. How was it when he actually got the song? Is it as much of a challenge as it's made out to be?\nScott Wittman: A challenge to sing? Yes. I think he really loved the song and I think he was very happy when he was done with it; a combination of the two. But he worked extremely hard. I mean, it was hard. It was a lot of pre-records and singing live, and he had to wrap his tongue around all those vowels. So yes.\nI was going to ask if the vocals were recorded live [for the one that was in the show], or if that was pre-record. Or was it a mix? \nJustin Paul: It's a little bit of a mix. Well, what ended up in the TV broadcast is a little bit of a mix. Typically, you're going to go in with a pre-record; that is the plan. What’s actually amazing is that number… I can't remember what caused the delay, but some days got pushed and stuff, and so they ended up having like two or three hours to shoot that number in what was supposed to be a whole day shoot, or something like that. Of course, of all the numbers that get squeezed like that, it's like, “Really? This one?” So it’s that much more impressive when you watch Steve execute it, knowing that he was literally under the gun.\nScott Wittman: It was adorable, too, because Marty had wrapped, and Meryl had wrapped, and they all stayed to watch Steve do it. It was really sweet. It’s a lovely group up there. They really enjoy each other.\nEven watching the show, it seems like that's kind of the energy, which is great.\nScott Wittman: And in my whole life in show business, this is one of the only things we wrote that there were no notes from anyone.\nMarc Shaiman: That's true. I don't know if you've seen the video; the guys have posted some of it. We made a video of just us reciting the lyrics, with Justin and I just playing a little bit, and they just kind of went, \"Yeah, that's it.\"\nJustin Paul: Well, we worked hard on it guys. I think that was hopefully due to the good work that we all did together and also really careful plotting from John in the writer's room. They knew how they wanted to use the song. We had so much direction. I think another thing about the writing process that was so fun for us was [that] I feel like a lot of what we did was reverse engineering, so just sitting around thinking \"What are the most delicious pairings of murder and infanthood? And what are fun rhymes of an investigation and babies? How can we pair these things up?” It was really, in the best way, the one-upmanship of, like, \"What about this?” “Oh no, we can add one more rhyme in there.” Then, once we had all those assembled, \"Okay, this is our arsenal here. How do we put these to use in creating a song?”\nAnd there were some things where we were like, \"This is so good, but we can't squeeze it in.\" But a lot of it was really loving. A patter song… this is sort of a puzzle anyway, so it was really [about] identifying some of our favorite pieces and then putting them together. It was like, \"How zany can we be? How far can we go?\" In video that Marc is talking about, if you listen closely, you'll hear us say, \"Will the baby get fried for matricide?\" We did get one note, and the note was, \"I don't think we want to put on the broadcast the image of an infant and an electric chair, so we're going to say, ‘Will the baby get tried’,\" Which was equally fitting and makes sense to a courtroom and a case and a murder. They didn't want to evoke electrifying a young toddler.\nProps for getting the word “triptych” in a song, too.\nMarc Shaiman: I know. We were all thrilled. We literally were dancing with joy that we figured that one out.\nWas there anything you used as a reference in terms of great patter songs that you wanted to keep in mind as you were writing?\nBenj Pasek: I'm sure lingering all of our heads is “Modern Major General” in some way. I don't know that you can ever escape it, just because it looms large in the pantheon of great patter songs.\nScott Wittman: I'd say Gilbert and Sullivan.\nBenj Pasek: Gilbert and Sullivan or some Lerner and Loewe stuff. I don't know; I think we didn't reference anything directly. I think we all love classic Broadway show tunes as well, so just having a really similar pool of references to draw, even if we didn’t name them… We sort of all identified the same kind of style that we thought it should be in.\nMarc Shaiman: And Scott and I were often told, \"That song is too wordy.\" We do like writing wordy songs. Sometimes, on some shows, we've even been told, \"It's so wordy that the audience will tune out.\" In this case, it was nice to be encouraged to embrace it.\nBenj Pasek: And the moment that was engineered was really about paying attention to the lyric. What was so great about how John and the writers set up the song was that the audience is really invested in, “Can he say these lyrics?” So, it's not something where you're distracted by other stage pictures that are going on, or other things that are happening that are going to detract. It allowed us to put as much dexterity and complicated internal rhyme as possible because the audience's only job, really, is to follow whether or not Charles-Hayden Savage can actually nail the patter song. It really allowed us to maximize that element of it.\nScott Wittman: It created an earworm long before they actually heard it, so that's sort of fun too. I think that the audience enjoyed that.\nMarc Shaiman: And then there’s Steve's performance. I was there that day and had to leave because they kept pushing it back. I couldn't believe I had sat there all day [only to have to leave], but that's typical on a movie or TV. So, I only saw him for the first time in that full version that they put out online. He's just so adorable. It was just a thrill.\nJustin Paul: I wasn't able to be there either. I remember texting with some of the music team, and they were like, \"I don't know what we're going to do, because we're only going to have maybe two hours to get this whole thing.\" Of all the songs in the season, it was intentionally the most challenging of all of the songs [and] of all the moments, and so we were like, \"How are we going to shortchange this?\" But it wasn't shortchanged.\nAt least [for] the folks on the music team, no one had ever seen him perform it. No one had seen him do what he was going to do, so everything that he broke out, all these crazy hand motions and his entire iteration of that song and that performance… I don't think anyone had ever seen before. That's just what he did on the day when cameras were rolling. It is… I say this about the performance, not the song: his performance is iconic. It really is.\nScott Wittman: I was there. He attacked it straight on. It was all in one take too, most of it.\nI love the way that it's presented in the show. It’s played in full and then there are these shots of everyone else trying to solve the murder as [the song is] happening. Did you know that it was going to be presented in that way, and from start to finish? Because I feel like that is rare even in shows that feature musicals; usually there are cut points and things like that.\nScott Wittman: It’s hard to cut away from that song though, because you'd lose the engine. It would stall on the track.\nMarc Shaiman: It was just pleasing to see, \"Oh my god, it's all in there.\" Because yeah, we are used to [projects where] eventually something gets cut or lost. It was also great that they did it as it is on the episode with all the other things going on. Nowadays it's so great that they can also present just him, so that there are these two versions to take in. It's very satisfying.\nScott Wittman: On Smash, we used to learn that if we kept changing keys, they couldn't cut.\nIt doesn't necessarily sound like it, but Steve Martin is such an accomplished musician as well. Did he have any input or suggestions with this at all?\nMarc Shaiman: No. He never said anything like, \"Could that be a C# minor instead of this?\" or anything like that. I think he felt it was enough to just learn the song and be able to perform it. And then we had the evil Ian co-producing the vocal. I never saw anything like Ian--never. I thought I’m something when I'm working with a singer, [like], “Try it again. Try it this way,” knowing that you can comp a vocal and take the best of this and that, but I never saw anything like this. But Steve Martin was incredibly patient and would just try anything any of us suggested. He was like, \"No, no, no. Give me a line reading. Sing it to me the way you think.\" And he would just try it, like, eight different ways. It was phenomenal. He's Steve Martin.\nWho orchestrated this? Because the orchestration is beautiful.\nJustin Paul: The orchestrator was an incredibly talented fellow named August Eriksmoen, who we've worked with before. What's great about August is that his style diversity is really off the chart. Even in our own work, he's done some more contemporary stuff and he's done a lot of classic Broadway kind of stuff, so his abilities really run the gamut. The first time that I saw this chart, I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be [great.]\"\nHe was like, \"Can I go there?\" and we're like, \"Yes, you have to go there.\" We’re so grateful that the show, the network, the studio, [and] everybody really committed to, “We want to make this feel like a big Broadway musical.” You watch on screen and [there’s] that set that they built at United Palace, [we had] an orchestra that was a really nice-sized orchestra record, and got the proper time to do it. It was onscreen an ode to Broadway, and a love letter to Broadway, but offscreen it was as well, from getting Broadway songwriters, to orchestrator, to the orchestra, to doing it the right way. It felt really beautiful that there was such a love and respect for how things get done on Broadway.\nSeason three of “Only Murders in the Building” finds Charles, Oliver & Mabel (played by Steve Martin, Martin Short & Selena Gomez) investigating a murder behind the scenes of a Broadway show. Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd) is a Hollywood action star whose Broadway debut is cut short by his untimely death.

Australian Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 20:00:27", "text": "Love Is in the Air shows off the beautiful locations where the Australian rom-com was filmed, which works particularly well for a movie about a pilot.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Love Is in the Air.\nNetflix’s Love Is in the Air features breathtaking views of quaint seaside towns and unspoiled naturalistic beauties, raising questions about the existence of the places mentioned in the Australian rom-com, as well as their filming locations. Debuting in the Top 10 most-watched movies on Netflix in many countries, including the U.S., Love Is in the Air follows chief pilot Dana (Delta Goodrem) as she deals with William (Joshua Sasse), ITCM Financial’s advisor from the UK. William ventures to Fullerton in a bid to shut Dana’s family company down. However, seeing the work Dana, Jeff (Roy Billing), and Nikki (Steph Tisdell) do on the ground serving remote communities changes William’s heart.\nJoining the list of Netflix’s best romantic comedy movies, Love Is in the Air makes perfect use of its filming locations, which manage to highlight just how remote the featured islands are. This is precisely why Dana prioritizes air deliveries to remote communities over tours for paying visitors. Love Is in the Air mentions multiple locations, including the quaint town of Fullterton, where Dana and her family live, and various spots like Packers Bay, or Lizard Island. While the filming locations are relatively close to each other and all in the state of Queensland, Australia, the places Love Is in the Air mentions are mostly fictional.\nThe company at the center of Love Is in the Air's story is Fullerton Airways, which according to the Australian rom-com, is based at Fullerton Airport. However, no airport with this name exists in the Whitsunday archipelago, where Love Is in the Air was filmed. Apart from multiple trips around the Whitsundays, Fullerton Airport is the main stage where most of the action happens in Love Is in the Air, making it an important location. It works as an airstrip and also as an accommodation, as it's where William ends up during his stay in Fullerton. He enjoys a front row seat to the comings and goings of the airport.\nRelated: 20 Best Australian TV Shows On US Netflix\nLove Is in the Air’s scenes at the airport were filmed at Whitsunday Airport (Shute Harbour) in Queensland, Australia (via Atlas of Wonders). The private airport boasts a modern hangar, a couple of helicopters, and, just like in Love Is in the Air, a residential area for small aircraft owners. Love Is in the Air makes a point of highlighting how everything is close in Fullerton, and Heath’s bar is where Nikki, Jeff, and Dana all hang out. It's also where William picks up the keys to his apartment. The bar exists in real life under the name The Hangar Cafe and Bar, and it’s mere meters from the runway.\nJeff makes a point of asking Dana to pick up William and show him the panoramic route as he tries to sort out the company’s books. The town of Fullerton's real name can be seen right after Dana welcomes William in her car. Airlie Beach, west of the Whitsunday Airport, doubles as Fullerton in Love Is in the Air. Nestled in Pioneer Bay, Airlie Beach offers the perfect arrival spot for visitors of the Whitsunday Islands, which boast naturalistic wilderness both on the ground and the sea, given their vicinity to the Great Barrier Reef.\nOn their many visits to remote communities, Dana and William see beautiful white sand beaches from above, and while they rarely specify the places they’re flying over, their flight right before the cyclone shows one of the beaches deemed among the most beautiful in the world. The northern side of Whitehaven Beach on Whitsunday Island can be seen on Dana and William’s flight back to Fullerton Airport. The beach, situated on the largest island of the archipelago, stretches over seven kilometers and can be reached by boat or overseen via helicopters and small aircraft flights (via Queensland’s official website).\nRelated: 25 Best Underrated Netflix Comedies\nLove Is in the Air’s end credits offer another shot of Whitsunday Island as Dana flies over it after the group overcomes the challenges Duncan Mitchell throws at them. The beautiful silica sand can be seen among the island’s green hills with the ocean in the background. With the small-town community being at the center of Love Is in the Air, the Whitsunday Islands offer the perfect backdrop for the Australian romantic comedy, showing off the archipelago’s astounding natural beauty and simultaneously explaining why would William be enticed to stay.\nSource: Atlas of Wonders, Queensland.com\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Female Anime Anti-Heroes", "date": "2023-10-02 20:00:27", "text": "Anti-heroines can be popular in an too, proving that there is more than one way to lead a story. They don't need anyone's approval to live their life.\nFemale anime anti-heroes are a surprisingly underrepresented archetype, due to the medium's tendency to turn female characters into helpless damsels in distress, often needing to be saved by their strong male counterparts. Even when that is not the case, they are often either given supporting roles, or act as the love interest of the main character, rather than having their own identity.\nAnime anti-heroes, in general, are not entirely uncommon, but most of them are men, who are typically allowed to have stronger and more dominant personalities, without needing to be considerate of those around them. Regardless, there are also female leading characters who are shown to go around the world as they see fit, without conforming to any rules, and making a name for themselves as some of the best anti-heroines.\nBlack Lagoon's titular Lagoon Company is a group of people typically working for criminal organizations, providing services such as smuggling and piracy. Revy's personality seems perfectly suitable for her line of work, as she is known for being rude, aggressive, and sadistic, often using foul language and killing without any hesitation. However, this destructive behavior is actually fueled by her deep psychological trauma, as she was verbally, physically, and even sexually abused by people who were supposed to protect her. This caused her to desperately seek power, and being impoverished resulted in her obsession with money. However, Revy also seems to have a soft side, occasionally saving her comrades.\nAs the female protagonist of The Future Diary, Yuno Gasai's identity and actions revolve around her love interest, Yukiteru Amano. Despite genuinely caring for Yukiteru and doing everything in her power to ensure his success in the survival game they're playing, her methods tend to be on the questionable side. Many of her problems stem from her childhood; after being adopted into a seemingly happy family, her father ended up being mostly absent, and her mother turned out to be abusive towards her, even locking her in a cage. This caused Yuno to become troubled and develop a twisted personality, often resorting to cruel and violent methods.\nRelated: Future Diary: The Main Characters, Ranked From Worst To Best By Character Arc\nAkame Ga Kill's eponymous anti-heroine, Akame, is a ruthless assassin who kills her enemies without showing any mercy or remorse. However, she is not entirely villainous, as she is shown to care deeply about her comrades, always trying to protect her friends and being affected when she is unable to do so. Her seemingly cold and emotionless nature is a result of her childhood, during which she, along with her sister, was sold to the Empire and forced into a cruel exam. The survivors were then trained by elite assassins to become effective killers, learning killing and espionage techniques, and undergoing difficult training.\nAs the protagonist of the Slayers franchise, Lina Inverse's actions are typically not too different from those of other heroic mages, as she too tends to spend most of her time fighting the forces of evil. What differentiates her from her peers, however, would be her methods; she has a short temper and a tendency to cause great collateral damage when fighting, using black magic derived from beings of chaos, with no regard or consideration for her surroundings. Moreover, coming from a family of merchants, she is always trying to get a good bargain, even forcing people to give her items for free occasionally.\nGunslinger Girl revolves around the Social Welfare Agency, where young girls are given cybernetic implants and used as anti-terrorist agents, working alongside \"Handlers\" who brainwash them into being completely loyal, often at the cost of their memories. Triela became one of the Agency's first cyborgs after living a tragic life as a victim of the mob, routinely drugged and abused, and nearly dying at some point. She is shown to be one of the more compassionate and level-headed characters, often teaching and helping the other girls who are struggling. Though she is seen as an anti-hero because of how brutal she can be, Triela is but a product of her circumstances.\nKoko Hekmatyar is an arms dealer, typically seen traveling with her squad of bodyguards around the world to conduct business. Her personality is difficult to assess, as she rarely shows her true feelings. Her behavior is occasionally immature, but she can also be composed, especially when dealing with business partners. One thing that can be said for sure is that she is determined, as she is leading a secret project known as Jormungand, with the goal of ending war and arms trade. This plan may involve casualties amounting to 700,000 people, but she sees that as a necessary sacrifice, which deserves to be made for the sake of achieving world peace.\nBorn into a family of demon hunters, Shiki Ryougi grew up with two personalities, the stoic and cynical female persona, and the male persona who knows nothing but to kill. After being involved in an accident that leaves her in a 2-year coma however, she realizes that she lost her male persona SHIKI, instead gaining the \"Mystic Eyes of Death Perception\", a supernatural ability that lets her perceive the death of any object or being. The Garden of Sinners follows Shiki's life and the mysteries she is wrapped up in, making no effort to hide just how cruel and merciless she can be when she wants to.\nElfen Lied's protagonist Kaede is a Diclonius, a species with horns and psychokinetic abilities, defined by one of anime's most tragic backstories. Raised in an orphanage, she grew up with the mistaken idea that her parents abandoned her and wanted her dead, causing her deep psychological issues. At the orphanage, she was not only neglected by the staff but also bullied by the other kids. As she matured, her vectors, or invisible telekinetic arms, also developed, and she unconsciously used them to murder people when she felt betrayed and enraged multiple times. Once she learns about love though, she makes the conscious decision to change and atone for her past.\nClare is a Claymore, or human-Yoma hybrid, fighting the demonic creatures called Yoma that torment the lands. Although she can be considered an anti-hero because of her generally cold and blunt attitude, seemingly prioritizing the elimination of Yoma above all else, including the protection of other humans, she proves herself to be rather kind beyond the surface, genuinely caring about her friends and comrades. Unfortunately, she has trouble expressing her feelings due to her traumatic past. After losing her parents to Yoma and being captured and abused by one, she was finally saved by another Claymore, namely Teresa, only to eventually lose her too, left with nothing but a desire for revenge.\nMichiko Malandro, Michiko & Hatchin's co-protagonist, is a strong woman with a troubled past. Growing up in an orphanage, she routinely stole from shops to provide for the other younger kids, feeling responsible for them. After leaving the orphanage, she eventually got arrested, later escaping prison to look for the daughter of her ex-lover, Hiroshi. Saving Hana, whom she would then name Hatchin, from an abusive foster family, the two set out on a journey together. Michiko may have strange ways of showing it, often appearing as abrasive or a troublemaker, not afraid of pointing guns at people, but she truly cares for the ones she loves, trusting them completely.\nThese anti-heroines prove that strong anime female protagonists can be popular too, despite not being particularly common. In fact, their rarity only makes them that more special. Rather than being dismissive or blindly following the expectations associated with the role of a leading character, they prove that there is more than one way to lead a story and set the tone of the action. That's what makes these female anime anti-heroes some of the coolest and most memorable anime characters ever.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section. He discovered his passion for the medium as a child, watching shows like Death Note on late-night TV, and has been enthralled with it ever since.

{"title": "Every Pumpkinhead Movie, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-02 19:50:28", "text": "While each of the Pumpkinhead films has its charms, the monster movie franchise's horror outings do differ in terms of quality and watchability.\nWhile the Pumpkinhead film franchise features a terrifying horror villain, not all the sequels are as interesting as their title character, making some of the movies stand out as better than others. Special effects legend Stan Winston made his directorial debut in 1988 with the supernatural horror movie Pumpkinhead. The original movie and the three sequels comprise this underrated horror movie franchise follow the story of the titular demon, a monstrous figure summoned by a grieving father. Pumpkinhead’s antihero wants revenge on teens who killed his son in a hit-and-run but regrets summoning the beast when he sees the bloody chaos that Pumpkinhead can wreak.\nA possible Pumpkinhead remake has been rumored for years, but it still hasn’t happened. As a result, there are currently only four installments in the Pumpkinhead franchise that wavered in quality. The first movie was released in 1988 and proved a minor box office flop, grossing only $4.5 million on a budget of $3 million. Despite its lack of success in theaters plus some weak reviews, Pumpkinhead gained a sequel six years later in the form of Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings. Like its titular monster, the franchise then lay dormant. In 2006, the belated sequel Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes continued its story, while 2007’s Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud ended the series.\nRelated: 10 Movie Monsters From The 80s Ranked By Toughness\nIt is hard to fault the 2007 TV movie Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud for ambition. Rather than phoning it in and offering another simplistic revenge story that copies the beats of the original movie, this fourquel instead opted to incorporate the real-life Hatfield and McCoy feud into the Pumpkinhead series. However, like the later installments of the Alien franchise whose eponymous monsters Stan Winston also helped design, Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud fell apart as its sprawling story got too big for its own good. The battle between the families is engaging and Pumpkinhead looks great, but the connective tissue just isn’t there.\nAs a result, Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud is effectively two passable movies that only occasionally intersect and become something good. One is a grisly Western tragedy about star-crossed lovers from feuding families while the other is a gruesome supernatural horror movie that wants to showcase its famous monster. There are some memorable kills in Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud, which proves that even the weakest outings of the franchise have something to offer. Lance Henriksen’s Ed Harley also shows up for a cameo, although his role is far smaller than it was in 2006’s Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes. Thanks to a downbeat ending, this is the least essential of the series.\nLike the Child’s Play movies, another slasher franchise that survived from the late ‘80s into the ‘90s, the Pumpkinhead movies didn’t prioritize their villain’s backstory until the sequels started. In Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings, Pumpkinhead gains a deformed son in the sweet Tommy, who is swiftly killed off by some of the most monstrous bullies in movie history. While it is undeniably satisfying to see these villains get torn to shreds when Tommy is revived in the form of Pumpkinhead, the unrelenting bleakness of Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings makes this sequel a tough watch.\nThe sequel’s antagonists are so inhumane that it is tough to care about their fates, making this a lesser entry in the series. Fortunately, some creative kills ensure this isn’t a complete waste of time. While other direct-to-video horror sequels feature innumerable sequels that fail to justify their existence, the trim runtime of Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings and its nasty gore make the movie worth a watch. However, the rest of the series has stronger character work.\nBy rights, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes should have been a disaster. For one thing, it is a made-for-television sequel released around the same time as cheap, in-name-only cash-ins like Lake Placid 2. For another, its director, Jake West, was previously best known for low-budget British horror comedies. Despite these limitations, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes is a gory joy. Not only does the original movie’s Lance Henriksen return as Ed Harley, but he is also joined by horror royalty Ed Bradley. The Hellraiser franchise villain plays a bizarre anti-villain in the form of Doc Fraser, an amoral mortician who is caught harvesting the organs of the dead.\nUnfortunately for Fraser, he made the mistake of carrying out his crimes in the same small town where the original Pumpkinhead hero Ed Harley once lived. Soon enough, Harley is revived as Pumpkinhead and the original movie’s hero becomes the killer in this sequel. Since Fraser has to go on a bloody murder spree of his own to cover his tracks, this sequel is an unusually morally ambiguous spin on the franchise’s simple plotting. Fraser is no one’s hero, and Harley’s take on Pumpkinhead is comparatively morally justified in his actions, making the story of Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes a gory fun time that also plays with the franchise’s formula.\nThe original Pumpkinhead is by no means perfect, but it is still the strongest horror movie in the series so far. Lance Henriksen gives a stellar central performance as a grieving father who will go to any lengths to avenge his son’s death, and the tragedy of his loss means that Pumpkinhead’s slow-burn revenge story feels earned. In many ways, the opening half of Pumpkinhead plays out like a more vengeful spin on Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, as a parent’s grief drives them to unimaginable extremes. However, once the kills start, the franchise’s real selling point becomes obvious.\nWhile every sequel gives Pumpkinhead plenty of screen time, the monster is never more effective than he is in his big-screen debut. Pumpkinhead builds up to its big reveal slowly and, when Stan Winston’s creature is finally unveiled, the movie has the confidence to show off the beast in numerous lengthy set-pieces. Where many horror movies shy away from this approach, the original Pumpkinhead proves that a great monster can withstand plenty of time terrorizing viewers onscreen without diluting its scare factor. As a result, Pumpkinhead remains the best film in the franchise to date thanks to its unique combination of tragic horror drama and pure monster movie chills.\n"}

Paul Rudd debuted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Scott Lang in 2015's Ant-Man, with the movie revealing that Scott was a thief before he became one of the MCU's most beloved heroes. By the time Ant-Man's post-credits scene teased Captain America: Civil War, Scott had already fully become a hero; however, Ant-Man showed that Scott's criminal ties were very much alive at the start of the film, with Rudd's character trying to rob Hank Pym's house.\nInsider showed safe technician Charlie Santore Ant-Man's heist scene, letting the expert give his review of 2015's Ant-Man.\nSantore was not very impressed with Scott Lang's heist sequence in the MCU movie, with the real-life safecracker pointing out several flaws in Ant-Man's depiction of how Scott got into Hank Pym's vault. According to the specialist, the movie's errors include Scott taking a fingerprint off a door with the use of tape and the character freezing the vault door to crack it apart. As Ant-Man used a real safecracking tool — the StrongArm MiniRig — Santore rated the scene a 3/10. Check out the full quote below:\n\"He's taken the fingerprint off the door with tape. It could have been the cleaning lady's print that he pulled off of there. This actually broke my head a little bit. If you pull the print off with tape, and you turn it over and put a ring on it, and put Loctite in it aren't you actually making it a cast of the invert of the fingerprint?\nCarbondale's a made-up name, but the vault door itself, I looked through hundreds and hundreds of photos of vault doors, and I'm pretty certain that the art directors based this off a very early Diebold vault door. This is actually a real tool. This is a StrongArm MiniRig that's used for putting pressure when one's drilling. So that aspect of it is definitely accurate. We'll go do a quick job that winds up being something where you don't have your full tool kit with you. So there's lots of times when we've been running around trying to bend wires and make tools and sort of have to come up with something that we didn't have with us.\nSupposedly he's freezing it, and it's going to expand and crack this door apart. What they showed us was the bolt work inside of the safe and the door pan. There's a big door pan. If he poured a gallon of water in there, it would spill out the bottom of the door pan, basically. If by chance he froze it and the ice expanded, I mean, obviously water can expand. Glaciers expand over time. The thing about a vault door is, in this case, there's a thin back panel that's like sheet metal essentially on the back of the door. So the idea that that's going to expand is pure fantasy. It would blow the back of the panel off before it blew the door off.\nI opened up a couple of safes that were at a Blockbuster Video a while and there was Astroglide, condoms, and some dirty photos. So I don't know if a manager was having a fling with somebody, but that was pretty unexpected. On the more valuable side of things, we once opened a safe in an affluent part of Beverly Hills that people had recently moved into a home. The former owner was gone. There were Bulgari necklaces, Cartier necklaces, Krugerrands, GIA certificates. I mean, I can only imagine that it must have been a mid-to-high-six-figure lick. But I think that people get traumatized when there's that much left because they're not expecting to have a moral conflict, sort of. You know, 'It's technically mine, but this obviously meant a great deal to whoever it was that was living here before.'\nIt's nonsense, but the MiniRig is real. So I'm going to give it a 3 [Rating out of 10].\"\nRelated: Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best\nScott Lang would not be a good thief in real life, as per Santore's review of Ant-Man's heist sequence. However, the character was a very good thief in the MCU. Scott found success in many of his heists, including one at the Avengers Compound in Ant-Man. While the character was a convicted thief before Pym selected him to don his Ant-Man suit and become the new bearer of the Ant-Man mantle, that doesn't mean that Scott only failed in his criminal life.\nScott has been shown to be a smart character, making him a master thief, as Rudd's hero has a great mixture of athletic abilities, as well as knowledge of chemistry and hacking, which help him pull off heists. However, Scott got caught when trying to rob Hank Pym's home, though that ultimately led to him becoming a reformed hero. While Scott has failed as a thief a few times in the MCU, that does not mean that can't be successful if there are high stakes involved.\nThat is why Kang the Conqueror made Scott steal his Multiversal Engine Core back in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, knowing that the hero would deliver if his daughter's life was at risk. Scott was successful, showing that he can be a good thief when needed. Thankfully, his life has taken a turn away from his criminal past, with Scott now being a beloved Avenger — even being chosen to write a book about the events of Avengers: Endgame — and founding X-Con Security Consultants, which sees Scott move away from his past as a thief to now spearhead a security company, showing his growth since the first Ant-Man.\nSource: Insider\n"}
{"title": "Hughie & The Boys Are The Show's Real Villains After Gen V's Most Tragic Story", "date": "2023-10-02 19:40:28", "text": "Gen V’s most tragic story highlights the impact of Hughie Campbell and The Boys’ actions, suggesting they could be the show’s real villains.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nGen V focuses on young Supes aspiring to be heroes, and its most tragic story highlights how Hughie Campbell and his companions could be the real villains of The Boys. So far, Gen V is doing a great job of expanding The Boys universe. However, it may also prove that the main show's heroes aren't as heroic as they seem. While it's pretty obvious that the actions of Billy Butcher and even Hughie fall into morally gray territory, they're still portrayed as the good guys trying to take down Vought International and Homelander.\nIn their efforts to rid the world of Supe corruption, the main group that goes by \"The Boys\" manages to kill the likes of Translucent and even unravel The Seven. Taking on Homelander is a task too difficult, even with the help of Compound V, but they do succeed in exposing his true colors to the public. Their methods aren't always ethical, even if The Boys are usually trying to do the right thing. And Gen V doesn't necessarily suggest otherwise. However, it shows the fallout of the group exposing how Compound V works, and it's pretty catastrophic for Gen V's young Supes.\nIn The Boys season 2, Hughie and Starlight manage to leak Compound V to the press, letting the whole world know how it works. Their revelation is made much darker through the lens of Gen V. In The Boys, exposing Vought's secret about how Supes are made is seen as a huge victory. The team gives away Vought's biggest secret: that their Supes' abilities come from this chemical. The company works with parents to give the serum to children. The Boys' Gen V spinoff shows how kids react to their parents allowing them to be injected — and it has a detrimental effect on some of them.\nRELATED: Gen V's Surprise The Boys Cameo Secretly Confirms A Major Hughie Theory\nGen V's Godolkin University grants aspiring Supes the chance to perfect their powers, but despite its tagline, it's not a safe place to do so. The Godolkin Dean reveals there were barely any suicides after the Hughie and Starlight's revelation, disregarding the few that occurred as nothing serious. While this may not be a big deal to the Dean, the leak was clearly so traumatic to some students that they took their own lives. Golden Boy's brother, Sam, also struggles with this now-public secret, which may have contributed to him ending up in the Woods. Revealing the truth about Compound V may have hurt Vought, but it also hurt kids.\nHughie and Starlight make the decision to expose the secret of Compound V in The Boys, but it arguably isn't their place to do so. It's important for people to know the truth, as it shows that Vought is exploiting children to have them become heroes. However, it also reveals that parents consented to this. Making this public knowledge was always going to have consequences. When all the Supe kids learn that their parents lied to them, they deal with emotional trauma. The degree of this is explored in Gen V, which starts to paint Hughie and The Boys as villains.\nRELATED: The Boys Season 3 Finally Resolved 1 Annoying Hughie Storyline\nFor some people, knowing the truth may be a good thing, but for others, it completely destroys their lives. Sam is the most obvious example of this. Given how much Starlight resents her own mother after finding out the truth, she perhaps should have taken more caution before going public. Starlight's reaction to Hughie taking Compound V also makes them grow further apart and damages their relationship, showing the impact the drug has even among The Boys.\nThe Boys never shies away from showing the consequences of the characters' actions. One of the most notorious examples is Supersonic's death. Starlight warns him about Homelander's true nature and even tries to get the other Supe involved in taking down The Seven's lead. To teach Starlight a lesson, Homelander delivers Supersonic a brutal death. This incident makes it clear that The Boys won't let even its most heroic characters off the hook. Therefore, The Boys season 4 must show the impact of the characters' actions surrounding Compound V, much like Gen V is already doing.\nWhether it is through a crossover with Gen V's characters or by publicly revealing the impact of Hughie and Starlight's announcement, The Boys' protagonists must see the impact of what they've done. The realization that they've hurt young Supes would likely upset Starlight and Hughie, perhaps making them rethink their battle with Vought — or maybe making them double down on stopping those responsible. There will be plenty of twists in The Boys season 4, and the addition of Gen V makes things even more unpredictable. How much the show leans into the main group being the villains is unknown, but The Boys must face the consequences of their actions.\nBackground\n\nBorn in Glasgow Scotland, Kyle is a passionate journalist who has a keen interest in TV and film.

Released in 2010, Nolan's mind-bending thriller stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, a thief who uses dream-sharing technology to undertake a mission that will finally reunite him with his children. Murphy stars in the movie as Robert Fischer, Cobb's target, with the project serving as the third time Murphy and Nolan have collaborated.\nIn a recent interview with BBC Radio 1, Murphy takes a look back at the big movies of his career, reflecting on one memorable Inception filming experience.\nAs the actor recalls, he filmed one of his most involved and important scenes on the first day, which included a tilting set. Check out Murphy's full comment below:\n\n“I remember that day was my first day on set. It was this big scene with Leo, biggest movie star in the world, someone I have huge admiration for. I walked on and that whole bar had been built on a huge gimbal in order to get the effect of the glass tilting. The whole thing, this huge set, just went like that [tilts hands]. And there were all these stuntmen. I knew I was making a serious movie there.”\n\n“I remember that day was my first day on set.

And there were all these stuntmen. I knew I was making a serious movie there.”\nRelatively early on his career, Nolan became known as a filmmaker who highly valued practical effects and a more old-school style of filmmaking. The director's love of practical action is on clear display in his Dark Knight trilogy, and has only become more legendary with each passing film. Oppenheimer, his latest release, even recreates a nuclear explosion with no CGI, with practical elements layered with VFX to create the blast.\nNolan takes this same approach with Inception, with much of the film's action standing the test of time because of the more old-school way in which it was captured. While certain sequences in the film do rely on VFX, many are impressively real, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's hallway fight, for example, being filmed inside a constructed hallway that could rotate 360 degrees.\nThe practical action in the movie compliments a genuinely novel idea, with the notion of a dream heist being something that is truly original. That's not to mention the fact that Inception's ending scene is deliciously ambiguous, generating conversations and theories that persist to this day. While Inception has ebbed and flowed in terms of its position in Nolan's larger filmography, the film remains a testament to the director's vision and talent, and Murphy's latest recollection further speaks to the impact the filmmaker's approach has on the actors involved.\nSource: BBC Radio 1/ YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Wes Anderson's Poison: How Venomous The Krait Snake Really Is", "date": "2023-10-02 19:33:24", "text": "A deadly krait snake is at the heart of Wes Anderson's film Poison, but how big a threat would it actually pose to Benedict Cumberbatch's Harry?\nIn Wes Anderson's short movie Poison, Benedict Cumberbatch finds himself in hot water due to a venomous krait snake coiled on his stomach ― but it's unclear if the venomous reptile really spells a death sentence. Poison is the final Dahl adaptation in Wes Anderson's short Netflix film series, and the others in the series featured Dahl's characteristic dramatic claims, both fanciful and nasty; for instance, licorice being made out of rats' blood in The Rat Catcher. While Anderson's Poison features a real type of snake, its danger might not match reality.\nCumberbatch's Poison character Harry Pope, a British man in colonial India, begins the movie trapped in bed, telling his friend Woods (Dev Patel) he has been lying entirely still for \"hours and hours\" so as not to wake the krait asleep on him. Woods is immediately alarmed, jumping backward, and rescuer Dr. Ganderbai (Ben Kingsley) also sees the situation as very grave, even confessing the snake bite serum he has might not save Harry's life. It's clear in the extreme tension between the men, and particularly in Harry's sweaty state of panic, that in the movie kraits are notorious for being extremely dangerous.\nPoison's Harry, Woods, and Ganderbai are right to be worried. Krait bites kill an estimated 70-80% of untreated victims in Bangladesh, the now-independent nation where Anderson's movie is hinted to be set thanks to the trademark jute crops on screen. Kraits live in rural Asia and can bite when startled or threatened. In Bangladesh, the common krait is \"responsible for more than half of all snakebite deaths,\" reports the journal Toxicon: X in the National Library of Medicine. It continues that victims experience pain and paralysis, with death occurring between four and eight hours after the bite:\nSnake biting is a major public health concern in Bangladesh... The common krait (B. caeruleus) is one of the 'big four' snake's species and it has been responsible for one of the most human deaths and injuries from snakebites in Bangladesh and India. Typically, victims report acute stomach pains that worsen over time, followed by gradual paralysis.\nThe Wes Anderson movie's description of kraits is fairly accurate, then. Dr. Ganderbai warns his serum might not save Harry, and antivenom has limited effect in reality, too ― though this is more because it is often administered much too late, owing to victims in rural areas being without easy hospital access. The journal warns that once paralysis has set in, the situation is \"catastrophic\" no matter the treatment. It makes sense that Dahl would know to take kraits' danger seriously, as he trained as a World War II fighter pilot in Iraq, which borders Iran, one of the nations where the snakes live.\nWhile krait snakes really are very dangerous, Poison's ending focuses on another kind of venom altogether. The reptile, whether it was ever really there or wholly imagined, is not the real source of the Netflix film's titular poison. That's actually Harry himself, with the film's toxicity embedded in his racism, attitude of superiority, and interactions with Dr. Ganderbai. Harry keeps his racism coiled like the creature he thinks is on his stomach, acting irritable and dismissive but under control, until a moment of tension so unbearable that it springs out of him — with a snake-like rattling even heard on screen.\nHarry's racist tirade against Ganderbai is not only a betrayal, but also shows viewers that the anxious tension that infuses the men's interactions throughout the short movie isn't merely around the snake, but about power. Harry feels \"superior\" to Ganderbai but is suddenly not in control, trapped in bed and feeling threatened and cornered. The unseen snake is a phantom that haunts the men's interactions, like the racial dynamics of colonial India. Woods apologizes to Ganderbai at the end of the Wes Anderson film on Harry's behalf — but both he and Ganderbai know many more snakes are lying in wait to spring at them.\nSource: Toxicon: X\nJen is a British journalist who moved to Canada, mostly for the poutine.

While each Power Rangers season since the end of the Zordon Era has been mostly standalone, there is still a strong level of interconnectivity in the franchise. Even Dino Charge and Dino Super Charge, both of which take place in a different timeline from most Power Rangers TV shows, have been part of crossovers in the last few years. This includes Cosmic Fury, which featured three generations of Dino Rangers.\nThe Power Rangers Cosmic Fury cast included David Yost as Mighty Morphin’s Blue Ranger Billy, who fought alongside the former Dino Fury Rangers for most of the season. Heckyl’s return in Cosmic Fury made it into a crossover involving the Mighty Morphin, Dino Charge, and Dino Fury lores. In addition to being a fun crossover, Heckyl’s role in Cosmic Fury delivered on a seven-year-old Power Rangers tease – the debut of Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger.\nPower Rangers Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger never actually appeared on the show, even though Heckyl was clearly meant to become a Power Ranger. Heckyl is one of many Power Rangers villains who were later redeemed, which is something the character even acknowledges and jokes about in Cosmic Fury. Heckyl’s “classic redemption arc” in Dino Super Charge was not surprising considering that the character was not originally evil. Heckyl was the guardian of the Dark Energem from Sentai-6, but after the planet was invaded, he accidentally touched the artifact. Dino Charge’s Heckyl was given the power of the Dark Energem, but an evil alter ego was created in the process.\nRelated: Which Super Sentai Show Power Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Zords & Costumes Are Based On\nHeckyl’s Super Sentai counterpart becomes a Ranger in Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger: Gaburincho of Musicmovie, a film set in the same continuity as the Kyoryuger show. However, due to character rights issues, Power Rangers could not use the Deathryuger design in the TV show. This is why Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger, a character viewers dreamed of seeing in Power Rangers, was not in the show. However, whatever prevented Power Rangers from using the Deathryuger design was handled, and the Dark Ranger finally debuted in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger also appeared in the BOOM! Power Rangers comics, which are set in a different continuity entirely.\nHeckyl momentarily became the Blue Solar Ranger in the Power Rangers Beyond The Grid comic books, during which the Death Ranger design first appeared in a piece of Power Rangers media. The Power Rangers comics revealed that Heckyl returned to his homeworld to protect the Dark Energer but continued to struggle with its evil influence. While the Dark Ranger’s origin story in the comics was quite interesting and brought Heckyl’s Dino Charge story full circle, it cannot be assumed that those same events happened in the Power Rangers TV show chronology.\nPower Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Heckyl role was surprising, especially because Power Rangers Dino Charge takes place in an alternate universe from the main timeline. Cosmic Fury acknowledged that Heckyl was from another universe but did not get into detail as to how or why the Dark Ranger had come to this dimension. Regardless, Cosmic Fury’s Dark Ranger was an essential part of the Power Rangers’ plan to save Earth from an alien invasion led by Lord Zedd and his allies. Heckyl was Terrick’s spy inside Lord Zedd’s ship and became Squillia’s crush before revealing his true identity. Almost seven years after Dino Charge’s finale, Heckyl morphed into the Dark Ranger.\nRelated: Power Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Ending Explained: Is It The Last Power Ranger Season?\nThe Dark Ranger was supplying Terrick and the Resistance with information on Lord Zedd, but he was eventually captured. After the Power Rangers freed Heckyl and the others, the Dark Ranger briefly joined the Cosmic Fury team in one of the coolest Power Rangers battles in years. Heckyl’s Dark Ranger Morpher was unique compared to the ones from the Dino Charge Rangers, and his transformation sequence began with the “Unleash the power” battle cry. After fighting side by side with the Cosmic Fury Rangers and Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger Billy Cranston in episode 7, Heckyl continued to help the Resistance offscreen.\nRyan Carter plays Heckyl in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. Heckyl first appears in episode 6 as the spy inside Lord Zedd’s base before morphing into the Dark Ranger in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury episode 7. Ryan Carter originally played Heckyl in Power Rangers Dino Charge, having appeared in the final episode of the season. Carter would reprise his role as Heckyl in Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, which explored the character’s origins and his secret, evil form. Snide, Heckyl’s evil counterpart in Dino Charge, was voiced by a different actor, Campbell Cooley.\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 7.\nIvanna Sahkno's Shin Hati has quickly become a favorite among viewers of Ahsoka, especially as the dark Jedi apprentice of Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll. The duo has been shrouded in mystery since their orange lightsabers first appeared in the earliest previews of the Star Wars Disney+ TV show, and with each new episode, more about them has unraveled - especially for Shin. As someone craving the power only a high rank from Grand Admiral Thrawn could promise, Shin's desires have strayed from her master's, and now she's set on her own path. Shin's story has piqued the interest of many viewers, and for some, it's inspired some incredible creations.\nOne of these creations is a cosplay by Lucy of striking similarity to Shin, as captured by Tom Roberts. Lucy dons an incredibly faithful recreation of Shin's full outfit, including her silver pieces of armor.\nLucy invokes the energy of Sahkno as Shin in this photo, especially with the far-away glance of the potential of her future. From her hair to her boots, Lucy brings Shin's dark Jedi look of conflict to life with this cosplay.\nWith only the finale of Ahsoka season 1 remaining, Shin has one chance left to find redemption before the story's conclusion. Ahsoka has now offered that path to her, but whether Shin takes it or not is still left to be seen. It certainly seems as if she may take this route based on the abandonment of her master and her chemistry with Natasha Liu Bordizzo's Sabine, but with limited storytelling space remaining and plenty of loose threads left to tie up, it could be that Shin's redemption has to wait until season 2.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nShin is a character that should remain in the future of Star Wars stories. She's become one of the series' most interesting characters, and now that she seems to desire being at Thrawn's side, she could function as an important Force-sensitive adversary in the greater conflict Thrawn's return promises the galaxy. Should Shin take the path of redemption, then she could also become a key part of Luke's new Jedi Order, or at least join the effort to stop Thrawn. Either way, Shin has brought a lot of interest to Ahsoka, and hopefully her story will get to continue on in both galaxies.\nAhsoka releases new episodes Tuesdays at 6 pm PT / 9 pm ET on Disney+.\nSource: Tom Roberts\n"}
{"title": "10 Harsh Realities About The DCEU’s Ending", "date": "2023-10-02 19:30:29", "text": "The DCEU is finally coming to an end with the release of 2023's Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, but the franchise's final days haven't been positive.\nThe DC Extended Universe might be coming to an end, but the franchise's final days have caused huge division and created several problems for the upcoming reboot, the DC Universe. Warner Bros. kicked off the DCEU with the 2013 release of Man of Steel and quickly thrust their superhero franchise into overdrive, adapting the stories of some of DC Comics' most popular characters into live-action. Since its beginnings, however, the DCEU has always been polarizing, with the work of individual directors tending to be praised rather than the franchise's overarching storyline, visual effects, scripts, and even performances from several of the franchise's core cast.\nThis division, and the 2022 merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery Inc., led to a lengthy period of turmoil, with DC Films being replaced with DC Studios, with filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran hired as co-CEOs. Both Gunn and Safran have delivered strong superhero movies, so immediately set into motion a plan to reboot the DCEU, allowing the mistakes of the past to be glossed over with new stories. While the DC Universe is kicking off in 2024 with Creature Commandos and Waller, and with 2025's Superman: Legacy, the DCEU still needs to deliver its final project, though the faltering franchise has left a lot to be desired.\nThe DCEU will officially conclude on December 20, 2023, with the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. While 2018's Aquaman became a smash hit, grossing over $1 billion at the box office, predictions aren't as high for the sequel despite the majority of the primary cast returning. There has been confusion surrounding why Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the final DCEU film before the reboot, with many considering The Flash a better closing narrative before the DC Universe.\nXolo Maridueña will reprise his role of Jaime Reyes from 2023's Blue Beetle in the DC Universe, but despite being positively received, his DCEU debut still became a box office bomb due to its release date. Blue Beetle was released after several disappointing DC projects, and it may have been hard for audiences to get excited about a story in a soon-to-close shared universe. Had Blue Beetle been released a couple of years earlier or waited to debut as an official part of the new DC Universe, it almost assuredly would have fared better.\nBlue Beetle's disappointing turnout was a symptom of a greater issue with the DCEU's recent releases. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the performance of Wonder Woman 1984 and Gunn's own The Suicide Squad, but its successors didn't fare any better and have acted as the final nail in the DCEU's coffin. 2022's Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash in 2023 were all met with mixed-to-negative responses and only grossed $797.4 million collectively - a number several solo superhero movies have surpassed their own.\nIn the lead-up to The Flash's release, the film was billed to be resetting the DCEU, using DC Comics' Flashpoint storyline as inspiration, seemingly gifting the DC Universe the perfect jumping-off point. However, this failed to come to fruition. The Flash's DC franchise reset involving George Clooney's Bruce Wayne made no sense, it's timeline and storyline were confusing, and the film's poor visual effects and script quality didn't do it any favors. DC Studios had the perfect opportunity to set the stage for a major reshuffle in their live-action franchise with The Flash, but completely fumbled it, leading to more confusion.\nThe DCEU has left many unanswered questions in almost every project, and with the franchise now coming to an end, these loose ends will never be resolved. Part of the magic of a shared franchise is that each project can set up something for the future, but the DCEU's constantly-changing plans and confusing timelines mean that too many storylines were set up. Viewers will never know what happened to Robin, what Bruce Wayne's Knightmare visions would have culminated in, what happened when Superman met Black Adam, or whether Shazam joined the Justice Society.\nRebooting the DCEU seems like the easy way to avoid past mistakes leaking into the new DC Universe, as history could repeat itself once David Corenswet brings a different version of Clark Kent to life in the DCU's Superman: Legacy. However, after a lengthy period of DC releasing disappointing projects, the future won't only entail focusing on a reboot but also trying to rebuild audience trust in the franchise. Many have become apathetic towards the DCEU, as proven by the turnout to Blue Beetle, The Flash, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods, so Gunn and Safran must try and build a strong foundation to reignite desire in the new franchise.\nPerhaps one of the key elements that led to the downfall of the DCEU was that Warner Bros. was in constant competition with Marvel Studios' more successful Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starting with 2008's Iron Man, the MCU now comprises over forty projects across film, TV, and animation. In only a decade, DC released 14 feature films (including Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom) and one TV series, paling in comparison. Jumping too fast into crossover stories meant that individual characters never saw the development they needed, and this was proven by 2023's Blue Beetle, which was more positively received thanks to its overt separation from the wider world of the DCEU.\nAs well as leaving many loose ends and producing several disappointing installments, the DCEU also missed several perfect opportunities to make itself stronger. For instance, Henry Cavill's Superman was wasted, despite many calling for a direct sequel to 2013's Man of Steel, and Ben Affleck's Batman never got the development he deserved, missing out on a much-needed solo project. Perhaps the franchise would have been more popular had Zack Snyder been able to complete his planned Justice League storyline, but even this can't be known for sure. Too many stories and developmental moments slipped through the net, leading to the poor projects that have been released more recently.\nDespite rebooting the DCEU into the new DC Universe, Gunn and Safran have confirmed several DCEU characters who will return in the DCU. While it will surely be great to see John Cena's Peacemaker, Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, Xolo Maridueña's Blue Beetle, and others returning, the fact that some actors will continue to play their roles while others are being recast has led to confusion among DC's audiences. Gunn has stressed that the DC Universe's first projects will mark a new canon, suggesting the entire DCEU will be forgotten, so actors will be playing new versions of the same characters, but this may be difficult for DC fans to comprehend.\nIt has also become evident that the DCEU has wasted some of DC Comics' most popular properties. Henry Cavill's Superman was insignificant in the DCEU, and Ben Affleck's Batman was underdeveloped and never got his solo movie. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was one of the DCEU's most popular projects, but her cameos in Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash were disappointing. While the DC Extended Universe may have treated its most prized characters in a disappointing fashion, the new DC Universe will hopefully do them justice.\n"}

The FOX animated series Krapopolis has its two-episode premiere on September 24, 2023, kicking off the exciting new series. The show was already renewed for seasons 2 and 3 well before season 1 was even finished, meaning that Krapopolis has a bright future ahead of it.\nPete Michels is the supervising director on Krapopolis, with him having previously worked on immensely popular shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy. Andy Ristaino is the lead character designer on Krapopolis, with him having previously worked on fantastic animated series like Adventure Time and the DuckTales reboot. Both Krapopolis crew members attended SCAD AnimationFest 2023, promoting the series by premiering episode 3 early as well as hosting a Q&A panel.\nRelated:Why Dan Harmon's Krapopolis Was Renewed For 3 Seasons Before Its Debut\nScreen Rant sat down with supervising director Pete Michels and lead character designer Andy Ristaino at SCAD AnimationFest 2023 in order to talk about Krapopolis. Michels and Ristaino were able to shed some light on the creation of Krapopolis, the influence of other Dan Harmson shows, and the future of the series.\nScreen Rant: One of the biggest names attached to Krapopolis is Dan Harmon. How did his work on shows like Rick and Morty and the expectation of that kind of content influenced the creation of Krapopolis?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like that might be more for me. I worked in character design right from the beginning, and one of their main directors was ‘make sure it doesn't look like Rick and Morty.’ That is kind of how it influenced it. So yeah, we went in a different direction, and a little more realistic and a little less cartoony, basically.\nSo part of the art style obviously is the time period. Were there any challenges that came with adapting this specific time period and mythos to the world of an adult animated show?\nAndy Ristaino: Sure. I mean, I feel like it's all like a lot of costume research and time period research and trying to remember what fruits are available.\nPete Michels: We didn't have pumpkins or coffee. Well, we kind of had coffee I guess, but yeah. Also, I think some of the technology was a challenge too. So Dan's all about making sure that the gadgets and things that they create works, like with Rick and Morty, because I worked on Rick and Morty with Dan, and he wanted to make sure anything that Rick would invent could at least look like it could actually work. And the same with everything we do. But we're limited to Bronze Age technologies. So they have, bronze and they have tin and they have leather and wood and rocks, and you know, sheep stomachs.\nAndy Ristaino: So how do you build a flamethrower out of that?\nSo was the historical research a huge part of trying to make things work, or was it just trying to make things believable and cheating things if you felt like it was better for the story?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like in the beginning there was a lot more historical research than there is now.\nPete Michels: Yeah, well, in design, we didn't do a lot of like, even background is I think a lot of the murals you see on the walls in the palace or the temple. A lot of those are based on Messinian and Minoan actual archeology that we've researched. A lot of our prop designers do. When we give them a challenge, they'll do a lot of the research and look up what something might have looked like or what the technology available was.\nAndy Ristaino: But also the show takes place in that time period before Greek civilization was really established. So we've got a little wiggle room to make stuff up.\nPete Michels: And one of the rules of the show is that they have not yet invented written language. So we can't do any sign gags. It makes it a little challenge. Like, well, we have to somehow identify this building as like a medical office or something. Well how do you do that without saying ‘doctor's office.’\nAnother big aspect of the show is the star-studded cast. So how much of a factor did the stars play in the characters that they were voicing when it comes to the designs and the writing and personality and stuff like that?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like definitely the characters changed. If they were like, ‘we're trying to cast this person,’ but it fell through, the design would change to match the voice actor. And we do a lot of things where we try to match, like, the ethnicity and stuff to the voice actor. And I feel like that's the main thing.\nPete Michels: And there's also a lot of personality that an actor will bring to the character, and that needs to be reflected in the design too. So if an actor is cast, and it doesn't quite sound like that voice came out of that person than we’ll redesign it.\nAndy Ristaino: Deliria needed to be kind of elegant and look kind of intimidating.\nPete Michels: And the word elegant is key there too. Because even the posing and the boards, you try to get her a little bit more regal there and a little bit more confident. She's really super self-confident.\nWhat skill sets and aspects of previous shows that you've worked on do you think really helped you in developing Krapopolis, and what unique challenges did you face when working on the show?\nPete Michels: I think the most important skill set for working in anything in animation is the drawing. You have to be able to draw. I’ve worked with Dan Harmon before on Rick and Morty, so I kind of knew his sensibilities, what he liked and didn't like. My background is mostly primetime adult animation. So The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Rick and Morty. So I think it's that [there are] certain sensibilities that are in adult animation. Characters don't do cartoony poses, for instance, they don't close their eyes for a long time, or they don't bounce and stretch too much. So making it more like humans in a sitcom, that was kind of a big, big thing to bring to it.\nAndy Ristaino: And I think Pete your were a good bridge to that world for us when we're starting to develop the show, because I feel like when you came on the show things really solidified. I feel like there's this realism and primetime sensibility that really sort of solidified when you started working on the show.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and even background-wise you know, just where to put the horizon line where to put the camera to make it like you're watching a live television show that's actually been shot with cameras and live actors.\nKrapopolis seasons two and three have already been green lit, which is awesome. So where are you both hoping to take the show in the future? And are there any details you can give us about what you have in store for the next two seasons?\nPete Michels: They do meet a lot of new characters in the upcoming seasons and a lot of new locations also.\nAndy Ristaino: Go to a lot of cool places. We visit more gods and stuff.\nPete Michels: A lot more gods. I think you’ve designed like 120 gods or something.\nAndy Ristaino: Yeah, I’ve designed a lot of gods and a lot of creatures and mythological creatures and things that were never mentioned.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and I think those are the fun things too because we do not just the gods and goddesses and the humans, but there's also monsters. [There are] a lot of interesting monsters that animation lends itself to that were just really fun to do and fun to draw.\nSet in mythical ancient Greece, Krapopolis tells the story of a dysfunctional family of humans, gods and monsters trying to run one of the world’s first cities, while also trying their best to not kill each other in the process. The series features the voices of Emmy Award-winner Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso, Game of Thrones), Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd), Matt Berry (What We Do in The Shadows), Pam Murphy (Mapleworth Murders) and Duncan Trussell (The Midnight Gospel).\nNew episodes of Krapopolis release Sundays on FOX.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

The revelations of the character's Inhuman heritage, alongside her death and resurrection as a mutant, has made Kamala Khan a perfect conduit for stories about identity.\nMs. Marvel: The New Mutant #2 – written by Iman Vellani and Sabir Pirzada, with art by Carlos Gomez and Adam Gorham – places great emphasis on how deeply being a mutant has become tied to Kamala's identity.\nTaking a moment of solace with Marvel's newest married couple, Iron Man and Emma Frost, Kamala reflects on herself as, \"walking proof that we can all coexist.\"\nRelated: MCU's Iman Vellani Reveals New Ms. Marvel Comic Came to Her in a Dream\nDespite the immense controversy it sparked, Marvel continues to commit to the decision to incorporate the mutant gene into Kamala Khan's DNA, alongside her Inhuman roots, while making the newest X-Men member. Among all these changes, Kamala tries to adjust to the public perception of Ms. Marvel souring upon her reveal as a mutant, at a time when mutant-human relations are at an all-time low. In Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #2, after saving her from an Orchis attack, Tony Stark brings Kamala Khan to meet with his new bride, Emma Frost. During the exchange that follows, Kamala effectively states why she is so critical to the contemporary Marvel Universe.\nEmma Frost cautions the young hero, suggesting that waving her newfound mutant flag proudly is dangerous. This fires Kamala up, leading her to wonders if she didn't go public enough, convinced that she's living proof that people from differing backgrounds should be able to live freely in the same space. \"I'm a Pakistani-American-Inhu-Mutant,\" she shouts proudly. \"I'm literally walking proof that we can all coexist!\" Although Frost quickly shuts down Kamala's idealism, her rant goes a long way in highlighting how becoming a mutant has added to her character. Kamala's story, at its core, has always been about her learning to become comfortable in her own skin.\nEarly in Ms. Marvel's original debut origin run, from G. Willow Wilson, Kamala would take the form of a white woman – specifically Carol Danvers, the previous Ms. Marvel – because, as she put it in Ms. Marvel #3, she didn't think anyone would want to see \"a sixteen-year-old brown girl with a 9 PM curfew\" as a superhero. Subsequently, her stories have always had the core theme of identity, with Kamala growing comfortable with herself over time. Who Kamala is today is someone who would rather change the minds of others than accept discrimination. Being a mutant is just another addition to the identity of an already multi-faceted character.\nWhen the decision to make Kamala a mutant was first announced, there was a concern that the character was being pulled into too many directions; traditionally, however the character has always represented a lot. The mutant metaphor is just another means for writers to give readers a more realistic depiction of a person of color navigating through America. The mutant identity is another way to amplify the more realistic narrative of Muslim identity, as well as the complexities behind Kamala's larger identity. Just as the Ms. Marvel name has belonged to multiple people in the past, Kamala Khan herself consists of multiple identities, all of which encompass who she is and how she approaches life.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

{"title": "Why The Incredibles Broke Pixar’s Most Iconic Easter Egg Tradition", "date": "2023-10-02 19:11:27", "text": "The Incredibles is unlike every other Pixar movie beyond its use of superheroes as it's the only film to not include a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg.\nPixar's animated movies are known for including some fun Easter eggs, but The Incredibles broke the studio's most iconic tradition. The iconic animated studio has a habit of including Easter eggs referring to its own movies or other parts of Pixar's or Hollywood's history. These range from the popular references to A113 and connections to other Pixar movies, with the Pizza Planet truck - which originated in the studio's first movie Toy Story - among the most popular. This even led to the popular theory that there is a Pixar Shared Universe in which all the movies exist.\nAfter Toy Story debuted the Pizza Planet truck, Pixar turned the yellow delivery vehicle into one of the studio's most popular Easter eggs. It was briefly seen in their next film, A Bug's Life, and returned in Toy Story 2. The Pizza Planet truck Easter eggs have varied throughout the years, but it is still an aspect that Pixar fanatics keep an eye out for with each movie. The newest Pixar movies like Luca, Turning Red, and Elemental included the Pizza Planet truck Easter egg. The overall popularity of this reference to Pixar's past makes it even more surprising that the iconic truck is not in The Incredibles at all.\nRelated: All 27 Pixar Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\nThe lack of a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg in The Incredibles is surprising considering every other Pixar movie has managed to include it in some capacity. However, director Brad Bird has commented somewhat on the lack of a reference. Over a decade after the movie's release, The Huffington Post asked Brad Bird whether The Incredibles secretly had a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg. He admitted he had no idea because \"I was busy making the movie. I didn’t think about the Pizza Planet.\" Bird did admit that it is possible that someone else from the animated team at Pixar included the reference, but he doesn't know about it.\nThere were plenty of opportunities for the Pizza Planet truck to appear too. Since The Incredibles takes place in the 1960s, a retro version of the delivery vehicle could have been featured. The city settings included a number of other cars, so a Pizza Planet truck easily would have fit. Fans have speculated that several yellow cars could be associated with Pizza Planet, but the spaceship topper isn't visible. There is also a theory that since The Incredibles takes place in the 1960s that Pizza Planet does not yet exist, so no delivery truck could be included.\nSomewhat miraculously, The Incredibles remains the only Pixar movie without the Pizza Planet truck appearing in some form. The 2004 animated movie broke the trend for Pixar, but all future movies from the studio made sure to include it. The new 19-year streak of Pizza Planet truck Easter eggs began with Cars in 2006 and continues all the way through Elemental's release in 2023. That makes 21 consecutive Pixar movies to include the iconic truck, and 26 out of 27 movies overall. This includes it appearing among Incredibles 2's Easter eggs, so the family arcade does exist in this universe, even if The Incredibles doesn't reference it.\nSource: The Huffington Post\n"}
{"title": "Scarlet & Violet's Indigo Disk DLC May Have Pokémon's Easiest Villain", "date": "2023-10-02 19:02:27", "text": "The upcoming DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, The Indigo Disk, seems set to have the least threatening villain character in the series’ history.\nIt seems that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will have the franchise’s easiest villain for people to beat when the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC releases. Given both the ending of The Teal Mask and its gameplay, it is easy to predict how several aspects of The Indigo Disk will play out. One of these likely outcomes features a villain who appears to be doomed to be overcome with ease.\nIn recent Generations, the Pokémon games have seen some notable changes to the traditional formula surrounding their villains. Perhaps most notably, the Teams of the most recent games, Team Yell and Team Star, have nothing to do with their game’s respective villains. Instead of being evil organizations backing up one of Pokémon’s most terrifying villains, these groups are effectively an over-enthusiastic fan club and a student support network founded by bullying victims. Likewise, the main villains themselves are growing more independent and self-sufficient. The Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games are especially lacking in truly evil characters, but the new DLC aims to change this.\nRelated: Which Pokémon Evil Team Leader Is The Hardest\nThe ending of The Teal Mask does a lot to set Kieran up as an antagonistic force for The Indigo Disk. Shutting himself up in his room, he is seen becoming obsessed with his desire to grow stronger whilst ominous music plays. It’s uncertain what exactly Kieran will try to do after training himself, but assuming he now holds a grudge, he will likely become more aggressive towards the protagonist. However, unfortunately for Kieran, The Teal Mask has also demonstrated just how underwhelming he’ll probably be because the average player’s team is already too strong for him, and this isn't likely to change.\nRelated: Short & Sweet DLC - Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask Review\nThe Teal Mask’s level scaling doesn’t really account for endgame teams, and there is no indication that The Indigo Disk will be much better in that regard. The Teal Mask content offers players Pokémon of differing levels to battle depending on whether The Way Home, the final part of Scarlet and Violet’s main story, has been completed. However, the Pokémon in The Teal Mask are easily beaten either way, a situation which extends to the teams of NPCs. Kieran himself, in his final battle against the protagonist, uses a team with levels mostly in the early 70s, the exception being his level 76 Gliscor.\nThe problem is that by the time people reach this point — as most will have already completed the base games before the DLC’s release — in all likelihood, their teams will be in the level 80s, if not even higher. It is worth noting that the toughest Tera Raid Battles encourage people to battle with the most powerful Pokémon they can at level 100. While Kieran will undoubtedly be stronger than he is at the end of The Teal Mask in The Indigo Disk, this disparity seems set to continue; as such, it is doubtful that his team will truly be able to compete with the protagonist.\nGiven his final levels in The Teal Mask, Kieran’s next team will probably be in the level 80s. As such, with the possible exception of story beats giving him a victory outside of regular battle, it seems that Kieran will be unable to pose much of a threat no matter what he tries to accomplish. This is unless he actually has a team at level 90 or above, but this seems unlikely. Such a team would undoubtedly make Kieran the most powerful NPC trainer in the Pokémon franchise, marking a dramatic change in how the franchise’s NPCs are usually designed.\nRelated: Scarlet & Violet: Nemona Is Pokémon’s Most Relatable Rival\nCurrently, Red’s Pikachu in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver is tied with Cynthia’s Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Garchomp (on a second rematch) for the title of strongest NPC trainer’s Pokémon, at an incredible Level 88. For Kieran to outdo this record with not just his ace but his entire team would be a significant development in this regard. Although this would guarantee more of a challenge, it is important to remember just how easy it is to level up in Scarlet and Violet. EXP Candies are plentiful due to Pokémon Tera Raids, and The Teal Mask even provides an Exp. Charm to boost gains even further.\nOf course, it is important to note that the Pokémon games do offer battles against Pokémon up to level 100. In addition to the extremely difficult six and seven-star Tera Raid Battles, it has long been possible to face trainers with level 100 Pokémon in Battle Facilities. However, Battle Facilities typically represent a more generic challenge that scales in difficulty in response to a win streak. They do not form part of a Pokémon game’s plot like future battles with Kieran will (excluding optional post-game rematches), and so are less beholden to the standard design conventions, which ensure a gradual rise in difficulty throughout a game.\nAny battle with a significant NPC like Kieran must balance difficulty with accessibility so that people are not unfairly overwhelmed in battle. This effectively limits how strong Kieran can become to limit the amount of monotonous grinding required to progress through the DLC. On the other hand, introducing the BB League does mean that several other new trainers will also be faced during The Indigo Disk at a high difficulty level. These are trainers whom Kieran seems set to become stronger than in pursuit of his own goals, so there is still the potential for him to approach impressive heights for any trainer.\nThe Teal Mask sets up future content in various ways, from subtle hints to clear foreshadowing, and a rematch with Kieran is a clear example of this. Given that Kieran is already approaching Level 80 with his Gliscor, it is entirely possible that he will ultimately field a team on par with Red and Cynthia in The Indigo Disk. Nevertheless, given the time provided by the delay between Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s initial release and that of the DLC, as well as the already plentiful opportunities to grow stronger, it is clear that most will have already outstripped him once again by the time this fateful rematch actually takes place.\nSource: Nintendo of America/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "How Thrawn Is So Powerful & Why He's So Scary", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "Grand Admiral Thrawn is one of Star Wars' most unique villains, existing as an intimidating threat despite lacking the dark side of the Force.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 7\nGrand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) has finally made his live-action debut in Ahsoka, and he's already proven himself to be incredibly powerful as Star Wars' latest big bad. Unlike other villains such as Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine, Thrawn is not a Sith Lord nor can he wield the Force. However, there are some key reasons why he's just as scary and dangerous in the Star Wars galaxy nonetheless.\nAs seen in Ahsoka episode 7, Grand Admiral Thrawn is preparing to finally escape his decade-long exile on the extragalactic world known as Peridea. Having been located by his agents with a means of returning to the known galaxy, Thrawn is nearly ready to take command of the Imperial Remnant as \"Heir to the Empire\", starting a brand-new war with the Rebellion-turned-New Republic in the aftermath of the original trilogy. To that end, his first battle with the Jedi trio Ahsoka Tano, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger proves Thrawn's true power as an effective Star Wars villain.\nAt his core, the true danger of Grand Admiral Thrawn is his genius-level intellect as a brilliant tactician. Not unlike Anakin Skywalker whom Thrawn had history with, Thrawn is renowned for his unconventional strategies and offensives, often raising the eyebrows of his fellow officers and superiors. However, Thrawn's results spoke for themselves which is why he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Navy so quickly, eventually being given command of the Seventh Fleet as a Grand Admiral.\nWithin Thrawn's sinister genius, one of his true strengths is his extensive study of his opponents. Seeking to learn their backgrounds, history, culture, and art, Thrawn was able to gain unique insights into his enemies' strengths and flaws, allowing him to press on weaknesses his fellow officers would have never seen. For example, Thrawn was continually one step ahead of Hera Syndulla during Star Wars Rebels, having gained advantages after learning all about her history and even pieces of art held by her family on Ryloth. Thrawn's whole approach is to truly know his enemy. He thus launches plans that take unique advantage of their literal blind spots.\nIn the same vein, the first thing Thrawn does is seek knowledge after hearing that Tano may be coming to Peridea in Ahsoka episode 6. Wanting to prepare, Ahsoka episode 7 sees Thrawn looking over all the Empire's data on Ahsoka, including the fact that Anakin Skywalker was her master. As such, Thrawn now knows that Ahsoka is just as unpredictable and dangerous as Anakin was, motivating the Grand Admiral to adapt and shift tactics. Rather than continuing to pursue Ahsoka as Morgan Elsbeth would have, Thrawn calls off their fighters in order to better position both himself and Ahsoka right where he wants her to be.\nRelated: 14 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Ahsoka Episode 7\nAs seen multiple times in Star Wars Rebels as well as in Timothy Zahn's canonical Thrawn novels, the Grand Admiral often takes advantage of his enemies' fear. Anyone who faces Thrawn typically ends up second-guessing themselves, struggling to figure out whether they're being played. The fear of Thrawn therefore paralyzes them, leaving them indecisive in their own strategies and creating even more opportunities for Thrawn himself. More often than not, Thrawn's preparation and ability to be flexible with multiple contingencies allow him to control the flow of battle in his favor.\nFurthermore, Thrawn is also able to trick his enemies with false victories, using their confidence against them. During the Liberation of Lothal, the Rebellion was allowed to believe that they had fought hard to break through Thrawn's planetary blockade, though the ships that did make it through were met by a second wave of TIE Fighters kept in reserve and hidden within the planet's atmosphere. As such, Thrawn's unconventional tactics and ability to adapt in real time make him a truly frightening opponent to face in battle.\n To that end, Grand Admiral Thrawn has no problem giving ground in the short term in favor of the long game to become the ultimate victor. While others may want to press an advantage at the moment Thrawn has proven himself to be far more patient, though he's also willing to expend necessary forces if it means his foes overplay their hand. In Rebels, probe droids were destroyed during Thrawn's search for a secret Rebellion base. However, he was still able to use the data to shorten the list of planets the rebel cells could be on, turning what others might have seen as a loss into a gain.\nThrawn also knows when to pull his forces back to gain a stronger advantage as seen in Ahsoka episode 7. With Baylan Skoll missing in action, Thrawn called in a retreat and allowed Ahsoka to reunite with Sabine and Ezra. This is because it ultimately bought him more time to eventually leave Peridea. While Morgan Elsbeth saw this first confrontation as a defeat, Thrawn saw the true value of the retreat. He doesn't need to destroy the Jedi and risk his escape when all he needs to do is let them waste time as he prepares to leave, thus stranding the heroes on the extragalactic world.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nIn the past, the biggest examples of Thrawn losing have come from the Jedi and their more unpredictable use of the Force. Kanan Jarrus motivating the Force entity known as the Bendu to enter the conflict prevented Thrawn from wiping out the Rebellion in Star Wars Rebels season 3. Likewise, Ezra's bond with the pod of star whales resulted in the Grand Admiral's exile and the Liberation of Lothal in Rebels' series finale, explaining Thrawn's absence during the original trilogy.\nNow, Ahsoka has debuted Thrawn in league with the Force witches known as the Nightsisters. It's the perfect example of Thrawn having adapted, turning a key weakness from his past defeats into a strength for future victories. While he might not wield the Force himself, he's already made up for it with this new alliance, further proving Grand Admiral Thrawn's status as one of Star Wars' most dangerous villains.\n"}

Here's everything we know.\nFeud season 2, officially titled Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, is arriving on FX, and the next season of the anthology docudrama already looks set to be filled with just as much edge-of-the-seat drama, intrigue, and high-society betrayal. Feud’s first season showcased the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in the 1960s. The next season of the anthology show is moving forward a decade, detailing the feud between writer Truman Capote and his mostly female high-society friends (the titular Swans) and the scandal that followed after his explosive 1975 Esquire article “La Côte Basque 1965”.\nWith a cast that includes Naomi Watts and Tom Hollander, anticipation for Feud season 2 is high, especially since it will be arriving over five years after the first season. The hit Ryan Murphy historical docudrama could arrive on FX by the end of 2023, and since it’s based on historical events there’s already much to discuss when it comes to Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.\nThe most recent news for Feud season 2 came in September 2023 when FX released first-look images from Feud: Capote vs. The Swans. The handful of images didn’t reveal a huge amount of plot-specifics, but they did give viewers their first look at cast members like Tom Hollander’s Truman Capote and Naomi Watts’s Babe Paley.\nDespite several years passing since 2017’s season 1, Feud was reconfirmed as renewed for season 2 in 2022. Feud season 2 was initially confirmed in 2017 shortly after the first season. However, development then went on hiatus for many years while Murphy exited the show to work on other projects. While the plug was never officially pulled on Feud, between 2017's confirmation and the 2022 story announcement/reconfirmation many believed the show wouldn't return.\nThere’s currently no known release date for Feud season 2, although with first-look images circulating it likely won’t be much longer until one is announced. It’s widely expected that the FX anthology show has been pegged for a winter 2023 release window, which means it could debut by the end of the year. However, given the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes throughout the year, it’s possible FX could delay the 8 episodes of Feud season 2 for an early 2024 release.\nMuch of the cast of Feud season 2 has already been announced, along with who they’ll be playing in the Capote vs. The Swans. Truman Capote will be played by Tom Hollander (The Kings Man), with Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) joining him as Babe Paley.\nHollander and Watts aren’t alone in the Feud season 2 cast, however, and the rest of the ensemble lineup of the next season of the FX anthology show includes:\nThe full title for Feud season 2 is Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, which reveals what the story of the next season will be. Truman Capote was a fame novelist and screenwriter who lived from 1924 to 1984, reaching fame with the novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s and 1966 true crime classic In Cold Blood. Feud season 2 will focus on a specific incident from Capote’s life, the now-infamous “La Côte Basque 1965”\nStarting life as a single chapter of the novel Answered Prayers, the article in the November 1975 edition of Esquire marked the end of Capote’s life as a budding socialite. It was clear that many of the characters were based on high-society women Capote knew - the titular Swans of Feud season 2 — with some not even being masked by pseudonyms. Since Capote marketed a lot of his work as non-fiction there was, understandably, uproar, especially since the text included no shortage of scandalous details and gossip, many of it blurring real events with fictionalized conversations.\nCapote was isolated and exiled from the high-class company he’d grown used to keeping thanks to the single chapter. Once a staple of the New York ballrooms, La Côte Basque 1965 saw Capote shunned by his friends and associates — something that pushed him ever further into alcohol and substance abuse. This is the story Feud season 2 will tell, showcasing how the titular Swans went out of their way to ensure that Capote’s article didn’t go unpunished.\n"}
{"title": "Wheel Of Time Season 2 Makes A Villain Reveal From The Books Even Better", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "The Wheel of Time season 2 takes a meaningless villain reveal from the books and turns it into a huge twist with massive story implications.\nWarning: Spoilers for The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 7\nIn addition to copying a villain twist from the books, The Wheel of Time season 2 made it even better than what happened in the source material. The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 7, titled “Daes Dae’marr,” offered a surprise when one of the show’s newer characters, Barthanes Damodred, stood revealed as a Darkfriend. As it turns out, Barthanes was never the innocent nobleman he was presented to be when he first appeared.\nOf course, Moiraine’s nephew is far from the first Wheel of Time character to turn out to be a servant of the Dark One. The innkeeper Rand and Mat encountered in season 1, Padan Fain, and more recently, Liandrin, were all exposed as Darkfriends. For one reason or another, they were lured by the Shadow into doing the bidding of the Dark One and his generals, the Forsaken. Apparently, Barthanes was among the many tempted by the promises that come with helping the Dark One. At an unspecified point in time, Barthanes became a Darkfriend in the interest of gaining political power for his family, Wheel of Time’s House Damodred.\nIn spite of his admiration for Moiraine and seemingly good-spirited attitude, Barthanes being exposed as a villain didn’t come as a complete shock – or at least, not to book readers. Like the TV character, the version of Barthanes Damodred in The Great Hunt was revealed to be a Darkfriend when Rand visited him after receiving an invitation to a party held at his home in Cairhien. Rand knew very little about the mysterious nobleman before meeting him, but by the end of their conversation, it was abundantly clear that Barthanes was allied with the Dark One. His true loyalties were confirmed to Rand when Barthanes passed on a message from Padan Fain.\nWhat transpired between Rand and Barthanes bears few similarities to the story given to the villain in Amazon’s live-action adaptation. Both versions are members of House Damodred, of course, meaning that the book character is most likely related by blood to Moiraine in some form. However, any relationship that he shared with her was not relevant to the book in any way, as Moiraine and Rand were in separate parts of The Wheel of Time’s world at the time. The Anvaere character wasn’t a factor either. In short, Barthanes’ entire backstory was an invention of the show, but also one that made a lot of sense for the series.\nIn contrast to his brief arc in The Great Hunt, Barthanes is a character whose story actually carries emotional weight in the TV series. In the novel, it hardly mattered that Barthanes was a Darkfriend, especially since he was someone that Rand had just met. The show, on the other hand, managed to dramatize it in a meaningful way, thanks in large part to how it fit both Barthanes and his mother into Moiraine’s season 2 story. The development was much more significant for the show because Barthanes was introduced in episode 5, allowing the series some time to make the character genuinely likable.\nHis affection for Moiraine, which felt sincere, added something to the villain that simply wasn’t in the books. This helped create the feeling that perhaps the TV show’s take on Barthanes wasn’t a Darkfriend. After all, it’s worth pointing out that it was he who helped break through to Moiraine, who had been cold and detached since returning to her family home. Moiraine even apologized after treating him poorly and expressed her confidence in Barthanes’ ability to be a good king for the people of Cairhien. Earlier, she had made comments about how kind he is. All this made his story in Wheel of Time season 2 episode 7 even sadder. After all, it’s only a matter of time before Moiraine learns the heartbreaking truth.\nThough Moiraine has yet to personally discover her nephew’s plan to kill her, it’s already had a profound impact on the narrative. Specifically, it was a massive gut-punch to Anvaere. Remembered as Moiraine’s sister in Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time books, Anvaere never appeared in any of the novels and was only confirmed to exist in the canon through a few forgettable references in the prequel, A New Spring. Whereas the books’ Anvaere was never more than a name from Moiraine’s backstory, the TV show’s interpretation of her has already emerged as one of the best additions to season 2.\nInteractions with Moiraine have helped flesh out Anvaere’s character, revealing that she’s so much more than a noble eager to move up the social and political ladder. Anvaere was depicted as someone who had good reasons for being angry at Moiraine. Moiraine stayed away for a just cause – finding the Dragon Reborn – but admittedly, Anvaere knew nothing of it and was understandably bitter about Moiraine’s return. That said, her love for her sister outweighed this feeling, and even led to her providing Moiraine with some much-needed advice. Anvaere then making the difficult decision to have her own son arrested - and forego her chance to restore House Damodred’s good name – gave her a truly great character moment.\nContributing further to the tragic nature of Barthanes’ storyline is what this means for his ending in the series. The idea that the show followed the course set by the books by making him a Darkfriend makes it increasingly likely he’ll meet a fate not unlike what happened to his book counterpart. Shortly after Rand met Barthanes, he learned from Thom that the nobleman was murdered in his bedroom by a gholam, a creature of the Shadow. Since Barthanes has failed to complete the order given to him by Liandrin, the stage is set for he too to die at the hands of one of the Dark One’s minions.\nBarthanes appears to be living on borrowed time. His status and relationship with Moiraine were what made him useful, but now that his allegiances have been exposed, there’s a good chance he’ll be discarded by his masters. The 13 Forsaken in The Wheel of Time have a low tolerance for failure, so Barthanes meeting an unceremonious end very soon feels like a real possibility. But while his death was easily forgotten by Rand and the others in The Great Hunt, it could have emotional consequences for both Moiraine and Anvaere in The Wheel of Time’s future.\nThe Wheel of Time releases new episodes on Fridays on Amazon Prime Video.\n"}

The Infinity Saga revolved entirely around the Mad Titan. From the moment audiences caught a peek at him at the end of The Avengers, each Marvel film built up to the Avengers' inevitable confrontation with him in Avengers: Infinity War. After they lost and half of all life in the universe was destroyed, the remaining Avengers found a way to bring everyone back and defeat Thanos. However, after his demise, it was unclear where the universe would go from there without its central villain.\nThe MCU Phase 5 is well underway, and the franchise still can't escape Thanos. While Kang appears to be the central antagonist for the Multiverse Saga, many movies still deal with life in a post-Thanos world. If the MCU wants to move forward without being stuck in the past, then it needs to establish a fresh story that doesn't rely on fragments of what came before. Thanos is a great character, but his time is done.\nThe Marvels is the next film in the MCU and is both a sequel to Captain Marvel and a showcase for Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan, two new heroes introduced in WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. As the release date gets close, new footage is emerging, and a Chinese trailer featured shots involving a familiar villain. The teaser begins with Nick Fury reminding viewers that Captain Marvel is mighty and one of the few Avengers members who could go toe-to-toe with Thanos. Then, it shows the fight between Carol Danvers and Thanos from Endgame, in which she had him on the ropes until he used the Power Stone against her.\nIt's not a scene many have forgotten within the last four years, but it's a great reminder of how powerful Captain Marvel is. However, the flashback to their fight is a reminder that the MCU is still banking on the audience's connection to Thanos. He is arguably the best villain in the franchise, and many are still waiting for the universe to reach the peaks that it hit when everything revolved around the purple titan. The Marvels isn't the only film that is leaning on the past, as many other MCU projects have dealt with the lasting effects of Thanos.\nThe MCU Phase 4 established the beginning of the Multiverse Saga, but it was also a Thanos epilogue in many ways. Projects like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Eternals had conflicts that directly connected to Thanos' actions and how the world changed once everyone came back post-blip. Even in Phase 5, the MCU still hasn't fully moved on from him. Secret Invasion leaned heavily on Nick Fury's five-year absence from Earth due to the blip and his recent mission, and it included a serum called the \"Harvest,\" which had DNA from the Avengers collected from the battleground of the Battle of Earth.\nRelated: Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best\nThanos was a phenomenal villain, but these stories should no longer be so obsessed with the fallout from his defeat. Kang is here, and if he is to become an iconic character like Thanos before him, he needs more focus.

There's nothing animated scary that we remembered after school, or on Saturday mornings, watching episodes of Scooby-Doo, and watching them go through haunted houses, and how much fun that was, that the teenagers solve the mysteries without parents, that they were all these groovy kids driving around in a van.\nWe thought, \"What if we did a show where it was kid solving supernatural mysteries set in New Orleans, and what if we could do our own Scooby-Doo, or our own Goosebumps, and maybe it's an animated series, and a series of books or whatever it is.\" We wanted to create this world where it's something that is for kids, but that is fun, and teaches you that you can Trojan horse life lessons and things about friendship, and bravery, and all these great things that you can do in a scary story. It just it took years to get done, but we could not have had a better team, and a better crew, and the amazing studio at DreamWorks Animation, and now Hulu and Peacock releasing it, and our showrunners Kristine Songco and Joanna Lewis, and our director Shane Acker. We just have an incredible cast, it really couldn't have turned out better, it was so much better than we ever originally imagined it, but we just loved the idea of doing something set in New Orleans, and using that as a basis for a great scary series, except in our series, the monsters had to be real.\nLooking at Scooby-Doo, you could obviously go the fake monster out, but having this be very real creates more stakes for a lot of the characters, and it's a lot of fun to watch. Now, you talk about the multi-year process and getting this off the ground, what were some of the biggest challenges for you, whether it be creatively or logistically, putting the show together?\nEli Roth: Well, when you come up with a show like this, even the pitch process is very lengthy. First, you have to get the studio on board, and I remember we pitched DreamWorks Animation, and they're so good, they're very patient, so it can sometimes take a year to get the script right, or to get the artwork right. James and I wrote the first draft of the script, we wrote it together, and then they said, \"Let's bring in different artists to draw Missy, and Soleil, and Patrick, and let's have different samples of art. Okay, let's try this, let's bring in a director,\" and now we're bringing Joanne and Kristine before you go out and pitch it. Then, sometimes you pitch to a company, and they would pass on it, or they wait three weeks, or four weeks, before they say no, and then six months later, you go, \"Okay, let's go back to them.\" \"But they already said no,\" it's like all those people got fired, there was a regime change, or places like Hulu and Peacock, the people that are the buyers, their mandates change.\nSometimes they're looking for animation, you know, kids animation is traveling worldwide, everyone in the world watches, it's evergreen, they want that. Then they go, \"Okay, they already have three shows, and they don't want that anymore.\" So it's a combination of lining up the project, getting the script right, getting the artwork right, but also the buyers needing a product like this. Because, obviously, animation is expensive, and it's more cost-effective to just do a season than to just do a pilot, so you have to be very, very patient. We started this in 2015, and here we are in October of 2023, it's finally coming out, but it's really nice when it all comes together and it's worth the wait.\nI couldn't be happier with the show, I think we have something that's so unique and fantastic, and I wanted a show that horror fans could watch with their kids, that if you want your kids to get into scary stuff, you can't start them with Hostel. You need that gateway horror, and something that's fun, that's scary, that's safe, that teaches you lessons about bravery and friendship, and to give kids their own new mythology, a whole bunch of cool new monsters. It's really exciting.\nI love how unique this feels. It feels 3D, but also feels very hand-drawn at the same time. What was it like finding that right look, and what were some of the big things that you really wanted to ensure stayed there, regardless of which artists came in?\nEli Roth: Well, the first decision was 2D, but with a 3D feel, that's what we settled on. Because we looked at renderings in 3D, and it didn't have the same feeling. There's something beautiful and retro about hand-drawn animation that we love, it's just my aesthetic. I started with animation, I made a bunch of short films called Chowdaheads, and stop-motion called The Rotten Fruit, they're floating out there on YouTube. So, even before Cabin Fever, I come from an animation background, and I love hand-drawn animation.\nBut we wanted it to have a real cinematic feel, and I love Shane Acker, he's an incredible director, and I love his film 9, and I love his work. We looked at what kids are going to be watching this on projectors, and on 100-screen televisions in 4K, and we said, \"What can we do that doesn't feel like The Flintstones or King of the Hill?\", which are obviously shows that I love, but something that when you're dealing with horror and monsters can be so cinematic, and so scary, and so rich, with complex camera moves. That was just the commitment that we made right from the beginning. In animation, it's money, and it's budget, and it's time, and working on those animatics, and finding those moves, and finding the look at the monsters. And that was really Joanna and Kristine Songco, who had done the Jurassic Park show for DreamWorks Animation, they're really not just overseeing the writing, but working with the animation studios, and working with the animation directors, and making sure that whatever that aesthetic that we set up with Shane from the beginning was really carried throughout every single episode.\nAnd then, of course, getting the voice talent [is important as well]. I want everything to look like a work of art when you're watching the show, I want it to be beautiful and cinematic and feel like you're watching a movie. That was the ambition of the show, and I think that the animators just hit it out of the park. Horror is so visual, especially when you're dealing with voodoo. James and I thought about how we had seen voodoo represented when we were growing up, and whether it was a voodoo doll, or a voodoo spell that you put on someone, it's such an incredible, rich, deep religion that we had never really seen portrayed like this. If you think about the crossover of religion and horror, it's still happening with The Exorcist and The Nun II, that's the biggest thing in the box office right now. But we really wanted to make sure that we did it in a very respectful way that could teach kids about it, and educate about the Loa, the spirits that help guide the kids, and the values they instill in that this one is for power, and that this one will be for knowledge, and this one is languages, and there's Papa Legba, and there's the Maman Brigitte, and Marie Laveau, and really rooting it in real history.\nWe had voodoo priests and priestesses and practitioners that were on from the very beginning, they were technical advisors, and looking at the artwork. One of our writers was from New Orleans, and her grandmother was a voodoo priestess, so really making sure that even though we're going off into the world of fantasy and horror, that it was all grounded in reality. What animation allows you to do is to render the spirit world in such a beautiful and incredible way so that when I think of what was my understanding of voodoo by the time I was 12, or 13 years old, if the kids watched the show, they'll have a completely different understanding of what the religion in a much, much more grounded way. You want kids to watch the show and eventually when they go to New Orleans, and recognize the different places, and understand the history of the city, from having seen Fright Krewe. People that are from New Orleans are so happy with the show, because they say, \"These guys, they really took the time to get it right and do it in a respectful way.\"\nThe season ends on quite an explosive note. I'm curious if you and James have future plans laid out for this show, or if you're just currently waiting for word from DreamWorks of whether to move ahead?\nEli Roth: Well, we would love to continue it. I'd love to continue it as a TV series, and a book series, and that's entirely in the hands of the viewers. You know how it works, there's a lot out there, there's a lot of content, and if we want this to become the next Scooby-Doo, or the next Goosebumps, it's really up to the public at this point. We feel like we've put our hearts and souls into this, everyone cares so much about it, all the voice talent, the writers, the animators, the incredible artists. Everybody loves this show so much, and hopefully that translates, and if the show catches fires with the public, then everybody would love to do more, but it's up to the public at this point.\nIt all started during detention in a graveyard when Soleil Le Clair, a girl who LIVES for horror, accidentally broke a spell on the Tree of Life and unleashed an ancient evil into this world. The spirit of Marie Laveau, voodoo queen of New Orleans, put her and four other kids in charge of saving the city from Belial, an ancient demon who feeds on fear. Luckily they're not alone — each kid gets a special gift from voodoo spirits called Loa. Super strength is given to Missy, Maybe gets the ability to disappear into the realm of the dead, Pat can understand any language or creature, Stanley gets knowledge about anything he touches, and Soleil can manipulate all four Earthly elements.\nThe ward they live in, the 13th and a Third, is known for fright tourism and Soleil's always loved all the scary legends about her creepy little ward. So she's beyond excited to find out the town's biggest secret — the vampires, rougarous, ghosts, monsters and demons are in fact very real. The creatures have been secretly living among humans for decades...but tensions between the rougarous and vampires have been high lately, and when Missy has to turn into a rougarou to survive a life-threatening injury, the kids can't help but get mixed up in all of it. Our Krewe will have to hone their powers, figure out what Belial's up to, keep the peace between vampires and the rougarous, AND figure out how to be a team because there's no way they'd all hang out otherwise. But going up against local legends like the Feu Follet, swamp monsters, and demon hounds from the underworld is kind of a weird bonding experience, and our Krewe will realize there's more to each other than they thought.\nFright Krewe is now available for streaming on Hulu and Peacock.\n"}

Based on George R. R. Martin's book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy show that follows a series of characters that include Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) who are all involved in an epic war over who should become the ruler of Westeros. Unfortunately, the characters also have to prepare for an invasion from a group called the White Walkers, led by the Night King, who want to destroy the entire realm.\nThroughout the HBO series, Game of Thrones has had a number of strong side characters who played a vital part in the overall narrative, one being the character played by Hannah Waddingham. Waddingham is a prominent theater actress who has graced the stages of both London's West End and Broadway, but most know her for her Emmy-winning role as Rebecca Welton in Apple TV's Ted Lasso. However, even before Ted Lasso, Waddingham's Game of Thrones character became a huge pop culture phenomenon, especially for her iconic scene involving Cersei Lannister.\nFirst introduced in Game of Thrones season 5, Hannah Waddingham plays Septa Unella, a member of the Faith of the Seven clergy and one of the High Sparrow's (Jonathan Pryce) most loyal followers. However, Unella is more collectively known within popular culture as the \"Shame Nun\", which alludes to her famous scene in which she strips Cersei completely naked and then forces her to walk around King's Landing while ringing a bell and chanting \"shame\" for her crimes of committing adultery with Lancel, Cersei's cousin.\nHowever, Cersei ultimately gets her revenge because after destroying the Sept of Baelor and reclaiming her position as the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she immediately imprisons Unella and torments her for all the pain she caused against Cersei. Cersei reminds Unella of the promise she gave to her about how her face would be the last thing the nun would see before Unella dies, and afterward, Cersei brings Ser Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane (Hafþór Júlíus \"Thor\" Björnsson) into her cell. Cersei leaves the room and smiles as she hears Unella's screams while the viewer is only left to imagine how The Mountain is torturing her.\nDespite Unella's grisly fate, Waddingham enjoyed playing the character, specifically because of Unella's drab appearance. Waddingham states, \"I'm not interested in looking dolly all the time, it needs to be whatever suits the character. I mean liked the fact that in Game of Thrones, I looked like I'd just been dug up, exhumed from somewhere\" (via CinemaBlend). Her role as Unella also highlights how talented of an actress Waddingham is as the dour, zealous nun is a completely different character from the more confident and fashionable Rebecca Walton she played in Ted Lasso. Waddingham even got to keep the shame bell after her time on Game of Thrones was over.\nTimothy Lee is a writer and avid movie/TV/anime fan who has been working at Screen Rant since 2023. Ever since he wrote his first film review for his college newspaper, he has been obsessed with the art of film criticism. Whether as a hired writer for small news organizations or on independent platforms like YouTube, Timothy is always happy to write about and express his love for all things pop culture. When not writing, Timothy enjoys going to the gym, spending time with friends, and replaying Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen for the 100th time. "}
{"title": "&quot;The Repulsive RE-PO&quot;: Spider-Man's New Villain Is Too Gross for the MCU", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "Amazing Spider-Man #36 will introduce the hero's most horrifying villain ever, a creature so scary even the demon known as Rek-Rap is afraid of it.\nSince the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become a major success, Marvel's comic book creators must consider that their work could be source material for a future MCU entry – or, alternatively, could be something the company will never, and perhaps should never, adapt to the big screen, such as the latest Spider-Man villain, set to debut in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man.\nLooper has released the first preview pages for Amazing Spider-Man #36 – by Zeb Wells, Ed McGuinness, Mark Farmer, Marcio Menyz, and VC's Joe Caramagna – and in the process, have debuted Re-Po, perhaps the most awful creature Spidey has ever had the misfortune of facing.\nSpider-Man has been edging closer to darkness recently and the series is now set to introduce a villain too gross for the MCU.\nRelated: Spider-Man Launches a GANG WAR to Eliminate All NYC Supervillains in 48 Hours\nAmazing Spider-Man #36 will introduce Re-Po, a monstrous creature from the Goblin Queen's army. Re-Po has a massive, formidable body, with a huge mouth full of jagged – though perhaps not jagged enough – teeth, and not one, but several tongues. What makes this monster truly nightmarish is the face within its face. Sprouting from the hellish being's forehead, connected by a sinewy, organic tether, is a ghoulish white, humanoid face. It's a striking image, one that is perfect for the comic book medium; it would be difficult to imagine Re-Po translating to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, when it feels more suited to a Clive Barker horror story.\nThe current arc will also continue the adventures of Rek-Rap, Marvel's demon Spider-Man, who has quickly become a fan-favorite. As the preview pages for Amazing Spider-Man #36 shared by Looper show, Rek-Rap is absolutely freaked out by Re-Po, seemingly even more so than Peter Parker, who seems more puzzled than anything during their initial encounter. However, the solicitations for Amazing Spider-Man #38 make clear that Re-Po will be a serious threat to Spider-Man and his demonic counterpart, asking, \"Can Spider-Man and Rek-Rep both survive the repulsive RE-PO?!\" The cover for issue #38 features the malevolent new nemesis, whom readers will become much more familiar with over the next several issues.\nPerhaps Re-Po belongs in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man, but it would be an unexpected surprise to see it ever enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villain is one of the most horrifying Spider-Man has ever faced, with a terrifying design that more than conveys that magnitude of the threat Re-Po will pose to Spidey and Rek-Rep. Spider-Man's demon ally has quickly endeared himself to readers, meaning it is unlikely he will fall to Re-Po – but with Peter Parker edging closer to darkness lately at the same time, such a loss might be the unexpected tipping point which sends Spider-Man spiraling further into the dark.\nAmazing Spider-Man #36 will be available October 25, 2023 from Marvel Comics.\nSources: Looper; League of Comic Geeks\n"}
{"title": "25 Strongest Anime Characters, Officially Ranked", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "With so much combat-focused content in anime, it’s no surprise that debates about who is the strongest anime character are a staple of the fandom.\nSome of the longest-running conversations in the fandom center on ranking the strongest anime characters, or who would win in a fight. These debates are likely to go on for as long as new anime air every season. Anime can tell a broad range of stories, and the nature of animation allows anime to tackle just about every genre of fiction, from slice-of-life to sci-fi. However, combat-focused anime (usually in the shonen category) tends to be some of the most popular and commercially successful anime around.\nWith so much combat in anime, it’s no surprise that debates about which character is stronger than another are a staple of the fandom. Of course, with more anime airing than ever before and heroes of ongoing tales constantly receiving power-ups, these debates can change from day to day. It may be impossible to say for sure who would win in a one-on-one fight, but the most powerful characters in anime can be ranked when they are at their strongest and most capable.\nOver the course of Tokyo Ghoul, Ken Kaneki goes from a timid bookworm to a figure of worship known as the One-Eyed King. In exchange for only being able to consume coffee and human flesh, Kaneki gained superhuman strength and the ability to regenerate limbs and even his entire body. After transforming into a half-Ghoul and training his body, he’s able to destroy entire cities easily and command legions of monstrous beasts that can transform others into Ghouls. This makes him a borderline undefeatable fighter who only grows stronger with each injury he sustains.\nRelated: Tokyo Ghoul's Most Divisive Moment Returns in Creator's New Series\nAs the main hero of Bleach, Ichigo wields a diverse set of powers that come from just about every group seen in the series. His Soul Reaper abilities allow him to wield a spiritual weapon known as a Zanpakuto, while his Hollow abilities give him mastery over the dark energies of the monstrous Hollows. Ichigo even demonstrates some Quincy techniques, such as the Blut Vene which can protect him from attacks, and at one point was also capable of wielding Fullbring, a special type of spirit power that only a small percentage of humans (like Chad) can acquire. While Ichigo surely has far more abilities at his disposal than were ever seen on screen, his return in the Thousand-Year Blood War anime has given him another chance to show off.\nA character based on a legend like Dracula has to be able to deliver in the power department, and Alucard in Hellsing Ultimate does just that. Functionally immortal at the beginning of the series due to the number of souls inside of him, and then literally immortal by the end of it, Alucard cannot be ended. He has super strength, speed, and incredible durability, putting him far above the level of a mere human. He can manipulate and control blood as well, and has a plethora of other odd powers, like the ability to pass through walls. His dual pistols are also essentially cannons, and he is able to summon the souls of those he’s eaten to form an army of servants. As if those abilities aren’t enough, Alucard also has an army of demon dogs at the ready that can tear nearly any enemy it shreds in an extremely painful instant.\nThough dissociative identity disorder means Elfen Lied's \"Lucy\" has many voices that make up her character, Lucy tends to be the strongest of the bunch. It's Lucy who most often utilizes the character's numerous abilities. Lucy is both a deft fighter and a near-perfect marksman, but it's her telekinetic abilities that most often stand out. She makes use of psychic \"vectors,\" which act like invisible arms she can use to extend her reach and power. At her strongest, Lucy's vectors can be used to sink landmasses the size of small countries. She could, conceivably, destroy the whole world, securing her a rank among the strongest anime characters.\nJotaro Kujo is the main protagonist of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders. As a person, he’s as smart as he is tough and able to discern and counter the abilities of anyone who would challenge him. His stand ability, Star Platinum, is one of the most physically powerful Stands in the series, despite its short range. After going up against Dio, Jotaro also learned how to stop time for several seconds, allowing him to wail on enemies as they stand helpless. Those without Stands can't even see them, so Jotaro could easily defeat any character without a Stand, without so much as cluing them into what just happened.\nMuzan Kibutsuji is the progenitor of the Demons of Demon Slayer, who gained his own powers when experimented upon by a scientist with a rare blue spider lily over 1,000 years ago. Muzan is capable of turning others into demons and his blood will outright kill those who are incompatible with it. He can shape and mold his body to form weapons and is an absolutely vicious killer. Muzan's only weakness is sunlight; as a demon, he's unable to go out in the day, and he's spent most of his long life desperately searching for a cure for this one flaw. When in the dark, however, Muzan's ability to regenerate is nearly unlimited, and as a result, he's killed many, many demon slayers over the years.\nThe former chairman of the Hunter Association, Isaac Netero is one of the strongest martial artists in anime history. After subjecting himself to training that was supposed to end him, Netero gained incomprehensible speed and strength, able to throw punches faster than the speed of sound. His ultimate ability is the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva, the manifestation of his Nen powers at a level that no other character in the series even comes close to matching. Even if he should somehow lose, though, he has a small nuclear bomb implanted in his chest that will obliterate whoever manages to end him and poison anyone who manages to survive the blast.\nAttack on Titan's protagonist Eren Yeager is a very powerful character who has the ability to transform into a 15-meter tall Titan with incredible regenerative abilities. However, the reason he ranks so highly among the strongest anime characters is because of his ability to command legions of Titans with the power of the Founding Titan. Using this ability, he can bring entire nations to ruin with a simple command that summons thousands of 50-meter tall Titans to action. Entire armies could not stand against this ability, and that makes Eren deserving of a spot as one of the most powerful characters in anime.\nMob Psycho 100's Shigeo Kageyama, more commonly known as Mob, is an ultra-powerful esper who can destroy anyone or anything with a simple thought. His powers are so intense that he has to shackle his emotions to keep them from running wild, meaning that he doesn't often put them to use. However, if he feels something too strongly or falls unconscious, his psychic powers come rushing to the surface. In his ???% state, Mob wields powers on par with large-scale natural disasters. Not only does the nature of his abilities make them impossible to guard against, but the strength behind them is also so great that even the strongest psychics in his world buckle beneath them. Mob is among the strongest anime psychics, though he isn't quite the strongest.\nThe big villain of My Hero Academia, All for One is a villain from the dawn of Quirks, who has used his personal power to gather Quirks that enhance his power and allow him to live indefinitely. Over the time since the dawn of Quirks, All for One has collected hundreds of different powers, ranging from physical attacks to radio wave emission to regeneration. All for One is also able to redistribute the Quirks he steals, allowing him to gain favor by providing underlings with new power. All for One's shrewd social manipulation is actually one of his most dangerous traits, and the reason why it's taken 9 generations of One for All users to even come close to bringing him down.\nGojo is continually touted as Jujutsu Kaisen's strongest sorcerer for good reason. While already incredibly smart and strong, what truly puts him over the edge are his cursed techniques Limitless and Infinity. With Limitless, Gojo can essentially control space, giving him incredible offensive and defensive capabilities. With Limitless, Gojo also has the technique Infinity which makes it so that any attack launched against him can only ever get infinitely close to him but never touch him in an astoundingly literal take on Zeno's Paradox. Gojo might not be impossible to defeat in Jujutsu Kaisen, but his raw power makes him one the series' strongest by a wide mile.\nGurren Lagann's Simon is a simple earthling who incorporates spiral power into the attacks of his giant mecha to devastating results. Commanding a mech so large it spans galaxies, Simon can create a drill with the ability to rip reality apart and destroy literally anything that stands in his way. With a nearly god-like command over life and the afterlife, as well as reality itself, this metaphysics-bending warrior is nearly unstoppable and can obliterate the universe itself if he chose to. Only beings with the ability to destroy entire universes could even hope to stand a chance against him.\nGiorno is the protagonist of Jojo's fifth part, Golden Wind, wielding a Stand ability that goes by the same name. Golden Wind allows him to invigorate both living things and inanimate objects with life energy, which can cause them to temporarily come to life or increase their power immensely. However, Giorno's true power isn't seen until the end of the series, wherein he's struck by the Stand Arrow and his Stand evolves, becoming Golden Wind Requiem. Golden Wind Requiem becomes a rare Stand capable of operating independently of its master and can cancel out actions taken against it, removing them from causality. Once struck by Golden Wind Requiem, a person is trapped in a state of reliving their death over and over again for all eternity--a chilling and terrifying power that no one would want to go up against.\nThe Legendary Super Saiyan himself, Broly canonically debuted in the Dragon Ball Super film of the same name and proved that he still lived up to his reputation from the '90s. Broly was so powerful that even Golden Frieza, Super Saiyan Blue Goku, and Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta were only barely enough to keep him busy. Goku and Vegeta had to fuse into Gogeta and use their Super Saiyan Blue abilities to defeat him, but even that wasn't enough to kill him. Broly was later seen training with Beerus on his homeworld in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, suggesting that this Saiyan's power is only going to become greater with time.\nKoro-sensei is an \"alien\" who wields dozens of incredibly powerful tentacles, which make up the bulk of his body. Koro-sensei is unbelievably fast, able to zip across the world on his lunch break and dodge streams of bullets coming out of machine guns without breaking a sweat. Koro-sensei can only be killed by special \"anti-sensei\" material, which is harmless to ordinary humans even when made into weapons. Koro-sensei is also a master assassin, skilled in various forms of combat--an ability that comes in handy even without a humanoid body. And, while his stamina isn't limitless, it's incredibly high. If he weren't specifically training people to kill him, he'd be nigh unstoppable.\nGetting reincarnated as a slime was the best thing that ever happened to Rimuru Tempest, turning him from a lonely salaryman into a force to be reckoned with in his new fantasy world. Rimuru forged an alliance with a powerful dragon, who shared with him a large portion of his power. This allowed Rimuru to build a following by naming monsters, which granted them new powers, and in turn, allowed Rimuru to grab new powers as well. Rimuru receives guidance from the Great Sage, an AI-like being that offers advice and evaluates scenarios. Rimuru also possesses the incredible ability to take power from anything he devours, a fate that many a villain has fallen to. Rimuru doesn't just have physical power, though; he wields an impressive amount of political power as the leader of the monster kingdom.\nFew anime characters came to regret their incredible powers as much as Devilman Crybaby's Ryo. Though Akira's best friend spends much of the anime series behind the scenes plotting, it is eventually revealed that Ryo is actually Satan. As Satan Ryo commands a massive army of demons that wipe out all of humanity as well as the more powerful devilmen. No slouch in combat himself though, Ryo as Satan actually takes out the series' titular devilman, Akira in a tragic brawl that leaves the heroic devil cut in half. Ryo's misanthropy and raw power ended up costing him the only person he ever loved, making Devilman Crybaby's Satan one of the most tragic and powerful anime characters.\nFans often think of Naruto as the most powerful character in his anime, but even he can't defeat the series' ultimate villain on his own. Known as the Rabbit Goddess, Kaguya is one of the most powerful villains in the Naruto franchise, and may well be the most powerful woman in anime. Not originally from Earth, Kaguya travels to the planet in order to take the fruit of the God Tree. Her plan was to unite people by making them fear her, which is not hard when you can read minds, manipulate memories, travel through space, and control the elements. Once she partakes of the God Tree's fruit, she's also able to heal her own injuries, making her nearly indestructible. Kaguya's powers rank her as one of the strongest anime villains of all time.\nMonkey D. Luffy took a bite of Gum Gum and developed the power to stretch his body, at the cost of being able to swim. That might seem like a big downside for a pirate, but Luffy has made it seem like no big deal over the years. Luffy trained for ten years to master this power, and all that training paid off big time. Luffy's special transformations go from \"Gear 1\" to \"Gear 5,\" and each features a radically different way of using his rubbery nature to enhance his battle ability. Luffy is also a master of Haki, a means of utilizing spiritual power for both combat and non-combat purposes. Though these abilities might not seem so strong on the surface, Gear 5 gives Luffy the powers of a god as he warps reality into a cartoonish parody of itself. These abilities make Luffy one of the strongest shonen anime heroes of all time.\nTetsuo Shima, the de facto antagonist of Akira, awakens his immeasurable psychic powers after a collision with another psychic. His powers quickly grow in strength, and before long he runs the risk of obliterating the entire universe. Thankfully, before that can happen, he warps himself to a place outside of reality and the force of his psychic explosion gives birth to a whole new universe. Few other anime characters possess the ability to both create and destroy reality, and that’s what ranks Tetsuo among the strongest characters in the medium.\n"}

Gino said, “We’re still undecided if we’re actually going to get married.” The 90 Day Fiancé couple explained that they have different expectations from the marriage. Gino wants a local celebration so all his family members can attend the wholesome gathering. In comparison, Jasmine wants a seaside wedding away from the wilderness. She explained, “Since my family is not going to be able to be present in the wedding, I wanted to make it just him and I. No family at all.”\nIt’s saddening that after years of being together, Jasmine and Gino still treat their relationship like a business contract. Jasmine is in the wrong for not wanting to interact with Gino’s family or invite them to the wedding. She is extremely selfish for wanting her future husband to give up on having his family at the venue just because she can't have hers. Similarly, Gino is at fault for not discussing the wedding plans before inviting Jasmine to the United States. He could have clarified his expectations when he first addressed the topic with her.\nIt’ll be interesting to see what is in the future for Jasmine and Gino. The Panamanian single mom has implied that the lip gloss incident will expose Gino and ruin her social media image. However, she didn’t provide more details on the subject. Gino also didn’t seem to defend himself in the interview, which could hint that he is confident he isn’t at fault. 90 Day Fiancé season 10 will show Jasmine and Gino giving their relationship a last chance.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 premieres Sunday, October 8, 2023, at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSources: E!

A contemporary reimagining of the 1984 cult classic of the same name, the upcoming film follows the downtrodden janitor, Winston Gooze, as he suffers a horrible toxic accident that transforms him into a monstrous hero. The film features a stellar ensemble cast led by Peter Dinklage as Winston Gooze alongside Jacob Tremblay, Taylour Paige, Kevin Bacon, Sarah Niles, Julia Davis, Julian Kostov, and Elijah Wood.\nNow, Legendary has released a red band teaser trailer for the Toxic Avenger remake. Watch it below via IGN Movie Trailers:\nThe teaser begins with a series of news reports and interviews with eyewitnesses who have seen the Toxic Avenger. After a group of armed extremists known as the Nasty Lads take hostages at the Miss Meat lunchatorium, the titular hero armed with a glowing mop and super-human strength breaks down the door and takes matters into his own hands by ripping the jaw off one of the hostage takers.\nThe Toxic Avenger reboot trailer shows the first footage of its titular vigilante, though just like the initial image that was released this past August, it's only a silhouette that purposefully obscures much of his appearance. Another batch of images released late last month revealed a clear look at Winston Gooze wearing a tutu pre-toxic transformation. Elijah Wood was also unrecognizable as Fritz Garbinger, a character whose appearance is heavily inspired by Danny DeVito's Penguin from Tim Burton's Batman Returns. Kevin Bacon plays Bob Garbinger who, just like his brother, takes inspiration from a DC supervillain – Lex Luthor.\nRelated: The Toxic Avenger Remake Is Already Shaping Up To Be Darker Than The 1984 Original\nThe teaser trailer also promises that much like the original cult classic, the reboot will feature plenty of blood and gore. This was already expected considering the remake received an R-rating from the MPAA for \"strong violence and gore.\" It's also produced by Troma Entertainment, who was behind the original Toxic Avenger and is known for its exploitation-style movies that push the boundaries of graphic violence, gruesome deaths, and over-the-top gore for comedic and shock value purposes. Based on the red band teaser trailer, it appears The Toxic Avenger reboot will follow firmly in the footsteps of orginal.\nSource: Legendary (via IGN Movie Trailers)\n"}
{"title": "Disenchantment Season 5’s 7 Best Easter Eggs & References", "date": "2023-10-02 18:50:29", "text": "Disenchantment season 5 continues the Netflix show’s tradition of including Easter eggs, with several connecting to Matt Groening’s other shows.\nDisenchantment, the popular animated show from the creator of The Simpsons and Futurama, has just finished airing season 5, which has plenty of hidden Easter eggs and references scattered throughout. The third animation from the mind of Matt Groening, Disenchantment is set in the fictional kingdom of Dreamland, which combines the Middle Ages with futuristic, space-age elements. Disenchantment season 5 serves as the final season of the series, bringing Queen Bean's (Abbi Jacobson) quest to save her home to a close at last.\nDisenchantment follows Bean and her companion, the feisty elf Elfo (Nat Faxon), in their attempts to save Dreamland from Bean's mother, Queen Dagmar (Sharon Horgan). The animated show is known for its hidden Easter eggs and references to popular culture, and season 5 of Disenchantment has continued this tradition, featuring a number of fun nods to itself, movies, and other shows in the Groening universe.\nOne notable reference made in Disenchantment season 5 is a callback to a 29-year-old joke from The Simpsons. In the 1994 Simpsons episode \"Lady Bouvier's Lover,\" Bart tries to sell Comic Book Guy an animation cell of a singular arm and informs the young boy that it was drawn by a man called Hig Heisler. Although Hig Heisler is not a real-life animator, his name appears in the credits of Disenchantment season 5, episode 3, \"Electric Ladyland.\" Specifically, Heisler is given credit for animating the Disenchantment characters' arms.\nThis isn't the first crossover between the two Groening shows. In Treehouse of Horror XXIX, Disenchanment's Luci (Eric Andre) makes an appearance. Luci is seen sitting atop the castle of Dreamland by Lisa during a fever dream. Luci also reappears in the Simpsons season 30 episode \"101 Mitigations,\" where eagle-eyed viewers can see figurines of him, Bean, and Elfo among a pile of trash in Comic Book Guy's room.\nFuturama's Hypnotoad is best known for his oscillating eyes and low hum, using his powers to hypnotize those who watch. These abilities eventually earn the creature its own in-universe show — Everybody Loves Hypnotoad — which becomes a worldwide hit. Hypnotoad returns in the Disenchantment season 5 episode \"I Hear Your Noggin, But You Can't Come In,\" where he can be seen in the background of the freak show. He's sitting upon a gold podium and covered with a glass dome. Locked away in a cell, Hypnotoad can be seen peering through the bars with a sign reading \"Prince Toad\" above it.\nThis makes sense, as Futurama season 11 confirms that the show shares a timeline with Disenchantment. Little is known of Hypnotoad's backstory, so it's unclear how old the creature is. He appears to be the only one of his kind on Earth. If Hypnotoad is as ancient as has previously been implied. it's more than possible that Hypnotoad is, in fact, the toad seen in Disenchantment.\nLuna Park is first introduced in Futurama episode 2 as a theme park inside a giant orb situated upon Earth's moon. Luna Park is inspired by the average 20th-century theme park, and it's revisited multiple times across the seasons of Futurama. It also appears in Disenchantment season 5. The episode \"Who Shot Elfo?\" finds Elfo and a group of escaped freaks attempting to make their way back to Dreamland aboard a submarine. As they set their destination, several other stops can be seen — including one for Luna Park.\nRelated: 10 Ways Disenchantment’s Characters Can Still Return In Futurama & The Simpsons\nIt's not known when Luna Park was first built, but this Easter Egg adds another link between Futurama and Disenchantment. Seeing as the group are traveling by submarine, and Luna Park is based on the moon, it doesn't make much sense. However, it is possible that Luna Park may have started on Earth and eventually made its way to the moon, which could have happened during the destruction of New York in 2308, as confirmed in Futurama.\nIn the Disenchantment season 5 premiere, Queen Dagmar sets off on a mission to locate Bad Bean's body. She begins interrogating the characters about its whereabouts. While Queen Dagmar questions Elfo, he sits at a table lined with different torture devices, including wrenches, pincers, and barbed wire. At the end of the table, eagle-eyed viewers can spot a metal device that resembles Zoidberg's claw on the far left.\nThis could simply be inspired by the Futurama character, but it also could be a reference to the Futurama episode \"Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?\" Dueling using the Decapodian ceremonial process of Claw-Pach, Fry uses a large crab cracker to defend himself against Zoidberg, which looks very similar to the weapon seen on the table in front of Elfo. The Claw-Plach was actually inspired by an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, meaning this Easter egg could be a reference of a reference.\nDuring an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, Matt Groening told audiences that a massive clue had been hidden at the beginning of the opening credits of Disenchantment (via GameSpot). It isn't until Disenchantment season 5's ending that the meaning behind his words becomes clear. The mystery is solved when Bean gives Dreamland back to the Elves. Disenchantment's credits feature a shot of the cast, which is a reference to King Rulo's crown. This hints at the Elves' eventual rule over Dreamland way before it happens.\nDisenchantment's Steamland is home to the Gunderson Steamwork, which is inspired by the 1927 film Metropolis. However, this is not the only reference to the silent science-fiction film. Another is made in season 5 of Disenchantment. Bean is seen embracing a figure resembling a Maschinenmensch (a Robot-Person), the non-human antagonist of Metropolis. It's clear the movie influenced Groening and his animated series, as Disenchantment keeps returning to it.\nIn Disenchantment season 5, episode 9, \"Darkness Falls,\" magic is unlocked and Dagmar is delighted as it slowly spreads across the kingdom of Dreamland. As this happens, a voice can be heard muttering about \"10 years.\" This is a reference to Futurama's cancelation in 2013, the second time Groening's show was canceled before returning for its third run in September 2023. This Easter Egg from Disenchantment season 5 further emphasizes the connections between Groening's series, especially Disenchantment and Futurama.\nSource: GameSpot\nRebecca is an experienced freelance writer from the UK, with two degrees focussing on narrative design and characterisation, as well as being a doctoral candidate on the discussion of the wider public's understanding of minority groups and the issues they live with, through mainstream television, film, and video games. \n\nIn her spare time, you'll find her with her cats, a cup of coffee, and gaming."}

Throughout Big Brother's decades long run, Julie has been the only host of the series and has an intense personal relationship with the series. As a fan of the game herself and a part of the series from its very beginning, Julie often weighs in on what's happening in the BB house, sharing her thoughts on the players and the game as a whole. For Julie, watching new houseguests tackle Big Brother is second nature.\nAccording to an exclusive interview with People, Julie feels that the house's next target should be BB houseguest Jag Bains. \"Jag is good at winning things,\" Julie explained, adding that while he's good at \"winning games...he hasn't been able to steer the direction of the house.\" There's more to Big Brother than competition wins, though, which is why Julie feels BB 25's Cory Wurtenberger is actually running the BB house. Cory \"has the gift of being a persuasive speaker,\" according to Julie, and also \"has a fair amount of people under his belt\" aside from his showmance America Lopez.\nAlthough Big Brother is meant to capture its houseguests 24/7, sharing their most personal thoughts, there's still a code of conduct in place to ensure that houseguests are held to an appropriate standard of behavior. Earlier in the season, BB 25's Luke Valentine used a racial slur and was swiftly ejected from the game, causing a stir among BB viewers. \"It's just zero tolerance for that. That is unacceptable,\" Julie explained. \"That word really stings me. I can't imagine anyone using it even casually. I don't condone it at all.\" She shared that if she had things her way, Big Brother's code of conduct would apply in every situation.\nAs the longest season in BB history, Big Brother 25 has continued long past it's typical season benchmark. Most BB season span between 80 and 90 days, with some in the mid-90s, but BB 25 will be a 100-day-long competition. The houseguests, who have been in the house for roughly 60 days, are feeling the pressure after more than half the competition has gone by. With the series most recent twist resurrecting Cameron Hardin's game after he was unanimously evicted, the series will pick up the pace for the rest of the houseguests as they head towards the finish line.\nWhile there are still nearly 40 days left of the Big Brother 25 season, the houseguests have already played close to a full game. Though there are still weeks to go, the end is on the horizon for the BB 25 cast, including Jag, Cory, and Cameron. With the power shifting week to week, it's impossible to know who will wind up the winner of the longest modern season to date. Big Brother viewers will have to continue watching and expecting the unexpected in order to see what happens next.\nBig Brother airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EDT, Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on CBS.\nSource: People\n"}
{"title": "Where Was Reptile Filmed? Thriller Movie's Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 18:30:28", "text": "The 2023 Netflix film Reptile stars Benicio del Toro as a detective trying to solve the murder of a real estate agent – where was the movie filmed?\nReptile centers around the baffling murder of a young real estate agent and the complicated life of the detective on the case, and the cast and crew utilized a few cities on the East Coast to capture the movie's story. The Netflix murder mystery film, which premiered on September 29 on the streaming service, takes plenty of twists and turns, leaving viewers constantly guessing what the truth is and who brutally killed Summer Elswick. As the movie's synopsis suggests, nothing is as it seems in the crime thriller.\nThe large cast of Reptile includes Benicio del Toro as Tom Nichols, Justin Timberlake as Will Grady, Alicia Silverstone as Judy Nichols, Eric Bogosian as Captain Robert Allen, Ato Essandoh as Dan Cleary, Domenick Lombardozzi as Detective Wally, Michael Pitt as Eli Phillips, Karl Glusman as Sam Gifford, Matilda Lutz as Summer Elswick, Mike Pniewski as Chief Marty Graeber, Thad Luckinbill as Peter, Sky Ferreira as Renee, Owen Teague as Rudy Rackozy, Frances Fisher as Camille Grady, and Catherine Dyer as Deena Allen. Almost everyone is a suspect — the boyfriend, the best friend, the ex-husband, etc. However, nothing can prepare the audience for what happened in the ending of Reptile.\nAccording to Ready Steady Cut, the primary filming location for Grant Singer's Reptile was the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia. Principal photography on the Netflix thriller film occurred from August 2021 to November of the same year, and the cast and crew spent most of their time in the Peach State, even though the movie takes place in Scarborough, Maine, which is a real town. However, Atlanta has become a hub for plenty of film and television show productions, so it is understandable why the Netflix movie chose the Georgia city as its central filming location rather than committing to shooting the entirety of the project in the New England town.\nAtlas of Wonders reported many of the Atlanta metropolitan area locations used in the film, including the Peachtree Battle Alliance neighborhood, the Cabernet Steakhouse, the Inn at Stone Mountain Park, the Westview Abbey Mausoleum, Accuformance Motors, and the Bigelow's nightclub. It seems as though the producers were determined to strictly use on-location spots for the movie, as opposed to shooting the majority of Reptile in a film production studio. All the reports regarding the Netflix crime thriller's filming locations suggest that production studios were not a part of principal photography.\nThe Peachtree Battle Alliance neighborhood was used for the house scenes. The Cabernet Steakhouse can be spotted in a couple of sequences when the characters go to a restaurant. The Inn at Stone Mountain Park was utilized for Justin Timberlake's Will Grady's conference scene at the film's beginning. The Westview Abbey Mausoleum was the backdrop for Summer Elswick's funeral. The auto repair shop Accuformance Motors can also be spotted in one scene. Lastly, the location of Bigelow's nightclub was used for the sequence where Benicio del Toro's Detective Tom Nichols and Ato Essandoh's Dan Cleary interview Sky Ferreira's Renee, aka the victim's best friend.\nRelated: Justin Timberlake's New Netflix Movie Features A Surprising Actor Reunion\nThe cast and crew of Reptile also heavily utilized Marietta, Georgia, another city just outside of Atlanta, for shooting significant scenes in the film. The primary location set in Marietta was the Manley Firm Law Offices, which doubled as the Grady Real Estate company offices where the victim, Summer Elswick, worked in the Netflix murder mystery film. However, the production team also took advantage of numerous spots in Marietta for their movie. But the most important one was undoubtedly the law office building since it was significant to the case in Reptile.\nAlthough most of the principal photography for Reptile took place in and around Atlanta, George, The Cinemaholic reported that the cast and crew also traveled to some parts of New England to capture a handful of shots for the movie. It would make sense if the production team shot various exterior scenes in the region in the Northeastern United States since that is where the 2023 Netflix crime thriller takes place. Unfortunately, specific New England locations used for the movie are unknown. However, it is possible that the crew went to Scarborough, Maine, the exact location of Reptile, to film specific sequences to make it more believable that the movie's events transpire in the town.\nSources: Ready Steady Cut, Atlas of Wonders, The Cinemaholic\nSarah Little is a Network TV Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "The Perfect New Joker Everyone Wants For The DCU's Batman Reboot Already Exists", "date": "2023-10-02 18:30:28", "text": "James Gunn's new DC Universe will reboot Batman with The Brave and the Bold movie, but the Joker that DC fans want for the film already exists.\nThe DC Universe will introduce a new Batman continuity with The Brave and the Bold, but the movie's perfect Joker already exists. There have been several live-action Joker actors over the years, including Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, and Joaquin Phoenix's versions of the Batman villain. While Leto played the character in the DCEU, he will most likely not be returning as the Joker in James Gunn's upcoming DC Universe.\nDC's upcoming movies in the DCU will almost surely feature a new Joker, possibly starting with the still-to-be-dated Batman reboot movie, The Brave and the Bold. While each live-action version of the Joker has brought out a different side of the character, from mobster to gang leader to anarchist and beyond, there is one inspiration for how the Batman villain should be portrayed in the new DC Universe that has come up as quite commonly requested. However, that perfect version of the Joker already exists in live-action.\nDespite only having a cameo role in The Batman and a deleted scene released online to showcase his version of the Joker, Barry Keoghan's Clown Prince of Crime fits exactly the inspiration for the Batman villain that was seemingly teased by Gunn for the DCU. Gunn sparked Joker rumors when he posted images of Conrad Veidt in Paul Leni’s The Man Who Laughs on Twitter, talking about how the original Batman comic book creators agreed that Veidt's role in the movie — a character that had a smile carved on his face — served as the inspiration for the Joker.\nWhile Keoghan's Joker has appeared very little so far, the actor's take on the iconic Batman villain is very clearly inspired by Veidt's role in The Man Who Laughs. Speaking with Variety, The Batman director Matt Reeves confirmed as much by comparing the two, saying, \"He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific,\" and \"his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.” Keoghan's look as the Joker is appropriately grotesque, taking cues from The Man Who Laughs and positioning a challenge for the new DC Universe.\nWhile the DCU's Joker might not debut alongside whoever gets cast as Batman for the new universe in The Brave and the Bold, the Joker will inevitably have to come to the DCU one day. Batman can't be without his biggest villain for long, and so the Joker must come to the DC Universe. Whenever that happens, the DCU will have a very difficult task, as its version of the Joker will have to be different from the ones that came before.\nRelated: How To Watch DCEU Movies In Order (By Release Date & Chronologically)\nWhen there are multiple popular takes on the Joker in live-action, that becomes hard. Still, if the DC Universe's Joker manages to take inspiration from The Man Who Laughs and still feel unique among the other live-action versions of the villain — as the best versions of the Joker have managed to do — then the DCU's version of the villain could succeed. Based on how well Keoghan's Joker — who is directly inspired by The Man Who Laughs — was received, Gunn's seeming tease for the direction of the DCU's Joker is the right path for the character's next live-action iteration.\nSource: James Gunn/Twitter\n"}

The spin-off show follows the titular characters of Fionna and Cake, turning what was originally a single episode with gender-bent characters into a major piece of the Adventure Time puzzle. Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake season 1 has already wrapped, but fans are eagerly awaiting more mathematical quests in the Adventure Time universe.\nAdam Muto is a storyboard artist and animator who serves as the creator and executive producer of Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake. Muto served as a storyboard artist, story writer, and director on early seasons of Adventure Time before being promoted to showrunner for seasons 5-10 and executive producer for seasons 6-10. Muto returned to his role for the Adventure Time: Distant Lands Max specials before beginning work on Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake. Muto made an appearance at SCAD AnimationFest 2023 where he showed off some exclusive Adventure Time deleted scenes, hosted a Q&A, and was presented with the SCAD AnimationFest Spotlight Award.\nRelated: When Fionna & Cake Takes Place In Adventure Time's Timeline\nAdam Muto sat down with Screen Rant at SCAD AnimationFest 2023, where the Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake creator spoke on the challenges of creating the spin-off, cut story ideas, and the future of the Adventure Time franchise.\nScreen Rant: What were some of the challenges that came with differentiating Fionna from Finn in the original Adventure Time series?\nAdam Muto: I mean, the biggest challenge is because they were so closely related, kind of figuring out which way to take her, because Finn had a very set arc from being really young and boisterous and bombastic and kind of gradually aging up to where he ended the series. So she didn't have that kind of runway, unless we treated her as exactly the same as Finn. So it was just kind of finding a situation we could put them in that would let her make very different choices and have a very different milieu to be in, in the first place.\nPart of the series ending kind of was freeing because we didn't have to tie it in as directly. It wasn't like we were cutting to a Fionna and Cake episode in the final season and then cutting back to the main series. It could kind of live as its own offshoot. And that's kind of how we treated it, like this is a branch that can go in a very different direction if we wanted to. And we don't have to show the whole course of her life, we're just kind of showing, you know, a couple of days in her life.\nThe multiverse was already established in the previous show, but Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake leaned into it a whole lot more. Were there conversations about all the other multiverse media that's been coming out recently, and how were you able to make your series standout among these other shows and movies?\nAdam Muto: I think it sort of helped that [the multiverse] already existed as being in the air and almost too many multiverse things right now. So it was kind of like looking at what we could do differently, and what we could kind of strip away and not try to show every single depiction of the characters because it feels like it's kind of moved in that direction, where it's like, ‘how can I show every single version of the character and include that in the story?’. And on a TV budget, you can't really do that for one thing. So we kind of listed all the things we possibly could do, and then narrowed down the list to the ones that felt like they would have the most meat or visually be different, or you know, just a couple of different factors. And then since it was kind of episodic, we wanted to treat it like we didn't have to track all those multiverse strip threads through the entire thing. Like each episode is basically in its own AU. And you know, we'd all seen Sliders at some point. So we just kind of like said, ‘what did we like about sliders? Maybe we can use that.'\nAre there any universes that you hope to include that didn't make it in the final cut that you're able to share?\nAdam Muto: I'll have to look at the list. Some of them were just like, ‘oh, this is a look,’ or ‘that looks cool.’ And they just were visually interesting, but it was hard to say we need a whole episode there. I think initially when we talked about like the FlapJack cameo we were like, ‘maybe we just go to Flapjack for an entire episode and have a crossover.’ And then eventually that got stripped away, because we only had 10 episodes. I'm trying to think if [there are] any others, but that was the one that stands out.\nSo going back to when Adventure Time first made that jump from more episodic storytelling into the lore-heavy serialized stuff. Was there any pushback from Cartoon Network, because around that time, there weren't a lot of animated shows aimed at younger demographics doing these broader stories.\nAdam Muto: What's strange is that they were resistant at first, but then it became sort of a marketing thing, like you could package a bunch of episodes together and promote it as an event. And it was a lot harder to get promos for individual episodes. So it wasn't like we were the only show. They were kind of going to a lot of shows and saying, ‘Hey, we want an eight pack or a 10 pack of episodes that we can kind of lump together’ and even in the later seasons of some of the shows that are still running. Like the last season of Summer Camp Island that was like one big arc. And some of that comes from the creators, and some of that came from the network itself, just having a harder time promoting individual episodes.\nSo elements that ended up playing a big role in the overall story like the Enchiridion - which was around in the pilot - were these things that you always hope to include or was your team just going through and finding things that could work in the overarching story?\nAdam Muto: It's kind of both, where you have things in mind, like what are your significant objects and events in the past that you can refer to that feel like - not that every single audience member would know it - but that felt significant enough in the backstory of each character that you could bring it back and it would have some significance.\nWe tried to leave it in a place where you could start and if this was your first series that you watched, it might be confusing, but you could kind of pick it up. And like, it would just seem like part of the backstory that maybe doesn't even exist. If you didn't know there was an original series, you could still watch it and just think that you're referring to something in the distant past. I think because we’d shown the Enchiridion in relation to Simon, it felt natural to kind of revisit that.\nThe Adventure Time fan base is obviously massive. Did you ever dream that it would get this big?\nAdam Muto: No, we just were trying not to get canceled the first season. I think a lot of that feels so outside of your control. We never sat around and wondered about like, ‘what's Comic-Con gonna be like,’ ‘which characters are people going to ship?’. I don't think we ever had conversations like that. It was more ‘how are we going to finish this in time for the next deadline?’. I think you get kind of tunnel vision. And especially if you're working in a studio, you can look at stuff online, but your day to day is just production. So you know, it's cool to see fan reaction. And when it's in person, it feels like realer in a way because you can see it online and you know, it's detached. It's just text on a screen, or fan art. But then when you see people in person, you're like, ‘Oh, I thought you were tricking us.’ I didn't know if people were actually watching. So it's nice. It's definitely nice, but it's not why we were making it.\nSo with the later seasons, and with Fionna and Cake, and Distant Lands after this fan base was already established, do you feel like the influence of the fan base and the things they wanted to see influenced the show's production at all?\nAdam Muto: I think it influenced especially what characters kind of showed up. Because if they had an established fan base, and the show is sort of fan facing, there are certain characters that lend themselves to a new series more than others. Like it'd be really hard to do a Mr. Pig series or a Shelby series or one about the Snail because the world was so expansive, you could focus on anything. But I'm pretty sure Max wouldn't have said ‘yes’ to a lot of those ideas. So I think the fact that the Fionna and Cake episodes usually got pretty high ratings when it was on linear, kind of made it an easier sell when we were like pitching what the series could be.\nAre there any hints you can give us as to what's coming next for the Adventure Time franchise?\nAdam Muto: I wish. I mean, I think streaming has made it a lot harder to predict the life of what's going to happen for a different iteration of the show, because I'm pretty confident there will be, but I have no idea when. I think in the meantime, we're just developing stuff and kind of seeing what the next year is going to be like.\nBased on characters from the beloved “Adventure Time” franchise, this brand-new 10-episode series set in the land of Ooo follows the alternate universe versions of Finn & Jake on a multiverse-hopping journey towards self-discovery.

First airing in 2005, NBC's The Office would go on to become one of the most popular sitcoms of a generation over the course of its nine seasons. The show, which is based on a British series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, came to an end in 2013, with audiences forced to say farewell to the show's beloved cast of characters.\nNow, Dwight Schrute actor Wilson has shared a new image from a recent mini The Office cast reunion with Carell and Kinsey at a charity dinner party. Check out the new image below:\nIn his caption, Wilson reveals that the dinner party was organized to raise money for the Lide Foundation, with the actor teasing that, while it \"wasn't exactly a reenactment of the dinner party episode... I did bring my babysitter and a teeny tiny flatscreen,\" a reference to one of the show's most notorious episodes.\nRelated: The Office: One Tiny Detail Makes Michael & Jan's Dinner Party Even Worse\nWilson's image follows some exciting recent news regarding The Office, with Matt Belloni of Puck reporting that a reboot is in the works from Greg Daniels, the showrunner of the hit NBC sitcom. This reboot is said to be in the very early stages of development, meaning there are almost no details regarding what it will be about, where it will be set, or who will star in it. At the moment, it's not clear if the show will be happening at all.\nCrucial to note here is that Daniels is working on the reboot as part of a development deal, which is a far cry from a show actually getting the green light. If Daniels can come up with a good idea and NBC likes it, then the reboot might actually move forward. While little information is known at this point, the use of the term \"reboot\" over \"revival\" suggests that the original cast of The Office, despite being a core reason behind the show's success, will not be returning.\nWith the WGA strike having only just ended, it's likely that it will be some time before anything comes of Daniels' development deal. What is already clear, however, is that any prospective reboot faces the immense challenge of recapturing the same magic as the original NBC show. It remains to be seen whether The Office reboot will actually happen, but replacing stars like Carell, Wilson, and Kinsey will definitely be no easy task.\nSource: Rainn Wilson/ Instagram\n"}

As one of the best reality TV shows, it's no surprise curiosity about former Below Deck cast members continues. The Venezuelan native has a heart of gold that shined through during each episode. With the Bravo series behind him, Marcos has embarked on a new adventure.\nMarcos has been working as a professional chef for the last ten years. Even though he's primarily cooked in restaurants, working on a yacht came naturally to the chef. The culinary guru started his career in culinary school in Venezuela but, after graduating, decided to travel. He revealed in one of his BDSY season 3 confessionals that he could learn from chefs from all over the world by doing this. Marcos is settled in Los Angeles and has made his mark there.\nSince filming the reunion for BDSY season 3, Marcos has opened his restaurant, Lou'Mar, by ML Eats, which was initially a food truck. The food fuses cuisine from his home country of Venezuela, Korea, and the U.S. The restaurant serves brunch and dinner with many delicious sounding and looking dishes. On top of being a business owner, Marcos also signed a deal with the University of California to cook for them.\nMarcos teamed up with Below Deck Mediterranean season 7's Chef Dave White for a pop-up event in L.A. The plan was for Dave to add in a few dishes and work in his restaurant during the week, and the event brought in a large crowd. Besides his business ventures, Marcos revealed he will not return to BDSY for another season. Since opening his restaurant, Marcos has become too busy to be a chef on a sailing yacht.\nBelow Deck Sailing Yacht season 3 was one for the books, as the entire cast got along well. Marcos has kept in touch with his co-stars and recently hung out with Chief Engineer Colin MacRae. Even though Bravo viewers will no longer see Marcos on their screens, they can pop into Marcos's restaurant, Lou'Mar, to try his delicious food or continue checking up on him via his social media accounts. Whatever the future holds, Marcos will undoubtedly be a success.\nSource: Marcos Spaziani/Instagram\n"}

Kimberly, a 30-year-old from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, is a clairvoyant who dreamed of her future husband thanks to her spirit guides. Months later, Kimberly received a message from an Indian man who wanted her to be his girlfriend. It was TJ who had manifested Kimberly into his life by meditating on her profile picture. Kimberly and TJ's strange relationship on The Other Way season 5 was a successful one until she moved to India. She had previously lived in Jaipur for a year on a student visa.\nBut now Kimberly is going to get married to TJ and settle down in India for good. However, Kimberly's latest Instagram post reveals she's not in India anymore.\nKimberly posted a video captioned, \"Is it bad how much I want to make a 7 year old jealous of my hat?\" Kimberly wore a propeller hat in the clip and was heading out to pick up her niece from school. Kimberly filmed herself driving with her dog accompanying her in the car. She asked her niece if she liked her hat and, in the end, even gave it to the little child to wear. Fans in Kimberly's comments asked her things like, \"Soo you’re back in America???\"\n\"Back in America, huh?\" wrote another fan before joking that they knew Kimberly and TJ's relationship wasn't going to last long. Meanwhile, one fan posted, \"Pretty sure she can come back to the US without it meaning the relationship is over.\" Kimberly replied to this follower to thank them. Kimberly's response could mean she's in America only for a temporary stay. It would also most likely be one of Kimberly's visa requirements. Kimberly and TJ do get married as revealed in a mid-season trailer for The Other Way season 5, as shared by 90 Day Fiancé on Instagram. Kimberly and TJ are shown getting married in a lavish Hindu ceremony.\nKimberly tells the cameras that it feels like a fairy tale coming true to her. She's happy that she's going to be with the man whom she wants to spend the rest of her life with. Kimberly and TJ are happy during the wedding ceremony as cheerful music plays in the background and even TJ's brother Yash Goswami, who was against the marriage, is dancing in the wedding procession with glee. But there is always a twist in the tale when it comes to Kimberly and TJ. The trailer ends with the couple in an argument.\nA homesick Kimberly annoys TJ so much that he's seen asking her to go back to the U.S., and she screams and yells at him. The scene has been compared to a horror movie. If Kimberly is implying she's still together with TJ, him making the relationship work despite the yelling deserves an applause. She has been difficult the entire season when she lashed out at TJ for not building an apartment the way she wanted it to look. But then again, Kimberly and TJ do love each other and could have decided to accept each other just the way they are in order to have a successful marriage.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSources: Kimberly Rochelle/Instagram, 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}

Glenn is now embracing grandparenthood.\nIn My Big Fat Fabulous Life, season 11, episode 4, Glenn Thore took the plunge and crossed skydiving off his bucket list with his daughter Whitney Thore. However, the surprises continued when Glenn was in for an emotional treat when he received a thoughtful gift from his great-granddaughter, Madeline (Maddie), embracing a new role as great-grandfather. Maddie is the daughter of William, the son of Glenn's long-lost daughter, Angela Burdett (Angie Vincent), and the sibling of Jaime Daughdrill and Cody. Inquiring minds might wonder if this new bundle could be the glue that bonds the Thore family tree and how Glenn will embrace grandparenthood.\nDuring a confessional moment on My Big Fat Fabulous Life season 11, Glenn shades Whitney's age and remarks that Hunter has no romantic prospects on the horizon. Glenn also humorously mentioned that he and his late wife, Barbara \"Babs\" Thore, once made a pact to forgo the experience of becoming grandparents. Hunter lightened the atmosphere by suggesting everyone benefits from this arrangement, with Glenn gaining the joy of grandkids. Although Whitney and Hunter might be off the hook for grandkids, Glenn's granddaughter Jaime is also in the picture, recently engaged to her fiancé, Heath Horton, ushering in a new generation for the Thore family.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nIn a considerate gesture that tugged at heartstrings, Angie sent Glenn a specially crafted pillow bearing a heartfelt message: \"Grand Daddy, I hugged this little pillow, I squeezed it tight, I filled it with my wishes, hope, love, and light.\" The message continued, advising Glenn to grasp the pillow tightly whenever he felt down, assuring him that Maddie's love would radiate from it throughout the day and night. This present from Whitney's secret half-sister appears to be a poignant peace offering, extending an olive branch in the form of affection and comfort to heal past wounds and mend their fractured relationship.\nWhitney underwent IVF and froze her eggs merely two years ago. However, she appears to have shifted her perspective, suggesting that motherhood might not be in her future. In the latest episode of My Big Fat Fabulous Life, Glenn divulged he and Babs had long abandoned their aspirations of having grandchildren. Instead, Whitney seems to have discovered contentment in her role as an aunt. She finds consolation amidst Glenn's extended family, marking a noteworthy difference from her previous fertility pursuits. After disclosing to E! News that her goal \"would have always been to have a child with a partner,\" Whitney seems genuinely happy in her self-proclaimed auntie era.\nJaime, Whitney's niece and Glenn's granddaughter, has yet to appear on My Big Fat Fabulous Life, but she's making headlines. This past August, Jaime took to Facebook to express her excitement about becoming the wife of her long-time boyfriend, Heath. This new chapter in Jaime's life likely brings a sense of fulfillment and pleasure to Grandpa Glenn, now embracing this role to an adult Jaime and a great-grandfather to little Maddie. It's a testament to the enduring bonds within the Thore family as they navigate life's twists and turns, and Glenn undoubtedly welcomes his next chapter and new generation with open arms and a proud heart.\nMy Big Fat Fabulous Life airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSources: E!

This savvy communicator raises awareness for the cause, leaving no stone unturned to spread the message far and wide.\n\nWhen she's not charming everyone with her humor, you'll find her passionately advocating for BCAP31, vlogging, spending time with family, brainstorming ingenious ways to make a difference, and binging on reality tv news to silence the noise.

{"title": "John Wick's Next Spinoff Won't Make The Same Mistake With Keanu Reeves", "date": "2023-10-02 18:20:27", "text": "John Wick seemingly dies in John Wick: Chapter 4, but Keanu Reeves' return in the next John Wick spinoff movie avoids making a similar mistake.\nThe John Wick franchise's upcoming spin-off Ballerina is a strong indicator that John Wick himself is not dead. After four movies of battling endless waves of assassins and High Table enforcers, John seemingly met his end in John Wick: Chapter 4 after his High Table duel with his old friend Caine (Donnie Yen). However, with John already confirmed to appear in Ballerina, he still has at least one more big-screen appearance ahead of him.\nBallerina will take place before John's apparent demise, with the film set between John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4. Meanwhile, the tremendous success of John Wick: Chapter 4 has led to John Wick: Chapter 5 reportedly entering early development. While this might seem primarily motivated by the financial success and critical acclaim of the main John Wick franchise, it is really Ballerina that demonstrates how central the Baba Yaga is to the franchise.\nRELATED: 8 Big Clues John Wick Is Still Alive After Chapter 4's Shock Ending\nThe John Wick franchise is a cinematic universe that has finally begun expanding into spinoffs not focused primarily on John Wick. Peacock's The Continental spinoff series takes place in the early 1970s, which precludes John from appearing, but Ballerina bringing him into its story shows how much the franchise relies on him. What makes that even more true is the fact that Ballerina is the first big-screen chapter of the John Wick universe not centered on him.\nTo be sure, having John in a supporting role in Ballerina is a wise strategy. Ana de Armas' Rooney will be the first protagonist in the John Wick universe headlining her own movie, so having the support of the legendary Baba Yaga is a smart business move. Still, the question of whether the John Wick franchise can thrive without him around has not been truly put to the test yet. Ballerina's strategy of gradually phasing new protagonists into the franchise's spotlight with John still on hand might help it commercially, but still establishes the expectation that John Wick can jump back into action at any time.\nDespite John being laid to rest next to his wife Helen in John Wick: Chapter 4's ending, one fan theory has suggested that John faked his death with the help of Caine and Winston (Ian McShane) to finally escape the High Table. With Ballerina taking place before John Wick: Chapter 4, it could establish Rooney as a potential player in that theoretical cover-up. Indeed, by having John seemingly go out of his way from his own war with the Elder and the High Table to help Rooney on her mission, it has a built-in story mechanism for Rooney to owe John a favor via an assassin marker.\nIn turn, John might cash in that favor from Rooney by asking her to help him fake his death. Ballerina might reveal such a transaction between John and Rooney outright, or it could simply hint to it to save the actual reveal for John Wick: Chapter 5. Still, while the John Wick universe might be stretching its legs with The Continental, Ballerina, and a spin-off for Donnie Yen's Caine teased at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, his return in Ballerina shows that it is still very much the John Wick franchise - and that the world has likely not seen the last of the Baba Yaga.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "The Nun 2 Gets Digital Release Date Less Than One Month After Theatrical Debut", "date": "2023-10-02 18:16:24", "text": "The Nun II lands its digital release date after less than a single month from the opening of its astoundingly successful theatrical run.\nThe Nun II’s digital release date has been revealed. The Nun II was released on September 8, giving it just under a month in theaters. A follow up to 2018’s religious horror film The Nun, The Nun II continues the story of Sister Irene and her battle with the demon, Valak. The Nun II’s cast includes Taissa Farmiga, Storm Reid, and Bonnie Aarons, and is directed by The Curse of La Llorona director Michael Chaves.\nAfter less than one month in theaters, The Nun II has landed its digital release date. First reported by When To Stream, The Nun II will be available for purchase on Amazon and YouTube starting on October 3. Marking just 25 days after The Nun II’s theatrical debut, this release window comes in as one of the shortest windows for Warner Bros. this year. \nThe Nun II’s digital release coming so early on in its run is surprising based on how the film has done in theaters. To date, The Nun II has made over $76 million at the domestic box office and grossed $231 worldwide when considering the international ticket sales. These box office totals are pretty impressive considering The Nun II’s estimated $38.5 million budget. The Nun II even held strong at the top of the domestic box office for three straight weekends, beating out higher-budget films such as A Haunting in Venice. \nThough one of the shortest windows, The Nun II’s quick VOD release is also not unheard of for its studio, Warner Bros. Though less commercially successful than The Nun II, Warner Bros. films The Flash and Blue Beetle became available to rent digitally after only 32 days in theaters. The Meg 2: The Trench saw a gap of even less than 25 days, with digital rental available just 21 days after its theatrical release. \nWith The Nun II’s box office numbers looking comparatively better, Warner Bros. choice to truncate The Nun II’s theatrical exclusivity may seem surprising. Either way, The Nun II’s box office numbers do bode well for its prospects on streaming. As Halloween approaches and more horror films inundate theaters, The Nun II will have a chance to catch those looking for their fall spooks at home. The Nun II’s digital availability will also be good for those looking to binge-watch all the films within The Conjuring universe this fall. \nSource: When To Stream\n"}
{"title": "5 Star Trek Furry Things That Are More Dangerous Than You Think", "date": "2023-10-02 18:11:27", "text": "Star Trek's tribbles are notoriously dangerous, but other furry things like Lower Decks' moopsy pose a greater threat to Starfleet officers.\nOver the decades, furry creatures on Star Trek  have turned out to be more dangerous than one might suspect based on their appearance alone. Some dangerous animals were the beloved pets of famed Starfleet officers such as Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) or Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn). Other dangerous species could not be domesticated, but could instead be found in sanctuaries devoted to their continued care and preservation, whether established for educational purposes or run for profit by Ferengi entrepreneurs.\nWhen these creatures were similar to Earth animals, humans in particular had a way of underestimating certain furry animals native to other planets, usually Class M designated worlds, believing their inherent natures to be close to what they found familiar, only to be surprised when the creatures' actions didn't match their expectations. The contrast between initial impressions and actual actions served as proof that even fauna deserved the same respect and understanding as more intelligent species, a theme that began with Star Trek: The Original Series and continued through Star Trek: Lower Decks.\nTribbles' soft fur and calming coos made them appear completely innocent at first blush, but their high reproductive rate made them ecological nightmares. One tribble became thousands in days, since they were \"born pregnant,\" as noted by Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) during the famed tribble infestation of the USS Enterprise in Star Trek: The Original Series, at which time McCoy determined that their rapid reproduction was only possible after they'd fed. It seemed only Klingons knew of the natural danger tribbles caused, and animosity between the species was mutual, perhaps predicated on the tribbles' side by a genetic memory of the devastation wrought by Klingon extermination.\nTribbles weren't always such devastating creatures, due to the role genetic modification played in their development. In Star Trek: Short Treks \"The Trouble With Edward\", Lt. Edward Larkin (H. Jon Benjamin) believed their biological composition of fur and meat made them an ideal food source, but for their slow rate of reproduction. His 2250s experiments to increase their reproductive rate were overwhelmingly successful, but resulted in his own death and these augment tribbles becoming the dominant version of the species. Further experimentation created the toothy \"attack tribble,\" fortunately contained to Daystrom Station as of 2401 in Star Trek: Picard season 3.\nMugato, also known as Mugatu, Mugutu, or even Gumato, were native to the planet Neural, where they coexisted with the planet's humanoid population, who knew that mugato were more dangerous than they looked. Mugato were ape-like creatures covered in white fur, with distinctive horns atop their heads and spikes trailing down their spines. They looked similar to Earth's gorillas, but the mugato diet was far more carnivorous, as indicated by their sharp teeth, clawed prehensile hands and feet, and venomous bite. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) learned firsthand just how bad the bite could be when he visited Neural, and had to rely on primitive medicine for treatment.\nBy the 2380s of Star Trek: Lower Decks, mugato were deemed an endangered species. They were discovered in the wilds of Frylon IV, where they were the targets of both Denobulan scientists and Ferengi poachers. The mugato displayed their ferocity quite easily to the researchers, who sadly perished. The Ferengi traders, however, found ways of subduing them, so they could sell their valuable horns, and only ceased their poaching only after Ensigns Brad Boimler (Jack Quaid) and Samanthan Rutherford (Eugene Cordero) convinced them a mugato-themed tourist destination would be more profitable.\nSome of Star Trek's most famous Vulcans such as Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and Lt. Tuvok (Tim Russ) all kept sehlats as pets, which implied that these furry creatures were gentle by nature, but sehlats were more dangerous than they seemed. These large, powerful animals were similar in size to Earth's wild cats, with bear-like features and prominent six-inch teeth that marked them as the descendants of predators. Sehlats' aggressive tempers could be calmed through consistent regular feeding, not unlike Vulcans' adherence to strict control of their own emotions through ritual and meditation.\nIndeed, the practice of keeping sehlats as pets was an apt metaphor for Vulcan children learning to maintain control over something as inherently wild as their own inner natures. The bond between them was a mutually beneficial attachment, with the sehlat being fed, and the child attaining the trust and protection of an otherwise wild animal. Sehlats could be long-lived, and remain within families, like when Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) passed his sehlat, I-Chaya, to his son Spock. While not sapient, I-Chaya was Spock's valued friend who nonetheless taught him an important life lesson, seen in Star Trek: The Animated Series season 1, episode 2 \"Yesteryear\".\nThe widespread appearance of Klingon targs in everything from cuisine to children's stories made them seem more harmless than they actually were. They resembled wild boars of Earth, appearing about the same shape and size but for the thick, wiry fur and sharp spines along their backs. As domesticated animals, targs were kept as both pets and livestock, sometimes with little distinction between the two cultural roles. Even domesticated targs were relatively formidable, possessing the same warlike spirit as their Klingon keepers, and capable of wanton destruction despite -- or perhaps because of -- their ultimate destination often being a Klingon's dinner.\nAccording to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's General Martok (J.G. Hertzler), his own pet targ was as much of a warrior as he was, and yearned to return to the glorious freedom of the wilderness, and it was these wild targs that were even more dangerous than their domesticated brethren. As herd animals, they could easily overwhelm an opponent just by acting on instinct, and their natural weapons of spikes, hooves, and tusks gave them ample opportunities to attack. They were certainly far more dangerous than the watered-down reputation that preceded them thanks to creations like Toby the Targ holonovels and simple plush toys made in their image.\nMoopsy was introduced on Star Trek: Lower Decks as the cutest and most dangerous alien yet. It was a small round creature with a pure white pelt, short legs, and dark, round eyes. Its high-pitched call gave it its name, further adding to its deceptive cuteness. Relatively little was known about Moopsy, including whether it was the only member of its species or whether more Moopsies existed beyond the walls of Narj's Magical Menagerarium. One, of course, was all that was needed to verify Moopsy's true and seemingly paradoxical nature: that of a voracious predator, capable of liquifying the bones of its prey before drinking them. Moopsy was nonetheless beloved by many.\nA free Moopsy posed a genuine threat to those in its path inStar Trek: Lower Decks' menagerie. Moopsies did not form bonds like many other creatures that could be kept as pets. They fed on the liquid bones of any creatures at all, including those that seemed stronger and more powerful than themselves. While slow-moving due to its stature and small appendages, Moopsies could launch themselves at victims with terrifying leaps and drain them of their bones in a matter of moments. Their presence wasn't always a forsworn death sentence, however; Moopsy was guided by its own ravenous appetite, and it could be distracted by stray bones or teeth to lead it back into containment.\nMoopsy was a particularly cute creature new to Star Trek with its appearance in Star Trek: Lower Decks, with the contrast between its innocuous outward appearance and its true dangerous nature contributing to the story's comedy. Other furry creatures provided their own lessons in understanding that life was more complex than it appeared. Star Trek has always encouraged people to look beyond initial impressions, after all, and one only needed to encounter a dangerous specimen once to discover that lesson certainly applied to fauna just as much as it did to the intelligent species of the galaxy.\nJen Watson is a writer and artist based in the Chicago suburbs with a lifelong passion for good stories and a BFA from the Ringling College of Art and Design.

{"title": "Us Soundtrack Guide: Every Song & When It Plays", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:29", "text": "Us movie soundtrack is filled with music such as Luniz's I Got Five On It and Beach Boys' Good Vibrations. Here's every song in Jordan Peele's film.\nEvery song on the Us soundtrack perfectly complements writer and director Jordan Peele's vision. In part, that's because Us sees Peele reuniting with Get Out composer Michael Abels, though the soundtrack also features an array of pitch-perfect songs from well-known artists. In addition to Abels' terrifying score, the songs on the Us soundtrack range from contemporary Janelle Monáe-written tunes to Luniz's '90s hip-hop classic \"I Got 5 on It,\" which is notably intertwined with Abels' masterful score.\nWhile Jordan Peele's Us is full of haunting quotes, it's also rife with haunting tracks. For example, Abels' slowed-down version of the '90s Luniz hit helps craft the psychological horror film's eerie atmosphere. Meanwhile, other songs on the Us soundtrack help underscore the film's themes — or add in some much-needed humor. That said, Us is packed with great songs that fill the moments in between pieces from Abels' score. Here's every song in Us, in order of when each plays during the film:\n“I Like That” by Janelle Monáe - Starting at the 11 minute and 23 seconds mark, viewers can hear Monáe's Dirty Computer hit as the film fades from shots of rabbits in cages to the Wilsons driving through a woods-lined road to their NorCal cabin.\n\"I Got 5 On It\" by Luniz - At 21 minutes and 23 seconds, the film's most notable song plays while the Wilsons drive to — and arrive at — Us' significant Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk location. While Gabe (Winston Duke) and Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) sing along, Addie helps Jason (Evan Alex) get into the groove.\n“Good Vibrations” by The Beach Boys - The next recognizable needle drop comes at one hour, five minutes, and thirty-two seconds into the film as Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), the Wilsons' (sort of) friends, argue when Kitty thinks she hears an intruder. Instead of taking her seriously, Josh tells their smart home to play this Beach Boys tune.\nRELATED: What Jordan Peele's Next Movie Is (After Nope)\n\"F*ck tha Police\" by N.W.A. - After her family is brutally murdered by their Tethered counterparts in Us, a bloody Kitty crawls on the floor and tries to get some help from their smart home device, Ophelia. When Kitty tells the virtual assistant to \"call the police,\" Ophelia misunderstands and plays N.W.A.'s \"F*ck tha Police\" as Kitty's double delivers a killing blow. This all unfolds at the 1 hour, 7 minutes, and 43 seconds mark.\n\"I Got 5 On It\" (Tethered Mix from Us) by Luniz - At the 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 42 seconds mark, a reprise of Luniz's \"I Got 5 On It\" plays after the Wilsons successfully kill off the Tyler family's murderous doubles. This version, which remixes the track with themes from Abels' score, was initially used in promotional material. However, when it became a viral sensation, the remix was edited into the film.\n“The Nutcracker Suite: XI. Pas de Deux” by Tchaikovsky - Some of this classical piece plays during a flashback to Addy's ballet days at the 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 55 seconds mark.\n\"Les Fleur\" by Minnie Riperton - In the twist ending of Us, \"Les Fleur\" plays at the 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 42 seconds mark as the camera pans away from the Wilsons' escape ambulance to show miles of Tethered holding hands across America.\nReleased in 2019 by Back Lot Music, the official Us soundtrack features Michael Abels' original score as well as three songs that are heard in Jordan Peele's film. The trio of non-score tracks are \"I Like That\" by Janelle Monáe, \"Les Fleurs\" by Minnie Riperton, and, of course, \"I Got 5 on It\" by Luniz. While Us viewers can stream the film's official soundtrack on Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, they can also stream the other non-score songs that aren't included in the official soundtrack playlist.\n"}

The latter even featured a swinging jazz soundtrack, although - of course - the in-universe name had to be switched up a little.\nThe Return of the Jedi junior novelization officially referred to \"jizz music,\" a term that - in the real world - dates back to the 19th century. It originally meant \"energy,\" but swiftly came to have a far more colorful meaning, one that has amused generations of Star Wars fans. Now, though, a short story in the anthology book From A Certain Point Of View: Return Of The Jedi has generated something of a surreal backlash, with many accusing Disney of a great jizz retcon.\nLucasfilm Publishing has been celebrating the anniversaries of the Star Wars original trilogy by releasing a range of superb anthologies, From A Certain Point of View, each of which contain short stories by various authors. These flesh out background and secondary characters in the movies, offering unique insights into their arcs and motivations. Sometimes the choices are amusing - nobody expected to explore the sarlacc's story in Return of the Jedi - but others are deeply impactful. Slipped in among these tales, however, one - \"Fancy Man\" by Phil Szostak - doesn't refer to jizz music. It refers to jatz music instead.\nRelated: Star Wars Original Trilogy Cast & Character Guide\nUnsurprisingly, the Star Wars fandom seems to be furious. Few seem prepared to let go of their beloved jizz music, and many are appalled at the idea of jatz standards. Ironically, though, this isn't a Disney retcon at all; their complaints are 30 years out of date.\nJatz music was first mentioned 30 years ago, in a WEG sourcebook. From that point on, the terms jizz and jatz have been used interchangeably in Star Wars, both in canon and Legends - and even on official Lucasfilm websites. Sourcebooks and even novels have mentioned both jizz and jatz music, with writers switching between the terms with barely a second thought (although perhaps with a snigger). From A Certain Point Of View: Return of the Jedi continues this trend, canonizing the fact the music has many different names:\n\"Jatz was, of course, one of the most popular forms of performed and recorded music in the entire galaxy, including Outer Rim worlds such as Orto. It came to be known by many names, some less palatable than others, over time and across cultures.\"\nFar from retconning jizz out of existence, the short story actually seems to be confirming the joke works in-universe as well. (This does, of course, make it rather amusing that \"jizz\" was first mentioned in a junior novelization.) All this means Star Wars fans can relax; no, Disney isn't taking their beloved jizz away from them.\nTom Bacon is Head of Screen Rant's Star Wars coverage.

{"title": "The House With A Clock In Its Walls Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "The House With A Clock In Its Walls starts out as a funny horror comedy, but its ending features a surprisingly poignant message about trauma.\nWhile The House With A Clock In Its Walls might be a fun supernatural horror comedy, the movie’s ending offers a surprisingly moving message about grief, loss, and growing up. Eli Roth’s filmography is uneven, to say the least. Roth made his debut with 2002’s grisly Cabin Fever, a backwoods chiller that mixed body horror with offbeat humor and a relentlessly bleak tone reminiscent of the genre’s nastiest ‘70s hits. Roth followed this with Hostel and Hostel II, both infamously gory horror movies, and the gruesome 2014 cannibal movie The Green Inferno. However, the end of The House With A Clock In Its Walls is surprisingly more uplifting and positive than the director's previous films.\nThe 2018 movie is an adaptation of the novel House With A Clock In Its Walls. Lewis' Magic 8-Ball breaks the clock, Lewis has to accept a difficult truth, and the reason behind the creation of the clock is revealed. Admittedly, 2018’s The House With A Clock In Its Walls is an adaption of a horror comedy novel, but the book that the movie is based on features as many fantasy elements as it does scenes of horror. In terms of tone, The House With A Clock In Its Walls is closer to 2015’s live-action anarchic, cartoony Goosebumps adaptation than darker children’s horror movies like Coraline or Nightbooks. Still, Roth earned solid reviews for The House With A Clock In Its Walls, perhaps thanks to the movie’s surprisingly mature handling of death and trauma in the end.\nRelated: 10 Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nThe House With A Clock In Its Walls opens with its hero Lewis losing his parents in a car crash. Sent to live with the eccentric Jonathan and his neighbor Florence, Lewis soon learns that the pair are a warlock and a witch respectively. When the vengeful ghost of Jonathan’s dead friend Isaac tries to end the world with the eponymous demonic clock, Lewis is forced to leave behind his last physical connection to his parents so that he can save everyone. In the process, Lewis lets go of his attachment to their memory and moves on from his loss.\nLewis’ last link to his parents was a Magic 8-Ball that they gifted him. The toy tells Lewis to “Say Goodbye” as the clock enters its final sequence, and he reads this as a message to let go of his grief over losing his parents by throwing away the toy. This breaks the internal workings of the clock, stopping its doomsday countdown. For all of the many genre Easter eggs in The House With A Clock In Its Walls, this moment proves that the movie’s true horror is the tragedy of loss. Lewis wants desperately to maintain a connection to his dead parents and the villains take advantage of this.\nIsaac’s undead wife Selena took the form of Lewis’s late mother to convince him to summon Isaac and, once Isaac was back in a human body, he was able to use the demon Azazel’s dark magic to protect his doomsday clock. This dark magic summoned a giant snake that Florence was forced to fight down in the boiler room, while another one of Isaac and Selena’s traps turned Jonathan into a baby. This needed to happen in metaphorical terms, since Lewis had to be alone when he faced his grief, conquered his fear of loss, and found the strength to throw away his Magic 8-Ball.\nThe villainous Selena and Isaac created the clock to turn back time and destroy humanity after Isaac was driven to nihilism by WWII. While both Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween and The House With A Clock In Its Walls starred Black as eccentric horror comedy heroes with supernatural skills, Jonathan had a far darker past than Black’s Goosebumps franchise character. Both Jonathan and Isaac were scarred by what they saw during the war, with their trauma taking them on very different paths. Isaac’s trauma led him to become a villain as he consulted the demon Azazel about creating a clock that could turn back time and undo human history.\nMeanwhile, Jonathan becomes the strange, eccentric warlock that he is when Lewis meets him. As he did so, the demon Azazel convinced Isaac that destroying humanity would undo the horrors of WWII. Unlike Lewis and Jonathan, Isaac couldn’t let go of his trauma for long enough to see through this lie. Thus, Isaac created the clock alongside Selena, convinced that this would somehow make up for the horrors of the war. While Lewis could accept that something terrible happened to him in his past, Isaac was driven to evil by a desire to rewrite reality and Selena joined him down this dark, doomed path.\nAfter Lewis saved the day, it might seem a little strange that he pettily used magic to hit his classmate Tarby with a basketball and humiliate him. However, this PG-rated horror movie has a good justification for this goofy scene. The duplicitous Tarby had briefly befriended Lewis earlier in the movie, only to turn on him as soon as Tarby won the title of class president. Magic allowed Lewis to stand up for himself, get revenge on his fair-weather friend, and gain a new love interest in the process as he impressed one of his classmates with his magic-assisted layup.\nIn The House With A Clock In Its Walls’ ending, Lewis and Isaac become mirror images of each other. Both the clock itself and the Magic 8-Ball are artifacts that tie the two characters to their past and, while the clock’s destruction kills Isaac for good, the toy’s destruction frees Lewis from his grief and allows him to enter adolescence unburdened by tragedy. While Disney’s Goosebumps reboot offers a PG horror story where kids and adults must face their fears together, The House With A Clock In Its Walls is scary precisely because Lewis can’t rely on his elders for advice.\nIn the final scenes of The House With A Clock In Its Walls, Lewis realizes that his parents aren’t coming back and that, even among magicians, anyone who promises him otherwise is taking advantage of him. His loss is tragic, but he can also let go of his past and move on. This is something that Isaac’s trauma never allows him to do. Thus, Isaac dies for good while the hero of The House With A Clock In Its Walls can venture into adolescence confidently.\n"}
{"title": "Troll 2: Confirmation, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know About The Netflix Sequel", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "Roar Uthaug is parterning with Netflix for Troll 2, and there's plenty to digest when it comes to the director's next Norwegian monster movie.\nTroll 2 is being developed by Netflix and director Roar Uthaug, with the sequel to the hit Norwegian monster movie promising to adapt another figure from the folklore of the Fjords into a terrifying cinematic presence. The first movie in Roar Uthaug’s Troll franchise released in December 2022 on Netflix, quickly becoming the platforms move viewed non-English film of all time (via Variety). While the ending of Troll left the door open for a sequel there was little word on Troll 2 for almost a year - until Netflix finally confirmed the sequel was going ahead.\nTroll 2 will follow on from the first movie, which follows a group of paleontologists who come face-to-face with an ancient troll in Norway’s Dovre mountains. At the end of Troll it was revealed that the beast finally felled by Nora (Ine Marie Willmann) and Kris (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen) was just the first of many. With Tomb Raider and The Wave director Roar Uthaug once more at the helm, there’s plenty to digest when it comes to the possibilities of what awaits in Troll 2.\nAfter almost 10 months with little news Netflix finally gave an update on Troll 2 in September 2023. The streamer confirmed that Roar Uthaug’s Norwegian monster movie Troll was officially getting a sequel, and that filming would begin in 2024. While there was little else revealed beyond this, the fact that director Roar Uthaug is returning alongside the creative team behind Troll has already generated a great deal of excitement for the upcoming sequel.\nTroll 2 is officially happening, with the Netflix greenlight of the sequel to Roar Uthaug’s Norwegian monster movie announced in September 2023 (via Variety). It was confirmed on announcement that director Roar Uthaug would be returning for the sequel alongside writer Espen Aukan. Producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strang Sinkerud will also be returning to work with Uthaug on the sequel to Troll.\nThere is no confirmed release date yet for Troll 2. The Netflix sequel is due to start filming in 2024, so it’s unlikely it will arrive before 2025.\nThere are no confirmed cast members yet for Troll 2, and the only names attached to the project are director Roar Uthaug alongside his creative team of writer Espen Aukan and producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strang. It’s possible that Ine Marie Willmann and Mads Sjøgård Pettersen will reprise their respective roles of Nora and Kris, but nothing’s been announced yet. If the story focuses on entirely new characters it’s possible that none of names from the original return for the cast of the Troll sequel.\nThere hasn’t been much confirmed about the Troll 2 story. However, a few plot details have been teased along with the confirmation announcement. It’s known that the sequel to Troll will focus on another Norwegian folklore figure, though it’s not been revealed if this will also be a troll or something else entirely. \nThe ending of Troll set up a lot of possibilities for the Troll 2 plot. It’s clear there are more monsters inside the Dovre mountains, so the titular troll in the first movie is likely only the first to awaken. That being said, Troll 2 could focus on a different part of Norway entirely, as the entire country has a rich history of local folklore.\nShould any of the characters from the first movie return for Troll 2 this could also impact the plot. Kris and Nora discovered that trolls can be harmed by UV light, and managed to fashion a working trap. The dynamic could be quite different in Troll 2 if the story focuses on them again now that they’ve successfully taken down one of the mythical beasts. Whatever happens it seems likely that Troll 2 will be another unique monster movie for Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Over-The-Top Brutal Fatalities In MK1", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "Mortal Kombat 1 has some of the best Fatalities of any game in the franchise; however, some of its Fatalities are far more brutal than others.\nAlthough Mortal Kombat 1 innovated greatly from its predecessors, it did not change one fundamental part of the game — the Fatalities. Since bursting into arcades in the 1990s, Mortal Kombat has been known for blood and guts — no part of the game quite so graphically encapsulates this as the loved and loathed Fatalities. Ever controversial, Fatalities are such a significant part of the series that they are often taken as a measure of quality for each Mortal Kombat installment. Although some games, such as Mortal Kombat 4, have abysmal Fatalities, others like Mortal Kombat 11 have exceptional ones. Mortal Kombat 1, although not perfect, undeniably has great Fatalities.\nRelated: \"Oh, I Remember This\" - Mortal Kombat 1 Review\nWith a reputation as bloody as Mortal Kombat, each new installment has a great deal of gore to dish out. Mortal Kombat 1, the latest iteration of the tried and true fighting game, does not disappoint in this department. Although the game is more than mindless violence and death, these are undoubtedly the franchise's cornerstones. With an expansive roster of MK1 combatants, most with two Fatalities of their own, there is an abundance of choice available to the player in Mortal Kombat 1; although each Fatality is unquestionably brutal, some are so graphic that the others appear tame by comparison.\nRelated:Mortal Kombat 1: How to Unlock Every Fatality (& Button Inputs)\nAbsent from the previous game, long-time fans of the franchise welcomed the announcement that Reptile would be rejoining the roster in Mortal Kombat 1. A pillar of the franchise since his debut as a hidden opponent in the original Mortal Kombat, Reptile is a reptilian humanoid of the Saurian species. Known for his acidic finishers, Reptile has had some of the strongest Fatalities in previous installments — and Mortal Kombat 1 is no different.\nAlthough both of his Fatalities are brutal, his first, Indigestion, would be a particularly unpleasant experience. Indigestion sees Reptile swallow his opponent whole before vomiting their acid-ridden remains onto the field of battle before finally crushing them.\nA surprise return to the roster, the long-absent Reiko has not featured in a mainline Mortal Kombat game since 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. Despite this, Reiko has returned with some of the most fearsome Fatalities of any combatant in Mortal Kombat 1. Particularly brutal is his For the General Fatality, in which he viciously contorts his enemy's body, using their own bones against them, before ultimately ripping out their spine and raising it aloft as a trophy.\nThe purple color-swapped ninja and Prince of Edenia, Rain, most recently featured in Mortal Kombat 11's second round of DLC. The ever-popular ninja's combat revolves around the manipulation of water, and his most brutal fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is no exception. Rain's Fatality 2 involves the water-bending rain summoning a rope of water which, in a manner reminiscent of an anaconda, constricts around his bested foe before devastatingly crushing their body and decapitating them.\nKung Lao's Mortal Kombat 1 Fatality, Lao’d and Clear, reimagines many of Kung Lao's classic Fatalities. Although it recycles a lot from previous games, this Fatality is, nevertheless, incredibly graphic. Utilizing his trademark razor-rimmed hat, Kung Lao destroys the appendages of his opponent, before decapitating them, and finally splitting them in two. It is truly a brutal Fatality, certainly not for the faint of heart.\nIn Mortal Kombat 1's timeline, Sindel is the leader of Outworld — it is clear from her Fatality, Hair Comes Trouble, that she rules the realm through fear. Like her Fatalities in previous installments, Sindel's main weapon is her incredibly long and powerful hair — a weapon put to good use in Hair Comes Trouble. In which, she tears off her opponent's limbs, lifts them by their shoulder wounds, and asks \"Who's your queen?\" before ripping out their spine and skull through their throat. It is not only brutal but undoubtedly Sindel's best Fatality in franchise history.\nEye-Palling Victory was first hinted at during the early reveals of Mortal Kombat 1 — much to the excitement of many. This fatality is brutal and brilliant, perhaps one of Scorpion's best in the franchise's history. It revolves around his famed chained spears, which he throws through his enemy's abdomen before having them return via the back of their head and through their eyes. Although this is brutal enough, Scorpion then yells, \"Come here!\" as he pulls the chains, causing his opponent's head to be severed and pulled through his adversary's back. Truly one of the most brutal Fatalities in the game.\nIn the new Mortal Kombat timeline, Johnny Cage returns to his narcissistic Hollywood actor gimmick, abandoning the past decade of his presentation as a retired actor and embattled military man. His Fatality Hollywood Walk of Pain is, therefore, a thematically appropriate choice; however, unlike the choreographed violence in movies, this Fatality is graphic and brutal. The Fatality begins with Cage embracing his defeated opponent, which is quickly followed by him smashing them face-first into a Hollywood Walk of Fame-style ground plate before ripping them back and taking a selfie with the faceless corpse.\nAlthough General Shao is no longer Khan, in the new timeline, is no less deadly, and his Fatality, Spin Cycle, is evidence of this. Spin Cycle sees General Shao launch his opponent into the air with his axe and grab them midair before finally rotating them around at such an extreme velocity that the air friction causes his adversary's skin to peel away. This, beyond brutal, is a wonderful step away from Shao's typical axe, hammer, or spear Fatalities, which, although cool, are a little predictable.\nThe Tarkatan warrior, Baraka, is undeniably a great combatant; however, he has often been overlooked, especially in recent Mortal Kombat installments. Despite this, his second Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is one of the most vicious in the game, if not in the over 30-year history of the franchise. It sees Baraka disembowel his opponent, knee them into the air, before creating a fire and using his foe's entrails as a rope to facilitate their cooking. The Fatality ends with a group of Tarkatans ripping off the roasted limbs of the still-somehow-living combatant.\nIn the franchise's latest iteration, the Chosen One, Liu Kang has been promoted to the status of a god. Although some gods are merciful, the God of Fire variant of Liu Kang is rather unforgiving. His brutality is best displayed in his second Fatality, in which he grabs his opponent by the neck, transports them through a portal to the far reaches of space, summons a black hole, and has their body painfully slowly sucked inside — in a manner disturbingly reminiscent of the Ark Covenant scene from Indian Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Liu Kang's second Fatality is undoubtedly the most brutal in Mortal Kombat 1.\nSource: CJR Gaming/YouTube\nBased in the United Kingdom, Luke Horwitz is a graduate student in English Literature and Arts at the University of Oxford, having earned a BA in Music from the University of York."}
{"title": "What Was the First Anime?", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "While it may seem like a straightforward question, the identity of the first anime is a matter of debate, although there is one clear candidate.\nAnime has a long and storied history, naturally leading many fans to wonder what the first anime was. In recent years Anime has become a pop culture juggernaut garnering worldwide fans and critical success. However, its origins are much more humble and controversial with many of the original cartoons being lost to time or under dispute. This makes the question of what the first anime even was quite fascinating to explore. Before discussing what the first anime was, the actual definition of the word \"anime\" needs to be addressed.\nAnime is the Japanese word for animation, so in Japan, this question would just boil down to what would be considered the first cartoon. However, in the West, anime has come to categorize the cartoons made in Japan. Of course, this definition itself isn't perfect as many people feel it doesn't include certain shows they view as anime. The anime-esque Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect example as the show is heavily inspired by Japanese cartoons in both look and story, but was made by an American team with Korean animators.\nRelated: An Incalculable Loss - Thousands of Classic Anime Are Close to Being Lost Forever\nThese sorts of edge cases didn't exist in the early 1900s however, which is when animation was in its infancy. At this time, foreign cartoons were only just being introduced in Japan, which inspired a variety of Japanese artists to try their hands at it as well. Many of the cartoons produced were short clips that didn't tell a story. Given the material on which these were created many of these clips are lost to time, and the few examples that do survive are hotly debated by scholars. The first true widely regarded Japanese cartoon with an actual story is known as The Dull Sword, which was created by Jun’ichi Kouchi and follows a goofy swordsman as he tests out his weapon.\nThe Dull Sword is very different from what modern anime fans may expect. It lacks many of the stylistic features that distinguish anime in the present day, and it is entirely silent. It also isn't very entertaining or satisfying on a narrative level. That isn’t to say it isn’t worth watching for fans of the medium who want to see what Japanese animation looked like over a century ago. It still stands as a fascinating glimpse into Japanese culture at that time and is somewhat humorous at points. However, unlike some old shows that still stand the test of time like Astro Boy or The Legend of the Galactic Heroes, The Dull Sword does not hold up on its own as a good watch.\nOf course, as with all discussions of this nature, there are other examples of early Japanese animation that some may call the first anime instead of The Dull Sword. The three-second-long Activity Photo is one such example despite its unorthodox animation technique. The debate over what is truly the first anime will likely never be settled, but The Dull Sword is about as best a candidate for that title as one can find.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.
