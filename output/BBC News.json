{"title": "Abercrombie & Fitch launches investigation into ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims", "date": "2023-10-03 10:50:16", "text": "Clothing brand Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) says it is investigating allegations against its former CEO. \nMike Jeffries has been accused of exploiting men at sex events he hosted around the world.\nA BBC investigation found an organised network used a middleman to recruit young adult men for the events with Mr Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith, with some alleging they were abused.\nMr Jeffries and Mr Smith did not respond to requests for comment. \nA&F - which runs about 850 stores worldwide, including its Hollister brand - said that since being contacted by the BBC it had engaged an \"outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation\" into the claims. It said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by the alleged behaviour.\nThere is no evidence that the company was aware of the allegations of exploitation at sex events uncovered by the BBC.\nIt has previously described Mr Jeffries as the modern-day founder of the company, after he transformed the brand from a failing heritage outfitter in the 1990s to a multi-billion-dollar teen retailer. He stepped down in 2014 following declining sales and left with a retirement package valued at around $25m (£20.5m), according to company filings at the time. \nBBC Panorama reported that in the months before Mike Jeffries' exit, a pension fund invested in A&F brought legal proceedings in which it claimed the company had paid out settlements after allegations of \"misconduct\" by its then-CEO.\nA source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had seen internal documents describing payoffs for staff and agency workers who had complained about Mr Jeffries' behaviour. The source said he did not know the nature of the complaints.\nBBC Panorama asked A&F if the complaints were of a sexual nature, but the company refused to answer. \nAfter the BBC's published its investigation into claims of exploitation at sex events on Monday, A&F said it was \"not aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct\", and that its new leadership had transformed the company into \"the values-driven organisation we are today\".\nThe two-year BBC investigation uncovered allegations that Mr Jeffries exploited men for sex at events he hosted in his New York residences and luxurious hotels around the world, including in London, Paris, Venice, and Marrakesh.\nTwelve men described attending or organising events involving sex acts run for the fashion mogul, 79, and his British partner Mr Smith, 60, between 2009 and 2015.\nThe eight men who attended the events said they were recruited by a middleman, who they described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. The BBC has identified him as James Jacobson.\nHalf the men who told the BBC about their recruitment alleged they had been initially misled about the nature of the events or not told sex was involved. Others said they understood the events would be sexual, but not exactly what was expected of them. All were paid.\nMr Jacobson denied any wrongdoing and said men went into the events \"with their eyes wide open\".\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of sexual acts\nMen who attended these events told the BBC Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith would engage in sexual activity with about four men - or \"direct\" them to have sex with each other. Afterwards, the men said staff at the event handed them envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in cash.\nDavid Bradberry, then 23, said he was introduced in 2010 to Mr Jacobson by an agent who described him as the gatekeeper to \"the owners\" of A&F, but said there was no mention of sex. At their meeting, he said Mr Jacobson suggested Bruce Weber - then A&F's official photographer - should take his picture. \nThen, Mr Bradberry said: \"Jim made it clear to me that unless I let him perform oral sex on me, that I would not be meeting with Abercrombie & Fitch or Mike Jeffries.\" He said he felt as though he was \"paralysed\".\nLooking back, he said this incident should have been \"a red flag\" but he thought Mr Jacobson \"was just a creepy old dude that I wouldn't have to see again\". \nMr Bradberry later accepted an invitation to a daytime event at Mr Jeffries' former home in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island - recently sold for $29m. While there, he said he spoke to Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith about his aspirations to be an A&F model. Then, he said, Mr Jeffries held \"poppers\" under his nose - a drug which can cause a strong head-rush and disorientation - and later had sex with him.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Signing an NDA \"felt like intimidation\" - David Bradberry\nAnother man, Barrett Pall said he felt pressured into attending an event in the Hamptons in 2011. Then 22, he said he was recruited by an older model, who received a referral fee, to be his \"replacement\" for \"some sort of sexual experience\" with the couple. He said he agreed because the older model had financially supported him and he felt indebted to him.\nMr Pall said the older model told him \"you don't have to do anything you don't want to do\" but suggested that \"the further you go, the better\", and alluded to career opportunities. When he arrived at the event, he said he felt under pressure to \"perform\". At one point, Mr Pall said Mr Jeffries was behind him, groping him.\n\"This experience, I think it broke me,\" he said. \"I think that this stole any ounce of innocence that I had left. It mentally messed me up. But with the language I now have today, I can sit here and tell you that I was taken advantage of.\"\nThe largest event described to the BBC was hosted in a private villa at a five-star hotel in 2011, for which dozens of men were flown to Marrakesh. The BBC understands Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith had also invited friends. Alex - who asked for his name to be changed to protect his identity - said he was a struggling model supporting his family back home when he was recruited as a dancer for the event, where he expected he would have to strip. \nAlex, a straight man then in his 20s, said he was auditioned by Mr Jacobson, who praised his dancing but demanded he \"finish the job\" by performing oral sex on him. \"I had debt, I wanted to support my family,\" said Alex. \"I performed the job and I was, like, disgusted.\"\nThinking \"the hardest part was out of the way\", Alex flew to Marrakesh for the event a few weeks later. But moments into his dance, he said, Mr Jeffries tried to kiss him. \"I was trying to be in it without offending him. I was extremely uncomfortable,\" Alex said.\nEventually, he said he went to hide in a back room where he fell asleep. Alex said he woke up with a condom inside him and feared that the champagne he had been given earlier had been spiked. \n\"When I put things together, I believe there is a very good possibility I was drugged and raped. I'll probably never, never know for sure the answer of what happened,\" he said.\nWatch Panorama's The Abercrombie Guys: The Dark Side of Cool, on BBC iPlayer now.\nListen to the podcast series, World of Secrets: Season 1 - The Abercrombie Guys, available on BBC Sounds.\nThe Abercrombie Guys: the Dark Side of Cool will be released in the US on October 6 on BBC Select, available to audiences via Amazon Prime Video Channels, the Apple TV app and The Roku Channel.\nA civil lawyer, who examined the BBC's evidence, said US prosecutors should investigate whether what these \"brave men\" describe could be sex trafficking. Under US law, sex trafficking includes getting an adult to travel to another state or country to have sex for money by using force, fraud or coercion. \n\"There may have been evidence of coercion for some of the men, whereas others might not have felt the coercive tactics,\" Brad Edwards said.\nHe also said Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith might argue the men were consenting adults and the fact that some had engaged in commercial sex in the past was \"a factor\", although he said past actions were \"really irrelevant\" to whether a particular commercial sex act was because of force, fraud or coercion. \n\"Given the stories of these brave men that have come forward, I think it's very important that federal prosecutors look into this case,\" Mr Edwards said, adding there was a \"very high\" burden of proof for prosecutors, however.\nThe BBC made repeated attempts by letter, email and phone, over several weeks, to contact Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith, inviting them to respond to a detailed list of allegations to ensure they were fully aware of the claims against them. They have not responded.\nMr Jacobson - the middleman, now aged 70 - said in a statement through his lawyer that he took offence at the suggestion of \"any coercive, deceptive or forceful behaviour on my part\" and had \"no knowledge of any such conduct by others\".\nHe said he did not recall making promises of modelling opportunities. \"Any encounter I had was fully consensual, not coercive,\" he said. \"Everyone I came into contact with who attended these events went in with their eyes wide open.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?

Jade Ward had previously been known as Jade Marsh.\nMs Ward's parents, Karen Robinson and Paul Ward, have been campaigning for a change in the law since her murder. \nEdwin Duggan, a friend of the Ward family and campaigner for Jade's Law, said he felt overjoyed, but also shocked following previous setbacks.  \n\"There was a lot of restraint on the [Ministry of Justice] side. They thought there was enough legislation that would suffice.\n\"Anyone could apply to have parental responsibility removed. Our argument was they shouldn't have it in the first place.\n\"When this goes through, I know it will save lives. Families in the future will not have to go through what Karen and Paul have.\"\nThe announcement was welcomed by Mark Tami, the Labour MP for Alyn and Deeside, who has been supporting the family's campaign.\nHe said: \"I'm delighted that the government has finally changed their mind despite telling me for so long that it couldn't be done.\"\nAn online petition got more than 130,000 signatures and triggered a parliamentary debate.\nIn July an amendment to a Bill to suspend the rights of killer parents in jail was turned down by MPs.\nThe Ministry of Justice said legislation was already in place for judges to \"effectively remove all rights and powers from a parent who has murdered the other\", but it added it was \"eager to go further.\"  \nJustice Secretary Alex Chalk will outline plans to introduce Jade's Law at the Conservative conference later on Tuesday.\nHe said the campaign had \"exposed an injustice\" in the system.\n\"Murderers who kill their partners should not be able to manipulate and control their children from behind bars, which is why we are fixing the law to protect families from this appalling behaviour,\" he said. \nThe new legislation will introduce an automatic suspension of parental responsibility while any mother or father is serving time for killing the person they shared that responsibility with.\nIt means the burden will no longer be on family members to apply to the family court to ask for the parental rights of a killer to be removed.\nThere will be an exemption for parents who kill their partner in a relationship with a history of domestic abuse.\nThe measures will be introduced to parliament as part of the Victims and Prisoners Bill before the end of the year.\nMan jailed for murdering wife as children slept\nFamily has setback stopping killer parents' rights\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "NewsClick: Raid on India news site over China funding claims", "date": "2023-10-03 10:54:03", "text": "Police in the Indian capital, Delhi, have raided the homes of several prominent journalists and authors in connection with an investigation into the funding of news website NewsClick.\nPolice have seized mobile phones and laptops of those they raided on Tuesday morning.\nOfficials are reportedly investigating allegations that NewsClick got illegal funds from China - a charge it denies. \nCritics say the move is an intentional attack on press freedom.\nStarted in 2009, NewsClick is an independent news and current affairs website which is known to be critical of the government. In 2021, it was raided by tax authorities on allegations of breaking India's foreign direct investment rules. \nThe co-ordinated raids at 30 locations on Tuesday are some of the largest and most extensive on India's media in recent years. Opposition leaders have called it the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) government's \"fresh attack on the media\". \nBut Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur has denied any involvement of the government, saying that the investigative agencies were merely doing their job. \nAmong those who have been searched are NewsClick editor Prabir Purkayastha, journalists Abhisar Sharma, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Aunindyo Chakravarty, Bhasha Singh, popular satirist Sanjay Rajoura and historian Sohail Hashmi. Some of them have been taken to police stations for questioning.\nSearches were also under way at the website's office in Delhi, along with 30 other locations, news agency ANI reported. \nIn Mumbai city, activist Teesta Setalvad's house was also searched. Ms Setalvad has long fought for victims of the deadly 2002 riots in Gujarat state and has written articles critical of the government for Newsclick.\nA source close of Mr Purkayastha told the BBC that more than 15 policemen arrived at his home at 06:30 local time (01:00GMT). \n\"They did not produce any warrants or paperwork, questioned him for several hours and took away all the electronic devices they found at home,\" they said. Later, news agencies showed him being taken away by the police in a vehicle. \nMr Rajoura's lawyer Ilin Saraswat said the comedian was raided at the same time and that police took away his laptop, his two phones, some DVDs of his old work and some documents. \n\"The police said that Mr Rajoura is not named in the current investigation, but since he has worked with the website, he will be interrogated. We have not been provided a copy of the police complaint,\" he added.\nThe police have not yet commented on the raids and Delhi Police spokesperson Suman Nalwa declined the BBC's request for comment - she said she would \"share the details when she gets them\".  \nAccording to reports, the raids are in connection with a case registered against NewsClick in August after a New York Times report alleged that the website had received funds from an American millionaire to spread \"Chinese propaganda\". \nIt claimed that Neville Roy Singham worked closely with the \"Chinese government media machine\" and used his network of non-profit groups and shell companies to \"finance its propaganda worldwide\".\nA case was reportedly registered against the website under UAPA, a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. NewsClick has strongly denied all the charges as false. \nAll the people who were raided have been associated with NewsClick - some are employees while others have worked on freelance projects. \nPrabir Purkayastha, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website, is the author of a number of books. During the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - he was jailed along with several opposition politicians.An engineering major, he is also a science activist and a founding member of the Delhi Science Forum, a non-profit that works in the areas of science and technology policies\nBhasha Singh is an activist and journalist who has reported extensively on manual scavenging and farmers' suicides in northern India. On Sunday, she attended a national conference by the All India Progressive Women's Association where she accused the the government of being anti-women. \nA day later, she appeared in a Newsclick video, expressing concern over the increasing trend of praising Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse by members of India's governing BJP party. \nAbhisar Sharma is well-known video journalist with over 1.8m followers on X and nearly 3m subscribers on his YouTube channel. He worked for BBC Hindi before moving on to work as a Hindi presenter at the NDTV news channel. \nMr Sharma is known for his critical views of the government. One of his last videos covered widespread protests by government employees against the new pension scheme. \nSanjay Rajoura is a popular stand-up comedian and part of the comedy-music trio Aisi Taisi Democracy (Democracy be damned). Mr Rajoura is known for biting political satire that often critiques the ruling party. His work spans topics of caste, masculinity, freedom of speech and fake news. The comedian has also worked in Bollywood, acting in films like City of Dark and The Seal.\nSohail Hashmi is a historian, activist and filmmaker who's been holding talks and heritage walks on Delhi's history for over a decade. This month, Sahmat, a trust run by him, is organising programmes to observe the 75th anniversary Mahatma Gandhi's assassination.\nThe police are yet to share the complete details of their investigation - and it's not clear when they will do so - but the raids have sparked outrage in the country. \nSeveral associations of journalists and news organisations criticised the police action, which they called \"another instance of the government's pattern of arbitrary and intimidatory behaviour\".\nThe Press Club of India said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the raids and urged the government to \"come out with details\" about the case.\nIn a joint statement, the National Alliance of Journalists and Delhi Union of Journalists accused the government of targeting NewsClick for \"their coverage of the issues of workers and farmers\". \nSince Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, a number of media outlets have been investigated by the government for alleged financial impropriety, raising fears about press freedom in the world's largest democracy.\nEarlier this year, tax officials searched BBC offices in India, questioning staff about the organisation's business operations in the country. The searches in Delhi and Mumbai had come weeks after the broadcaster aired a documentary in the UK critical of Mr Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots.\nTax officials also accused the Dainik Bhaskar newspaper of tax evasion in 2021 after its critical coverage of the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nReporters Without Borders, an advocacy group for journalists, has placed India at 161st place in its press freedom rankings this year. It said the situation in the country has deteriorated from \"problematic\" to \"very bad\" and compared it with Tajikistan (at 153rd) and Turkey (at 165th).\nAdditional reporting by Meryl Sebastian in Kochi\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

{"title": "Inquiry to focus on government as stakes rise", "date": "2023-10-03 00:24:13", "text": "Decisions made by Boris Johnson, his government and his team of scientists in the early days of the pandemic are to come under intense scrutiny as the second part of the Covid inquiry begins.\nUntil Christmas, the spotlight will be on key decisions made to try to control the spread of the virus, from lockdowns to border controls to face masks. But what is at stake for the ex-prime minister and his former team?\nOn 7 March 2020, England beat Wales in front of 82,000 in a Six Nations rugby match at Twickenham. Mr Johnson was in the crowd shaking hands with England captain Owen Farrell.\nOn the same day, newspaper front pages were full of one subject. \n\"Official: It's an outbreak,\" said the Sun. \"Millions told: work at home to fight virus,\" said the Daily Mail.\nThat weekend, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a lockdown across the north of the country as Covid cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals.\nIn the UK, where only two deaths had been confirmed, the message was still to wash our hands and carry on - cautiously - with our lives.\nThe next week, horse racing's Cheltenham Festival went ahead with 250,000 spectators, while 3,000 Atletico Madrid football fans flew to Liverpool for a Champions League match, when Spanish restrictions would have stopped them going to a match at home.\nGeoff Bodman, 59, was at both Twickenham and Cheltenham that spring and is sure he was infected with Covid at one of those events. \nLater that month he was put on a ventilator at a hospital in Cardiff, followed by two months in intensive care during which he suffered a stroke.\n\"With hindsight, the government should have acted more decisively and put a block on things,\" he says.\n\"It would have been disruptive for a lot of people, but lives would have been saved.\"\nHundreds of articles and books have already been written about the government's early response to Covid. An investigation by MPs described it as one of the country's worst public health failures.\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock published his version of what happened, and then had thousands of his WhatsApp messages leaked to the Daily Telegraph. \nNow though, the Covid-19 public inquiry, led by former judge Baroness Hallett, is opening its own investigation. \nThe first part of the inquiry, examining just the planning for a pandemic, finished hearing witnesses back in July, with a final report due in 2024. \nThis second part looks at the decisions made after Covid emerged with \"particular scrutiny\" of the period until 23 March 2020 when the UK went into full lockdown.\nIt will ask:\nIt will investigate whether the impact on the economy, education and mental health were ever properly considered.\n\"I didn't see another human being for 18 months, except for when I went to get my jabs,\" says James Hollens, who has two types of autoimmune arthritis and a weakened immune system because of the medication he is taking.\nNew research for the charity Versus Arthritis found there was a \"sizeable impact\" on the mental health of people - like James - who shielded through the pandemic. \n\"We were told to just stay inside and wait for the next news conference,\" he adds.\n\"Not once did anyone reach out and check how we were doing mentally or physically.\"\nThis part of the inquiry will look at how at-risk groups were identified and the effect of lockdown and social distancing on those individuals. \nCrucially it will also examine \"public confidence\" in the government's policies \"including the impact of alleged breaches of rules and standards by ministers, officials and advisers\".\nAs a public inquiry, Baroness Hallett and her team have specific powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to give evidence under oath, and force the release of documents.  \nThat was seen earlier this year when the government lost a legal challenge to prevent the release of ministers' WhatsApp messages and diaries in full. \nExpect those texts to form a key part of the questioning, with Mr Johnson, Mr Hancock and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak all likely to give evidence. \nThere is significant potential for this to be embarrassing for the government, as it will shine a light on their decision-making, who did what, and what was said behind closed doors.\nAnother two weeks is set aside to hear from advisers and civil servants, expected to include Dominic Cummings and former cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill.\nGroups representing the families of some of the 230,000 who lost their lives are worried they may not have a proper chance to have their say. \nThe UK-wide part of this second module runs until Christmas when the inquiry will then move to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to investigate the way they handled Covid.\nA public inquiry is not a court case or a criminal trial and there are no sanctions at the end of the process. The chairperson does not have the power to send anyone to prison or impose a fine. \nInstead the idea is to establish the facts of what happened and learn lessons for the future. \nThat is still not without risk for the people involved.\nAt the end of each section an official report will be published which may well attach blame to institutions and to individuals.\nThose findings are likely to be seen by many as a historical verdict on the way the pandemic was handled.\nThey could even - theoretically - trigger future civil or criminal proceedings.\nIn a statement, a government spokeswoman said it was committed to learning lessons from the inquiry. \n\"Throughout the pandemic the government acted to save lives and livelihoods, prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and deliver a world-leading vaccine rollout which protected the nation,\" she added.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nCovid Inquiry: What have we learnt so far?\nWhat is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Gig safety fears after trainee stewards helped to cheat", "date": "2023-10-03 00:59:03", "text": "This video can not be played\nWATCH: Secret filming by BBC reporter\nSecurity guards - who safeguard public events - are fraudulently obtaining work licences after attending sham training courses, the BBC has found.\nAn undercover reporter from File on 4 paid extra to complete a mandatory six-day course in a day and a half - missing crucial first-aid training.\nOn one course he was told to fill in timesheets for all six days and given answers to multiple-choice questions.\nThe industry regulator said the evidence suggested criminality.\nThe Security Industry Authority (SIA) also said it was now working with the organisations which oversee these training companies to further investigate the BBC material. It said it would be referring the matter to the police. \nThe findings come eight years after another BBC investigation revealed security guards could be fraudulently buying qualifications for cash. \nThis time, File on 4 approached 12 companies offering Level 2 SIA door supervisor courses for between £200-£300. Many advertise near-100% pass rates and use phrases such as \"no pass, no fee\".\nFour of the firms offered the undercover journalist shortened courses - which is against regulations - ranging from one-and-a-half to three days.\nCompletion of the six-day training course lets people apply for an SIA licence - the blue cards seen on security staff armbands - subject to identity and criminal record checks. \nFile on 4: Security Threat\nA BBC reporter went undercover to reveal how some security training companies are providing fast-track courses that breach regulations and put the public in danger.\nListen on BBC Sounds\nThey can then work in arenas, nightclubs and other venues across the UK - renewing their licence every three years with a two-day top-up course. \nThere are nearly half a million active licensed security guards in the UK. About 170,000 qualifications - first-time and top-ups - are awarded each year, through close to 650 training providers. \nWhen presented with our findings, Paul Greaney KC - legal counsel to the inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing - told us he remained \"extremely concerned about the safety of the public attending events\".\nHe said the inquiry revealed that had the security staff received proper training it could have made a \"decisive difference\" to what happened - either averting the attack or aiding the injured. \nThe inquiry found a need for comprehensive training - with checks in place.\n\"What I've just seen is the complete opposite of that situation,\" he told the BBC.\nSteps Institution, in Forest Gate, east London, is one of the companies that offered the undercover reporter a shortened, fraudulent course.\nIt is an approved course provider and is listed on the SIA's website.\nFor an additional £310, the reporter was told he could begin his training on day five of the normal six-day course. This meant he missed a number of mandatory modules - including first aid, conflict management and door supervision.\nHe was first told to forge his timesheets for six full days, before joining others for a \"physical intervention\" training session - to learn how to safely move or restrain someone. \nThe reporter recorded course trainer, Zeeshan Ahmad, delivering anecdotes on painful ways to \"kill and be killed\". These are not part of the mandatory training.\nMr Ahmad told the BBC he unequivocally denied the allegations and said he was committed to \"upholding ethical standards in all aspects\" of his life. \nThe director of Steps Institution, Ms Adriana Ceteteanu, told us her company did not \"offer six-day courses in a day and a half\". The assertion of forged timesheets was \"incorrect\", and she did \"not accept\" that the instructor's method of training was inappropriate.\nAt a second training centre - Caetop College in Ilford, east London - there appeared to be no option to attend the mandatory six-day course, and our reporter was only offered a three-day course. \nAgain, in just a few minutes, he was asked to fill in timesheets for six days. He was then coached on a test which he should have taken at the end of a whole day of first-aid training.   \n\"That was first aid - so your first aid is finished now,\" the trainer told him.\nPaul Greaney told us he was \"extremely disappointed\" by our findings. A recommendation of better first aid training for security staff was one of the key issues to emerge from the Manchester Arena inquiry. \nOn the third day, the reporter and a roomful of other candidates sat a final exam - but they were not given any questions. Instead, answer sheets to multiple-choice questions were handed out and everyone was told by the trainer what options to circle - A, B, C and so on.\nOn some questions, candidates were told to vary their answers, to ensure each test paper was not identical when handed in.\nCaetop College is yet to respond to the BBC about this evidence. \nAfter the previous BBC investigation into security industry fraud in 2015, both the SIA and Home Office said they took allegations of malpractice seriously.\nBut after a File on 4 programme in January reported claims that staff at the O2 Brixton Academy regularly took bribes to let in ticketless music fans, the BBC was contacted by dozens of whistleblowers. \n\"People are passing the [course] who shouldn't be, and they are getting their licences,\" one told us. Another said they had worked with so many \"unsuitable\" people who were a \"danger to themselves and everyone around them\". The only reason they're able to work, said a third, is because the training company has \"somehow decided to pass them\".\nTwo people died as the result of a crush at the O2 Brixton Academy in December 2022.\nWhen told of the BBC's latest findings, the sister of one of the victims - security dog handler Gaby Hutchinson - said it was \"just not acceptable\" to put the public at risk. \nKelsey Hutchinson told us she found it difficult to understand \"how security companies can allow their workers to not have proper first aid [training]\".\nAn investigation into what happened at the Academy is ongoing. \nThe SIA - which was created by the Home Office in 2001 - refused to be interviewed about the latest BBC investigation, but said it would be assessing the evidence. \nWhere individuals' qualifications were shown to be unsafe, it said, licences would be suspended. The SIA also said it would work with Ofqual - which regulates qualifications, examinations and assessments in England - to ensure the allegations are investigated.\nThe statement added: \"We are determined to ensure poor practices are rooted out and support the majority who operate to good standards.\"\nOfqual said it took instances of fraud and malpractice seriously. \nIt said while it did not regulate training providers, it required awarding organisations to put safeguards in place to prevent malpractice. It also said those who did not take all reasonable steps to prevent malpractice faced sanctions. \nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nBrixton crush victim's family call for answers\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

Would-be customers can instead only \"enquire\" about them, and it is responding to enquiries with information about the recall.\nOther distributors of Onewheel electric skateboards in the UK have also been approached for comment.\nLast year, the CPSC urged people to stop using Onewheels. At the time, Future Motion objected and said they were safe \"when operated following basic safe riding principles common to any board sport\".\nIt said there was no reason for people to stop using their devices.\nIn a section of its website dedicated to the recall, Future Motion said it had \"an innovative new safety alert feature\" which some Onewheel owners could install via a firmware update in the coming weeks to make their devices safer.\nThe feature, named haptic buzz, is an alert that electric skateboard riders can \"hear and feel when experiencing certain situations that can result in a crash\", according to the firm's website.\n\"Haptic buzz is designed to work in conjunction with the existing pushback safety feature to help riders further recognize that the board's ability to balance may soon be exceeded so they can lean back and slow down to avoid crashing,\" it reads.\nHowever, it can only be used by customers with Onewheel GT, Pint X, Pint, and XR devices. \nThose with original Onewheel and Onewheel+ electric skateboards, which have since been discontinued, are instead entitled to a $100 (£82) credit towards a new device - which retail between $1,050 and $2,200.\nDo you own a Onewheel electric skateboard?

{"title": "Abercrombie & Fitch ex-CEO accused of exploiting men for sex", "date": "2023-10-02 16:00:17", "text": "The ex-CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch and his British partner face allegations of exploitation from men recruited for sex events they hosted around the world.\nA BBC investigation found a highly organised network used a middleman to find young men for the events with Mike Jeffries and Matthew Smith.\nEight men told the BBC they attended these events, some of whom alleged they were exploited or abused.\nMr Jeffries and Mr Smith did not respond to requests for comment.\nBut the couple's middleman denied any wrongdoing and said men went into these events \"with their eyes wide open\".\nAbercrombie & Fitch (A&F) - which also owns the Hollister brand - said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by the alleged behaviour.  \nTwo former US prosecutors who independently reviewed documents and testimony uncovered by the BBC have called for an investigation to determine whether charges for sex trafficking could be brought. Under US law, sex trafficking includes getting an adult to travel to another state or country to have sex for money by using force, fraud or coercion.\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of sexual acts\nOver two decades from the 1990s, Mike Jeffries transformed A&F from a failing heritage outfitter into a multi-billion-dollar teen retailer by selling sex appeal, with preppy all-American shirtless male store models and provocative billboards.\nOnce one of America's highest-paid CEOs, he was a controversial figure who faced claims of discrimination against staff, concerns about his lavish expenses and complaints about the unofficial influence of his life partner, Matthew Smith, inside A&F.\nIn 2014, Mr Jeffries stepped down following declining sales and left with a retirement package valued at around $25m (£20.5m), according to company filings at the time. \nThe BBC has now uncovered allegations that the fashion mogul exploited young adult men for sex at events he hosted in his New York residences and luxurious hotels around the world, including in London, Paris, Venice, and Marrakesh.\nAs part of a two-year investigation, the BBC has spoken to 12 men who described attending or organising events involving sex acts run for Mr Jeffries, 79, and his British partner Mr Smith, 60, between 2009 and 2015.\nThe eight men who attended the events said they were recruited by a middleman, who they described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. The BBC has identified him as James Jacobson.\nWatch Panorama's The Abercrombie Guys: The Dark Side of Cool, on BBC iPlayer now and on BBC One on Monday at 21:00 BST.\nListen to the podcast series, World of Secrets: Season 1 - The Abercrombie Guys, available on BBC Sounds from 21:00 BST.\nThe Abercrombie Guys: the Dark Side of Cool will be releasing in the US on October 6 on BBC Select, available to audiences via Amazon Prime Video Channels, the Apple TV app and The Roku Channel.\nThe BBC carried out extensive fact-checking of the men's testimonies, which bore a striking number of similarities.\nWe obtained documents - including emails, flight tickets and detailed travel itineraries - that supported key points of the men's accounts. We also interviewed dozens of other sources, including former household staff.\nHalf the men who told the BBC about their recruitment alleged they had been initially misled about the nature of the events or not told sex was involved. Others said they understood the events would be sexual, but not exactly what was expected of them. All were paid.\nSeveral told the BBC the middleman or other recruiters raised the possibility of modelling opportunities with A&F. All except one said they felt harmed by the experience.\nDavid Bradberry, then 23, said he was introduced in 2010 to Mr Jacobson by an agent who described him as the gatekeeper to \"the owners\" of A&F, but said there was no mention of sex. At their meeting, he said Mr Jacobson suggested Bruce Weber - then A&F's official photographer - should take his picture. \nThen, Mr Bradberry said, \"Jim made it clear to me that unless I let him perform oral sex on me, that I would not be meeting with Abercrombie & Fitch or Mike Jeffries.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Signing an NDA \"felt like intimidation\" - David Bradberry\n\"I was paralysed,\" he said. \"It was like he was selling fame. And the price was compliance.\" Mr Bradberry said he had been made to believe \"this is where everybody gets their start\". He recalled that Mr Jacobson gave him $500 and told him it was for his time.\nLooking back, he said this incident should have been \"a red flag\" but he thought Mr Jacobson \"was just a creepy old dude that I wouldn't have to see again\". \nMr Bradberry accepted an invitation to a daytime event at Mr Jeffries' former home in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island - recently sold for $29m. He said he understood Mike Jeffries was a \"powerful man\" who could \"make his career\". Ahead of the event, he said Jim told him to buy an outfit with some A&F gift cards, which he said made it feel \"legitimate\" and \"official\".\nAt the Hamptons, Mr Bradberry said he spoke to Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith about his aspirations to be an A&F model. Later, he said, Mr Jeffries held \"poppers\" under his nose - a drug which can cause a strong head-rush and disorientation - and later had sex with him.\nMen who attended these events told the BBC Mike Jeffries and Matthew Smith would engage in sexual activity with about four men or \"direct\" them to have sex with each other. Afterwards, the men said staff at the event handed them envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in cash.\nMr Bradberry said the \"secluded\" location and presence of Mr Jeffries' personal staff, dressed in A&F uniforms, supervising events meant he \"didn't feel safe to say 'no' or 'I don't feel comfortable with this'\".\nThe BBC investigation also uncovered details of the \"well-oiled machine\" organising sex events for Mr Jeffries, in which:\nDomestic staff who worked in Mr Jeffries' former Hamptons home told the BBC events were held there regularly at weekends. Some said they were instructed to leave the premises every Saturday afternoon for several years, leading them to believe something strange was taking place. One former staffer said he understood it was because his boss was having \"playtime\".\nBarrett Pall, a former model turned life coach and activist, said he felt pressured into attending an event in the Hamptons in 2011. Then 22, he said he was recruited by an older model, who received a referral fee, to be his \"replacement\" for \"some sort of sexual experience\" with the couple. \nHe said he felt obliged to comply as the older man had been supporting him financially and he felt indebted. Like the other men, he said initially he attended a \"test run\" with Mr Jacobson.\nMr Pall said the older model told him that \"you don't have to do anything you don't want to do\" but suggested that \"the further you go, the better\", and alluded to career opportunities. When he arrived at the event, he said he felt under pressure to \"perform\". \"How was I going to leave? I didn't have a car,\" he said. \"I had a chaperone sitting and watching me.\"\nMr Pall said one of the other men recruited for the event performed oral sex on him as Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith watched. He said the couple then encouraged him to come over to the bed and kiss Mr Jeffries. Later, two other men recruited for the event had sex with the A&F boss and his partner, he added. At one point, Mr Pall said Mr Jeffries was behind him, groping him.\n\"This experience, I think it broke me,\" he said. \"I think that this stole any ounce of innocence that I had left. It mentally messed me up. But with the language I now have today, I can sit here and tell you that I was taken advantage of.\"\nThe largest event described to the BBC was hosted in a private villa at a five-star hotel in 2011, for which dozens of men were flown to Marrakesh. The BBC understands Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith had also invited friends. Alex - who asked for his name to be changed to protect his identity - said he was a struggling model supporting his family back home when he was recruited as a dancer for the event, where he expected he would have to strip. \nMr Jeffries \"took advantage of people in a very vulnerable point in their life, especially when they're around these big cities, coming from small America,\" Alex said. The former CEO was the \"kingpin\", he said. \"If it wasn't for him none of this would have existed.\"\nAlex, a straight man then in his 20s, said he was auditioned by Mr Jacobson, who praised his dancing but demanded he \"finish the job\" by performing oral sex on him. \"I had debt, I wanted to support my family,\" said Alex. \"I performed the job and I was, like, disgusted.\"\nThinking \"the hardest part was out of the way\", Alex flew to Marrakesh for the event a few weeks later. But moments into his dance, he said, Mr Jeffries tried to kiss him. \"I was trying to be in it without offending him. I was extremely uncomfortable,\" Alex said.\nEventually, he said he went to hide in a back room where he fell asleep. Alex said he woke up with a condom inside him and feared that the champagne he had been given earlier had been spiked. \n\"When I put things together, I believe there is a very good possibility I was drugged and raped. I'll probably never, never know for sure the answer of what happened,\" he said.\nSome of the men, including Alex and Mr Bradberry, said they attended more than one event, having been convinced by Mr Jacobson that the next time would be easier or hoping they would eventually be offered modelling work so \"it all meant something\".\nThese events \"directly affected my self-esteem\", said Mr Bradberry. \"My twenties were filled with anguish and struggle, anxiety, depression.\" But he said he now lives a quieter life, \"full of hope\".\nBrad Edwards, a civil lawyer who examined the BBC's evidence, said US prosecutors should investigate whether what these \"brave men\" describe could be sex trafficking. \nMr Edwards said: \"There may have been evidence of coercion for some of the men, whereas others might not have felt the coercive tactics. \n\"Remember, coercion is the reasonable belief that serious harm will be inflicted - and serious harm could be reputational harm, financial harm, physical harm.\" \nMr Edwards also said Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith might argue the men were consenting adults and the fact that some had engaged in commercial sex in the past was \"a factor\", although he said past actions were \"really irrelevant\" to whether a particular commercial sex act was due to force, fraud or coercion. \nHe said there was a \"very high\" burden of proof for prosecutors, however.\n\"Given the stories of these brave men that have come forward, I think it's very important that federal prosecutors look into this case,\" he said.\nElizabeth Geddes, who was a federal prosecutor for more than 15 years and also reviewed our findings, said: \"There's certainly an argument that these young men were subjected to potential coercion. I think there are grounds for a prosecutor to open an investigation and look closely at this conduct to determine if a criminal prosecution is warranted.\"\nMr Jacobson - the middleman, now aged 70 - said in a statement through his lawyer that he took offence at the suggestion of \"any coercive, deceptive or forceful behaviour on my part\" and had \"no knowledge of any such conduct by others\".\nHe said he did not recall making promises of modelling opportunities. \"Any encounter I had was fully consensual, not coercive,\" he said. \"Everyone I came into contact with who attended these events went in with their eyes wide open.\"\nThe BBC made repeated attempts by letter, email and phone, over several weeks, to contact Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith, inviting them to respond to a detailed list of allegations to ensure they were fully aware of the claims against them. They have not responded.\nA&F, which has said it considers Mr Jeffries its modern-day founder, told the BBC it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by his alleged behaviour. It said new leadership has transformed the company into \"the values-driven organisation we are today\" and it has \"zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind\".\nYou can follow Rianna on X, formerly Twitter\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?

{"title": "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples", "date": "2023-10-02 21:07:33", "text": "When Aki and Hikari were looking to rent a house together in Tokyo, they were told by real estate agents that the places they liked \"were for couples\". \n\"We are a couple,\" they would respond. The answer they were given: \"This is a house for a man and woman couple.\"    \nThe women, both in their 30s, have been together for seven years - now they are mothers to a baby. They coo and fuss over the infant, swap feeding and nappy-changing duties, and take turns to stay with him so one of them can get some sleep. They can't stop talking about their new baby formula machine.  \nYet, in the eyes of the law, the government and a conservative Japanese society, they're not a legitimate couple. Despite the support around them, they have kept their relationship a secret from many people. It's why they don't want to reveal their real names. They say they are being extra-cautious for their son given that taboos around same-sex couples still persist.\n\"We're not recognised as a family of three,\" Aki says.   \nJapan is the only G7 country not to fully recognise same-sex couples or offer them clear legal protection, leaving the country's LGBTQ+ community feeling vulnerable and nearly invisible.  We've changed Aki and Hikari's names to protect their identities.\nPressure has been growing to legalise same-sex unions after several district courts ruled that a ban on them was unconstitutional. But Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has struggled to pass reforms in the face of opposition from traditionally-minded political leadership.\nThere has been some progress in a nod to younger, louder voices demanding change. Some municipalities have introduced partnership certificates, but they are not legally binding. A new government post that mainly focuses on LGBTQ+ rights has been created, and a new law targets discrimination against sexual minorities. \nBut the community is disappointed because the law, which met stiff opposition from conservative lawmakers, stops well short of recognising marriage equality. \nActivists were also infuriated because of language in the bill which said that in taking measures to \"promote understanding\" of sexual minorities, \"all citizens can live with peace of mind\". \nIt drew angry reactions from critics who say it prioritised the rights of the majority, and implied that the existence of the LGBTQ+ community could be a threat to others' peace of mind.  \n\"There are already many politicians that want to use this law as a deterrent to restrict education and activities at schools and companies - so I'm very afraid of those intentions,\" says Akira Nishiyama, deputy secretary general of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation.\nSame-sex couples like Aki and Hikari say the lack of legal recognition is far from an abstract concern - it makes life harder for them every day.\nOne of the things they are struggling to get used to, for instance, is the fact that only Aki, who gave birth, has parental rights. \"When I gave birth, I wrote a will to appoint my partner as our son's legal guardian in case I died during labour. And even that didn't guarantee her custody,\" Aki says. \nIf one of them is hospitalised, the other has no legal right to fill paperwork or sign consent forms on her partner's behalf. Many couples cannot get a joint mortgage to buy a house. And if one partner dies, the other has no right to inherit. \nThey could apply for special permissions to circumvent each of these circumstances, but the decision depends on the discretion of officials. \nIt was parenthood that encouraged Hikari and Aki to come out to their families and their close circle of friends, and to consider marriage.  \nThey wanted their son to be able to explain his mothers' relationship when he grows up. They knew they couldn't get married in Japan, but they filled out a marriage application anyway. \nWhen their application was rejected in Japan, they got married in Canada where Hikari went to university.  \n\"We wanted to show we exist,\" Aki says. But in Japan, she says she and Hikari feel like they are being made invisible.\n\"I grew up in a small, conservative town,\" Aki says. \"I knew I was gay from a young age and felt strongly that I had to fix it. I lived in hiding… I've given up so much. I don't want to do this anymore.\"\nThere is room for progress, Ms Nishiyama says, but those in power are strongly resistant to change: \"Conservative politicians who want to protect the idea of traditional family… or the patriarchy.\"\n\"I have been actively working for the protection of LGBTQ+ people for almost 10 years - that's why I'm really frustrated because I feel that I need to really fight and I need to work hard every single day. I could live in other countries where LGBTQ+ people's rights are protected by law, but I have not chosen that path yet because I want to change Japanese society and I want to protect my own rights.\" \nShe says she will never stop fighting, but she is also exhausted and disheartened by the meagre progress.\nOlder gay couples are more hopeful. Keitaro and Hideki met at a ballet class more than a year ago and have been inseparable since then.  \nThey were excited to get a partnership certificate. Even though it gives them no legal protection, they see it as a symbol of their union.  \"A true bond is beyond legal marriage.  If you find one, it matters less how society labels it,\" Keitaro said. \nNow in his early 40s, Keitaro came out when he was a teenager and has since lived openly as a gay man. \nHideki, who's 10 years older, has not come out to his family. He lives in a conservative rural area near Tokyo and commutes regularly to see his partner - he doesn't want to shock his 90-year-old mother whom he takes care of often. \n\"I think that discrimination is still very strong in Japan, as is the environment that surrounds me,\" Hideki says.\n\"I wish that more people would not have to live a double life,\" Keitaro says. \"I think [legal protection] matters, if there's recognition... and less prejudice people will feel safe to come out.\"   \nAnd that's what Aki and Hikari want too - they are hopeful that one day they'll be legally married in Japan and their son will be at their wedding.  \nThey worry for their child and wonder how he will navigate school and society. Aki says that's why she wants more not just for her family, but for others like them.  \n\"Our wish is to have a society which is easier to live in for children of same-sex parents,\" she says. \"We want LGBTQ people to be protected, now and in the future. It is not right that we keep hiding ourselves.\"  \nGay couples sue Japan over marriage rights\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "15 minute cities: How they got caught in conspiracy theories", "date": "2023-10-03 10:16:20", "text": "Conspiracy theories linking \"15-minute cities\" to sinister ploys to control people may once have been the preserve of fringe groups on social media, but have they now entered the mainstream of British politics?\nSpeaking at the Conservative Party conference on Monday, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he was \"calling time on the misuse of so-called '15-minute cities'\".\nOriginally an urban planning concept, the \"15-minute city\" idea is aimed at providing people in cities with basic services within a quarter of an hour's walk or bike ride of where they live.\n\"There's nothing wrong with making sure people can walk or cycle to the shops or school,\" said Mr Harper. \"That's traditional town planning.\"\n\"What is sinister and what we shouldn't tolerate is the idea that local councils can decide how often you go to the shops and that they ration who uses the roads and when, and they police it all with CCTV.\"\nBut this is not an accurate characterisation of \"15-minute cities\". \nThey do not give councils special powers to restrict people's freedom of movement. And, while they are meant to reduce car traffic, they do not stop people from using other forms of transport.\nMr Harper did not respond to the BBC's requests to clarify his comments, which appear to echo conspiracy theories about sinister plots linked to the concept of \"15-minute cities\". \nHis speech follows government plans to \"back drivers\" by preventing councils from enforcing schemes that \"aggressively restrict\" where people drive. \nThe creator of \"15-minute cities\", urban planner Carlos Moreno, issued a statement later on Monday calling on the government to reconsider its stance.\n\"Associating the '15-minute city' again with so-called 'liberty-restricting' measures is tantamount to aligning with the most radical and anti-democratic elements,\" he wrote.\nThe idea behind \"15-minute cities\" is everyone lives within a 15 minute walk or bike ride from all basic services we need - be it schools, clinics, or parks.\nThe ultimate goal is to reduce traffic, but also emissions that are driving global warming. \nBut critics argue that cars remain central to many people's livelihoods and it is still virtually impossible for many to access alternative forms of transport. \nSeveral councils have incorporated \"15-minute cities\" into their policy plans, including Canterbury, Ipswich, and Bristol.\nOnline conspiracy theories have blossomed around the topic - many claim the schemes are designed to control the population and trap them in their homes.\nHowever, no council is planning to stop people from travelling beyond the 15-minute radius. Instead, the aim is to provide more essential services within a short distance of people's homes.\nTelegram channels devoted to spreading conspiracy theories around Covid-19 or the war in Ukraine have frequently spread false claims around the concept, linking it to all-encompassing conspiracy theories like the \"Great Reset\".\nEven before last week's government announcement, it was still possible to find hundreds of posts on other platforms pushing false claims around \"15-minute cities\".\nIt was in Oxford where this idea truly sparked a misinformation storm.\nLast November, Oxfordshire County Council approved the creation of traffic filters, enforced through cameras in six key locations. \nPrivate cars would not be allowed through without a permit (which they could use up to 100 days per year), but all other vehicles would be exempt - to incentivise the use of public transport and cycling.\nThe BBC understands that Oxford was one of the places Mr Harper had in mind when he spoke of councils that \"ration who uses the roads and when\".\nBut, while some people may find this \"controlling\", it is definitely not the same as a \"15-minute city\".\nThe traffic filters scheme attracted significant opposition from people worried about the impact the measures might have on their mobility and livelihoods.\nBut online, a separate conversation appeared to be taking place - one that tapped into genuine grievances against the trial, blending them with rumours pushed by far-right blogs and fringe media outlets around the world.\nOn social media, some users suggested this was part of a sinister plot to confine people to their local areas for the sake of the environment.\nOthers wrongly linked the traffic filters scheme to a separate council proposal to introduce 15-minute neighbourhoods in Oxford.\nOxfordshire County Council publicly dismissed claims suggesting a link between the two, as well as the claim that traffic filters will be used to confine people to their local area.\nBut soon the social media frenzy also began having a real impact offline: councillors received death threats. Others were faced with anxious questions from residents.\n\"People have come up to me and said: is it true that we're not going to be allowed out of our houses, that it's going to be just like the coronavirus lockdown?\", Emily Kerr, from Oxford City Council, told the BBC at the time. \nLeafletting campaigns accusing councils of treating people like guinea pigs were organised. \nSoon enough, council meetings in other parts of the country were being interrupted by protesters.\nAs false claims spread online, the subject was briefly raised in Parliament.\nIn February, Nick Fletcher, Conservative MP for Don Valley, asked the government to hold a debate on what he described as \"the international socialist concept of so-called 15-minute cities and 20-minute neighbourhoods\", which he said \"will take away personal freedoms\".\nIn response, the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, said that \"where such policies are brought forward, local communities ought to be properly consulted\".\nSpeaking to Radio 4's PM programme, the minister for Nuclear and Networks, Andrew Bowie, appeared to agree with Mr Harper:\n\"This is coming up in discussions on door-steps up and down the country, it's coming up in discussions forums, online\"\n \"People are concerned and we need to address those concerns.\"\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nWhy were Oxford residents called 'guinea pigs'?\nLockdown conspiracy theory leads to death threats in UK city\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Uttar Pradesh: Indian schoolgirl’s cycling death lays bare ugly face of ‘Eve-teasing’", "date": "2023-10-02 21:12:31", "text": "The tragic death of an Indian schoolgirl has laid bare the consequences of \"Eve-teasing\" - a popular South Asian euphemism which many say trivialises the street harassment and assault of women.\nThe short CCTV video of two Indian girls riding bicycles starts off quite innocuously. \nDressed in their school uniform - tunics, salwar bottoms and scarves - the teenagers are riding side by side on a near-empty road.\nBut within seconds, the calm of the scene is shattered. \nTwo men on a motorbike overtake them and one of them pulls away the scarf of one of the girls. Immediately she loses her balance and her cycle moves right and collides with a second motorbike coming from behind. \nAs she and the riders fall on the road, the 17-year-old is run over by a third motorbike coming from the opposite direction.\n\"The moment I saw my daughter, I knew she was dead,\" says her father Sabhajit Varma, who arrived at the scene within minutes after receiving a call from his niece - the other girl in the CCTV footage.\n\"Some people had gathered and we loaded her onto a tempo [a small vehicle used to transport goods] and rushed to a hospital,\" he told me on the phone from his home. \n\"Doctors said she was 'brought dead'. They said her jaw was shattered and she had died from severe injuries to her head,\" he said. \"There were no last words, no goodbyes.\"\nMr Varma's wife died eight years ago and after his two older daughters were married, the 17-year-old, the youngest of three, was the only one living with him. She was good at studies and wanted to be a doctor, he tells me. \nTwo days before her death, he said, she'd told him that some boys had been harassing her and other girls outside their school. Since then, his niece and other students have also told police that the young men used to hover around their school morning and evening, sometimes racing their bikes.\nHis daughter's death has left Mr Varma heartbroken and angry. \"My daughter was murdered. The men who killed her must be hanged,\" he says. \nThe incident took place last month in Ambedkar Nagar district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. \nPolice have arrested three suspects - reports say at least one of them is a minor - and are looking for a fourth man. Since the tragedy, Mr Varma says, he's been visited by government officials, including a minister in the state, but not received any compensation.  \nAfter the footage of the incident went viral on social media and made headline news, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath warned those who harassed women on the streets that \"Yamraj [the Hindu god of death] would be waiting for them at the next traffic crossing\". \nAnd within hours, police said they had shot and injured two of the suspects in their legs \"as they tried to snatch our weapons and run away while being taken for their medical examination\". The third man, they added, had fractured his leg trying to run.\nThe families of those arrested have denied that their sons were involved in the crime - they insist that their boys are not those seen in the viral CCTV footage and accuse the police of shooting and injuring them in staged encounters. Police, however, say they have fast-tracked the case and expect a judgement in a month.\nThe tragic death of the schoolgirl has put the spotlight on the issue of sexual harassment of women in public places - with some women's rights activists also questioning the use of the phrase \"Eve teasing\" by the local press to describe the case. \nThe term, they say, is \"deeply problematic\" and point out that recently, the Supreme Court also flagged it, saying it should be replaced with \"street sexual harassment\" in courts.\nKalpana Viswanath, co-founder of Safetipin, a social organisation working to make public spaces safe and inclusive for women, says the term makes it sound like it's just a bit of teasing, but it's not benign.\n\"It's a typical Bollywood trope that the hero pursues the woman and she likes to be pursued. But it's a criminal offence, it's violent, and let's not minimise the harm of violence by calling it Eve-teasing, let's no trivialise it\" she says.\nAs most Indian women would testify, Eve teasing is very common and happens often while a woman is walking on the road or travelling in crowded public transport - most would have a story or two to tell about when they were groped or pinched or elbowed in the chest.\nMost cases of such harassment are registered under Article 354 of the Indian penal code which deals with cases of \"attempt to outrage modesty of women\". \nBut in the Ambedkar Nagar death case, police have invoked other stringent charges as well. \nIn 2021, the last year for which the Indian government's crime data is available, police recorded almost 90,000 such cases - or 13.4% of the total 428,278 crimes against women that year. With the backlog built up over the years, more than half a million such cases were pending in courts, according to the data.\nBut street harassment is a highly under-reported crime because most women don't go to the police when someone touches or gropes them or passes lewd remarks, Ms Viswanath says. Also, sometimes, especially in a very crowded area, it may be difficult even for a woman to identify her molester. \nThe incident in Ambedkar Nagar, she says, has made news only because of the tragic outcome. \"If she hadn't died, if she got up after falling down, dusted herself off and walked away, no-one would have talked about this incident.\"\nThe issue of harassment, gender activists say, can only be addressed by bringing up better boys. But, Ms Viswanath says, that's a long-term process and \"in the meantime, there has to be a better messaging system in the media which, at the moment, is laden against girls\". \n\"People need to understand what's acceptable behaviour, the police have to be sensitised so they take complaints from women seriously.

{"title": "The Papers: 'Tory rebellion' as Sunak 'brings axe down on HS2'", "date": "2023-10-03 05:13:09", "text": "The Times reports that Rishi Sunak is likely to announce the scrapping of HS2 from Birmingham to Manchester, in his party conference speech tomorrow. The Guardian says an emergency Cabinet meeting will be held at the conference to approve what it calls \"the biggest infrastructure climbdown in a generation\". The i reports Northern Powerhouse Rail links to Liverpool and Hull may also be at risk because its construction is reliant on parts of HS2. Meanwhile the Daily Mail quotes a Conservative source as saying Mr Sunak is \"ready to have the argument\" about the issue, as he is making sure the government is not just \"throwing good money after bad\".\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that Health Secretary Steve Barclay will announce plans to ban transgender women from female hospital wards in England. Under the changes, trans patients would be housed in separate accommodation to bring back what Mr Barclay describes as a \"common sense\" approach to sex and equality within the NHS. The paper says he also plans for a return of \"sex-specific\" language - expelling terms such as \"chestfeeding\" instead of \"breastfeeding\", and guidance referring to pregnant \"people\" rather than women.\nThe Times says police could soon be given full access to Britain's passport database, to help catch thieves and shoplifters. It quotes Crime and Policing Minister Chris Philp as saying footage from CCTV or doorbell technology would be compared against facial images to help officers find a match \"at the click of a button\". The Guardian says civil liberties groups have described the plans as \"authoritarian\". It quotes one campaign group warning it would be \"Orwellian\" to have police scan people's faces and trawl through their personal information as they go to buy a pint of milk. \nThe Financial Times says that the head of the IMF has backed reforms that could give Beijing more voting power in the fund. In an interview, Kristalina Georgieva tells the paper the institution should represent changes in the global economy - which include the rise of China. The country has been criticised by creditors for hampering debt relief deals - and the paper says the US - the IMF's largest shareholder - has signalled it would veto an expansion of Beijing's voting rights.\nThe i reports that up to 200,000 people will be regularly tested as part of a major Covid study aimed at tracking the spread of the virus this winter. It says the survey will involve 32,000 lateral flow tests a week being sent out to volunteers. The study - led by the UK Health and Security Agency and the Office for National Statistics - will run from November to March, and operate in a similar way to a previous ONS study which was scrapped. \nAnd the Mirror carries a study about how daily tea drinkers could be reducing their chances of developing Type-2 diabetes by 28%. It quotes the findings from Adelaide University but points out a weakness - most in the study drank a healthier type of Chinese \"dark tea\" rather than the black tea with milk that Britons consume. Nevertheless, the paper claims there's \"Diabe-TEAs hope\".\nDaily Express\nDaily Mail\nDaily Mirror\nDaily Star\nDaily Telegraph\nFinancial Times\nGuardian\nIndependent\nMetro\nMorning Star\nSun\nTimes\nThe i\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Why a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire", "date": "2023-10-03 01:22:38", "text": "A gun charge hanging over President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is rarely filed by prosecutors. Will it stand up in court?\nPatrick Darnell Daniels was pulled over by police in April 2022 for driving a truck without a registration plate in Hancock County, Mississippi. \nInside his vehicle officers found marijuana cigarette butts and two loaded firearms. \nThe 26-year-old was charged under a law that bans users of illegal drugs from owning guns. \nA judge denied him bail and ruled him a flight risk, citing a previous contempt of court, a history of substance abuse and a lack of stable residence. \nHe was convicted and sentenced last October to nearly four years in prison.\nBut in August an appeals court overturned Daniels' conviction. He was freed on 26 September.\nHunter Biden, 53, faces the same charge: possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of a controlled substance. It carries a maximum prison sentence of up to five years. He is expected to plead not guilty on Tuesday. \nSouth Texas College of Law Professor Dru Stevenson, who has published research on drug-user-gun-possession charges, says it's unusual for such cases to make it to court. \n\"It's just really rare that they would go after someone and prosecute them for this,\" Prof Stevenson said. \n\"But this [Hunter Biden] is a high-profile person and there's been members of Congress demanding he be prosecuted.\"\nOf the 7,454 people sentenced for illegal gun possession in 2021, only about 5% of them were charged due to drug use, according to US Sentencing Commission data. \nAs well as the drug-user-gun-possession charge, Mr Biden faces two felony counts of lying about his drug addiction in a statement to a firearms dealer and on a federal form when he bought the revolver in October 2018 from a shop in Wilmington, Delaware. The twin charges are punishable by up to 10 years each.\nPart of the reason the drug-user-gun-possession charge is so rare, Prof Stevenson said, is that it can be hard to prove someone is a drug user and has a gun.\nThe president's son, however, wrote about his addiction to crack cocaine during the period of his life when he bought the pistol in his 2021 memoir Beautiful Things.\nFor those who do end up charged with illegal gun possession, it's usually a \"slam dunk case\", Prof Stevenson said. \n\"If they insist on pressing charges,\" he said, \"I don't think there's any question that [Mr Biden] will be convicted.\" \nThe president's son - who is also under investigation for allegedly failing to pay federal taxes - has remained free while his case winds its way through the courts. \nThe gun-and-tax charges were to be rolled in to a plea deal that would have spared Mr Biden - who has no criminal record - prison time. But that agreement collapsed in July.\nCongressional Republicans - who are investigating Mr Biden's business dealings, and how much his father might have known about them, called the plea agreement a \"sweetheart deal\".\nMr Biden's attorneys have predicted the first criminal case against the son of a US president will never make it to trial.\nThey have argued that the gun charges are unconstitutional, citing a Supreme Court ruling last year - New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v Bruen.  \nIn that decision, the justices expanded gun rights, writing that restrictions must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\".\nIn August the very same case was cited by the federal appeals court that overturned Patrick Darnell Daniels' conviction.  \nJudge Jerry Smith ruled: \"At no point in the 18th or 19th Century did the government disarm individuals who used drugs or alcohol at one time from possessing guns at another.\" \nOther cases involving the same drug-user-gun-owner prohibition - 18 USC 922 - have gone in favour of defendants after judges questioned whether the charges were constitutionally valid.\nPaola Connelly was arrested in El Paso, Texas, after police responding to reports of a disturbance found firearms at her home on 28 December 2021. \nMs Connelly was charged after acknowledging to officers that she often smoked marijuana as a sleep aid and to help her anxiety.\nBut in April a federal judge threw out the case.\nJared Michael Harrison was pulled over for failing to stop at a red light in Lawton, Oklahoma, in May 2022. \nHe, too, was charged after police discovered marijuana and a loaded gun in his car.\nBut in February, another court dismissed that case. \nHarrison's lawyer, Laura Deskin, told the BBC: \"I will say I cannot imagine Mr Harrison ever contemplated that anything in his life could possibly intersect with or impact Mr Hunter Biden. \n\"But here we are!\"\nHunter Biden to appear in court on gun charges\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East", "date": "2023-10-03 00:17:52", "text": "Eid Haddad's parents were teenagers when they witnessed the full force of Britain's presence in Palestine in 1938. \n\"They saw the troops coming in and attacking people. My father told me that one of the men was hit on his head with a wooden hammer used to mince meat called [in Arabic] a modakah, and he died,\" says Mr Haddad.\n\"A man and his son were hanging tobacco leaves to dry them. They were just shot in the back.\" \n\"It was chaos,\" he says. \nHis parents lived in al-Bassa, a Palestinian village subjected to collective punishment by British forces, who called their actions at the time \"punitive measures\". These would target whole villages if troops faced attacks by armed rebels operating in the hills. \nMr Haddad gave the account of the atrocity for a new BBC Radio 4 series, The Mandates, starting on Tuesday at 1600BST, which examines how British and French control of the Middle East a century ago shaped the region in ways which still reverberate today. \nIn the series we hear from a range of historians; experts in the events a century ago on the territory covering modern-day Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. We spoke to women and men directly affected by the convulsions that gripped Europe and the Middle East, and their descendants today. \nI first made contact with Mr Haddad last year when I was covering a Palestinian-led attempt to seek an apology for alleged war crimes carried out by the UK during its control of Palestine from 1917 to 1948. \nAs I spoke to him this time, during calls from his home in Denmark, he recounted the story of his own childhood in Lebanon amid the further bloodshed his family endured - by then dislocated from their homeland. \nLike many other people I interviewed for the series, his parents' early lives unfolded as British and French rule sparked years of conflict and sectarian upheaval in the region. \nHis childhood encapsulated the bloody instability that gripped the Middle East in the decades after the European powers abandoned their interventions. \nOne historian we interviewed told us the history of the mandates is so foundational it is effectively \"a history of the present\". \nDuring the First World War, as Britain invaded and captured the territory from the crumbling Ottoman Empire, it drew on growing forces of national self-determination. It made competing promises over swathes of the territory to Arabs, who sought independence across the region, and to the Zionist movement which sought a Jewish home in Palestine. \nThe British and French consolidated their control with so-called \"mandates\" to govern handed to them by the newly founded League of Nations - a body which was dominated by the two imperial powers. \nIn Palestine, Britain's policies ultimately set rival national movements on a collision course before it launched a brutal crackdown on an Arab uprising in the late 1930s. British forces would later face rebellion from Zionist militias, amid a series of chaotic policy reversals which saw the UK renege on immigration promises and turn back refugee boats of Holocaust survivors who had earlier escaped Nazi-occupied Europe.  \n\"The British didn't know how to manage these things,\" the Israeli historian Tom Segev told me. \"[They] treated Palestine as one would treat a lovable pet. It's nice to have, but it really shouldn't cause us too much trouble,\" he adds. \nMeanwhile the French Mandate hived off Lebanon from Syria to create a strategic beachhead and imposed new boundaries over the whole territory in the early 1920s, before an Arab rebellion which they also ruthlessly suppressed. They split areas by ethnicity and religion in what historian James Barr told us was a \"very straightforward and cynical\" attempt to divide and rule. \nIn the years after the Second World War, Britain and France pulled out. In Palestine, London knew its withdrawal would turn an escalating territorial conflict into regional war, as the State of Israel was declared and Arab armies invaded. \nMr Haddad's parents fled al-Bassa as the village was destroyed by Jewish paramilitary forces. During the conflicts of 1947-8 at least 750,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe'. Mr Haddad was born and grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in neighbouring Lebanon.\nThe fragile sectarian climate between Christians and Muslims left in the wake of French rule of Lebanon was destabilised with the addition of Palestinian refugees. It was further aggravated during the rise of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the armed group that launched attacks on Israel. The country also had powerful officials who still favoured regional pan-Arab alliance with Syria and Egypt - a movement which drew its roots back to rebellion against the mandates and earlier. \nLebanon later plunged into sectarian civil war. Mr Haddad, whose family are Palestinian Christians, describes how his 16-year-old brother was shot dead by Christian Lebanese ultranationalists - Phalangist militias - who targeted Palestinians and attacked his refugee camp north of Beirut in 1975. \nThe following year, he survived a mass killing, escaping gunmen by hiding in a wardrobe. He describes appalling and barbaric humiliation of survivors by the militias. \nMr Haddad tells me he manages lifelong symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which he traces back to what he experienced as a child. \n\"My parents - I think they also suffered PTSD because they have seen also lots of things as children. And imagine my father, he was about to be taken by the British troops to be interrogated,\" he says, explaining that British forces separated women from men who were detained by troops during the atrocity in al-Bassa in 1938.\nHis father, then a teenage boy, was spirited towards the line of women, says Mr Haddad, by a villager who disguised him as a girl.\n\"So they just covered him, covered his head with a scarf and gave him a dress. And in this way, they saved him from being tortured,\" he says. \nThe UK government has never acknowledged the atrocity in al-Bassa which is believed to have killed more than 30 people.\nFrom Europe, Mr Haddad describes how he has never been able to return home. \nHe says: \"It feels like a big piece of myself is missing. I feel just like an island in an ocean which is totally foreign to me.\"\nApology sought for British war crimes in Palestine\nSykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment\nHow one letter changed the Middle East\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Shavkat Mirziyoyev: Why is reformist Uzbek leader arresting bloggers?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:10:32", "text": "Olimjon Haydarov was detained and taken into custody in Uzbekistan's eastern city of Kokand in July, after being charged with extortion. \nThe YouTuber, whose videos focus on various social and economic issues, was charged with taking money from managers of a shopping centre by threatening to write an article exposing safety breaches at the facility. \nThe regional police department said that he had been caught red-handed while taking a bribe from the victims.\nUzbekistan refers to both bloggers and citizen journalists as bloggers.\nMr Haydarov faces a jail term of up to 10 years if found guilty. \nAnd he is not the only blogger being held. \nAbduqodir Mominov was detained on 8 February, also charged with extortion. He was convicted on 4 August and sentenced to seven years in prison.\nAnd in January this year, Khurshid Daliyev, the founder of the popular news outlet Human.uz, its chief editor Muslim Mirzajonov and several other journalists were detained after an office raid. \nUzbekistan's State Security Service, which is their national intelligence agency, later said that employees of the website were charged with blackmail and extortion. Their trials are being held in secret. \nCritics say these crackdowns have damaged Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's image as a reformer. \nSince coming into power, he has made significant headways in curbing child and forced labour, opening up the economy to foreign investment. \nBut his promise to bring in an era of free speech is in doubt. \nMr Mirziyoyev came into power in 2016, with an election campaign that relied heavily on both bloggers and social media. \nOn his campaign trail, he was constantly accompanied by a large group of bloggers. \nAt the beginning of his rule he endorsed a bolder, freer media.\nBut as the 66-year-old sets out on his third term in office, the recent string of arrests have stirred concerns. \nA number of Uzbek political commentators, writers and journalists have spoken in defence of Haydarov and others.\nEx-MP and public activist Rasul Kusherbayev said that he knew Haydarov personally and did not believe the charges against him. \n\"The criminal allegations against Olimjon are simply a hypothesis of a law enforcement body. Only time will show what actually happened, that is if we survive until that time comes and transparency is still there,\" Kusharbayev said.\n\"Activists are worried about various charges being brought against such individuals who actively use their right to free speech. Democracy cannot exist without this stratum of people who exercise freedom of speech and thought.\"\nOver the last few years, civil journalists have played a crucial role in Uzbekistan in pushing the boundaries of the limited media freedoms allowed by President Mirziyoyev's government.\nThough authorities did keep tabs on outspoken bloggers and arrested several social media figures - this was not widely perceived as a full-fledged crackdown on media freedoms, with many civil journalists continuing to voice the hope that those would be isolated cases.\nSocial media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Telegram also became focal points where Uzbeks were able to freely discuss and criticise policies. \nThis allowed bloggers like Haydarov to lead the public debate on thorny issues like corruption and nepotism in government bodies. Civil journalists, many of whom are also influencers, activists and political scientists, gained large followings.\nBut the latest arrests seem to have brought the realisation that authorities are truly on course to curb free speech.\nCivil journalists have been increasingly vocal of late about the president's failure to honour his promises, the stagnating economic reforms as well as growing oligarchy and nepotism. \nProminent political analyst Kamoliddin Rabbimov suggests that Haydarov's arrest is the latest \"alarming signal\" for civil society, warning that the arrests could prove a costly mistake and ruin Uzbekistan's efforts to improve its international image. \n\"In our country, where legal statehood has not yet been established and political pluralism has not been formed, it is possible to easily prove accusations against any blogger or journalist. But on the other hand, there is such a factor as the internal and external reputation of countries in the world,\" Mr Rabbimov said in an article posted on Kun.uz. \nMr Rabbimov believes that the Uzbek law-enforcement system had started sliding back into its Soviet past, with the security services now using the same methods as the Soviet KGB. \n\"We remember that we lived in a country where the NKVD [Soviet Union's secret police] and the KGB repressed the people… The spirit of the NKVD is alive. And attempts to revive it are very strong. If this institution gets restored, no one will be spared.\"\nUzbekistan media guide\nUzbekistan country profile\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Can tech stop India wasting so much of its harvest?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:15:38", "text": "Kapil Jain's father didn't want his children to be farmers.\n\"My father had seen the hardship which farmers go through, so we were all educated and moved to the city to pursue a profession,\" he says.\nBut Mr Jain become tired with life in the city, and in 2018 he moved back to his family farm, near Kota in Rajasthan, north India.\n\"I realised that I like the touch of earth and wanted to move back to the village and start farming,\" he says.\nHe didn't want to farm the same crops as his father - wheat, rice, mustard and soya beans.\nInstead, with his part of Rajasthan suffering water shortages, Mr Jain looked for a crop that would use less water.\nHe decided to experiment with roses, which grow well in sunny conditions and need relatively little water, compared with traditional crops.\nBut while the roses grew well, harvesting them and getting them to market proved a challenge. The roses had to be sold just hours after being picked, otherwise the petals begin to fall. \nTo meet peak demand the flowers had to be at the market at 05:00. While the market was only 20 miles away, the journey could take an hour. So the crop had to be picked between 02:00 and 03:00, which made finding workers difficult.\nAs a result of those challenges, Mr Jain lost around 70% of his first few crops.\nSomething had to change. So Mr Jain decided to turn his roses into rose water and rose oil.\nAlso, for his tomato crop he bought a solar-powered drying system. \n\"So now I dry my products and sell them in market at the same time as the rose water, rose oil and jams. They have a bigger market and shelf life and that will help me grow my business.\"\nGetting harvested produce to market in good condition is a problem that farmers all over India struggle with.\nAccording to government figures, in 2022 India lost between 6% and 15% of its fruit, between 5% and 12% of its vegetables, and between 4% and 6% of its cereals.\n\"Farmers throw away large amounts of fruits and vegetables because of a lack of infrastructure, limited processing capacity... natural disasters like cyclones, and floods that disrupt transportation routes and damage facilities,\" says Varun Raheja, founder of Raheja Solar Food Processing.\nMr Raheja points out that most Indian farms are small, without the resources to invest in storage or refrigeration. \nSo Mr Raheja developed a simple air drying system, which uses sunlight and solar-powered fans to dry the produce. It's cheap and easy to assemble.\n\"The DIY model of our solar dryer makes it portable and affordable, it can reach even the remotest village, and can be afforded by every small and marginal farmer,\" he says.\nHis firm has sold around 3,000 of the systems, which Mr Raheja says, on average, dry about 150kg of produce a month.\nMr Raheja also operates as a middle man, buying dried produce and selling them on to larger firms.\nIn contrast to Mr Raheja's low-cost, low-tech solution there is WayCool.\nThe Indian agri-tech firm works with 200,000 farmers, owns 412 distribution centres and has invested in sophisticated systems that forecast demand for agricultural products.\nAround 2,000 tonnes of fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, spices, dairy products flow through its network every day.\nWayCool says that its data analysis combined with modern distribution systems can help rescue some of India's lost produce.\n\"We employ technology to predict retailer orders, optimise collection centres, and set target prices, making supply chains efficient, and bringing supply chain losses to under 2%,\" says Karthik Jayaraman, managing director at WayCool Foods.\nWayCool has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build its network, and plans to be profitable by 2025.\nDespite such high and low-tech innovation, much work still need to be done to reach India's more remote farmers.\nSagar Lokhande farms 15 acres in the village of Bhendwad in Maharashtra state. He grows sugar cane because it has a long shelf life. Meanwhile tomatoes, green beans and vegetables are grown as cash crops.\nIn May he had a good crop of tomatoes and beans, but by the time his crops arrived at the market, trucks had arrived from all over Maharashtra and prices had dropped.\nBut without any storage facilities he was forced to sell at a loss. \n\"I grow green vegetables but cannot send it to cites as we don't have temperature control vans, and all the produce will get spoiled,\" says Mr Lokhande.\nNow he is investigating freezing his produce. \n\"I want to start selling frozen vegetables which have a longer shell life, especially beans which give a good price, so I will be able to repay all my loans and at the same time make more money.\"\nMore technology of business\nMarcella D'Souza is the director of the Centre for Resilience Studies, and has spent decades working with farmers in rural regions of India.\n\"It [technology] can bring in a lot of efficiency and effectiveness in planning, use of resources, decision making, coordination for several processes related to farming,\" she says.\nBut she says technology alone is not enough for Indian farmers.\n\"A holistic approach that looks at restoring natural ecosystems along with traditional knowledge, handholding support, credit and other factors are equally important for successful farming.\"\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

Prior to the laureates' breakthroughs, they effectively appeared as blurs under the most advanced microscopes - their movement and behaviour was too rapid to follow.\nEva Olsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said: \"We can now open the door to the world of electrons. Attosecond physics gives us the opportunity to understand mechanisms that are governed by electrons.\"\n\"Attosecond physics\" is bringing important processes inside atoms and molecules into sharper focus. The development is likely to lead to even more accurate electron microscopes, much faster electronics and new tests able to diagnose diseases at a much earlier stage. \nProf L'Huillier, who is based at Lund University in Sweden, is only the fifth woman to win a physics Nobel. On a line that dropped out briefly - and sounding somewhat dazed - she addressed the press conference at the Royal Swedish Academy. \n\"It's incredible,\" she said. \"There are not so many women that get this prize - so it's very, very special,\" she said. \nShe explained that the Nobel Committee had called three times before she answered the phone. \"I was teaching,\" she said, joking that the last half-hour of her lecture, after she found out, was \"quite difficult\".\nProf Pierre Agostini is based at Ohio State University in the US, Prof Ferenc Kraus is at Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany.\nThis video can not be played\nHow do you they pick a Nobel prize winner?\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, announced on Monday, was awarded to a pair of scientists who developed the technology that led to the mRNA Covid vaccines.\nProfessors Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman shared the prize.\nNobel Prize winners: 'I thought it was an anti-vaxxer prank'\nNobel rewards 'spooky science' of entanglement\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

He pointed out that the likes of Starbucks had managed to terminate its deal in the country and exit.\n\"Saying they [RBI] want to leave but then dragging their feet is not the same as actually exiting Russia, and by continuing to do business in Russia 18 months into Putin's invasion of Ukraine, they are sustaining Putin's regime,\" he said.\nThe spokesperson for RBI said the company was refusing new investment and supply chain support, and had not made any profits from Burger King in Russia since early 2022.\nMark Dixon, founder of the Moral Rating Agency, which campaigns against firms doing business in Russia, called for RBI to disclose what specific actions it had taken in its attempts to leave.\n\"[The firm] should be willing to break its agreement... It needs to accept the legal risk of doing the right thing.\"\nFranchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company that has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company that pays a fee for the right to do business under the brand and to sell its products.\nIt has been a tool used by many Western brands in recent decades looking to enter new markets in different countries. The agreements typically span many years.\nWhile Burger King remains open for business in Russia, its biggest rival McDonald's, which corporately owned most of its restaurants, has managed to leave the country.\nKFC's parent company Yum! Brands has also sold more than 100 restaurants to a local operator in Russia, which were rebranded as Rostic's in April.\nDavid Bond, partner at law firm Fieldfisher, said RBI's 15% stake meant it could not simply \"dictate terms\" to its fellow shareholders to require them to close Burger King branches.\nHe also suggested companies that franchise out their brands would be reluctant to simply walk away from deals as it could lead to \"dire consequences\", including being sued for breach of contract, as well as reputational damage.\nBut he said consequences aside, there was nothing stopping RBI from terminating the franchise arrangement if it was adamant it wanted to do so, though added it might not result in the Burger King brand ceasing to exist in Russia.\nHe said the majority of \"de-brands\" in the country, such as McDonald's, had been achieved through agreed sales with local businesspeople \"willing to de-brand in return for the discounted purchase price\".\nThe joint venture that holds the Burger King franchise in Russia is made up of RBI and three other parties:\nMcDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 years\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Meta: Can the firm's new headset stop virtual reality sickness?", "date": "2023-10-03 08:58:40", "text": "The first time I tried virtual reality (VR) I chose to play a rollercoaster game - and almost instantly regretted it.\nI suddenly felt sick, ripping off the headset but the nausea stayed with me for hours.\nIt was a rookie error. The disconnect between what my eyes saw and my body felt was too much.\nI've since discovered I can play gentler, less disorientating games, but the nausea still begins to creep in.\nSickness in VR affects a lot of people so finding a solution is critical if Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to create a \"metaverse\" that people actually want to spend time in is to be realised.\nThe boss of Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said last year that while motion sickness was still the \"biggest issue\" facing VR but claimed \"it is getting better\".\nSo it that true?\nMeta is set to launch its latest headset, the Quest 3 and, in the interest of research, I strapped it on and waited to feel sick.\nUnlike the last version, the Quest 3 has cameras that allow the user to see through the headset to the real world in full colour. \nIt means games can be played virtually but set in your physical surroundings. Think of a digital character sitting on your coffee table and you've got the idea.\nThis isn't the first \"mixed reality\" headset but it is the first affordable-ish one at $499 (£411).\nHappily, the nausea remained at bay.\nI started off with a showcase for the tech called First Encounters. \nIt began in the room I was standing in. As I shot projectiles, the walls crumbled, revealing a virtual world that I could peer into. Small green furballs began to jump at me. \nI could see people in the room as I was playing and see the walls. I could move around in my surroundings confidently. \nThe same held true as I tried Stranger Things - a mixed reality game version of the hit Netflix series. I didn't feel sick at all.\nChris Cox, chief product officer at Meta, said that mixed reality \"changes drastically how comfortable the [VR] experience is\". \nHis team knows \"context switches\" - from reality to VR - \"can be tough\". \nBut here's the thing: if the solution to solving VR sickness is to avoid playing full VR is that really a fix?\nMr Zuckerberg thinks motion sickness can be reduced with better graphics and less latency (the delay between doing something and seeing it on the headset).\nHe hopes that the better the headsets get, the fewer people will report problems. \nBut part of feeling ill is based simply on your eyes seeing things that the rest of your body isn't experiencing. \nSo I had a go at a completely virtual reality boxing game. I pulled the headset over my eyes, and suddenly my surroundings were gone.\nI played for a few minutes, punching imaginary targets. The graphics felt crisper - light-years ahead of earlier models. But for me, it was still not enough. \nI didn't feel sick, but an unwanted dizziness began to creep in, meaning my brain was still telling me that it is not enjoying the experience. \nAs Mr Zuckerberg acknowledges, people experience motion sickness differently. Some people get sea sickness, and some don't. \nSome people play VR for hours on end without a problem. But I can't. \nMixed reality is still very new, with few games. But maybe it is the solution for people like me who like the idea of playing games virtually - but haven't the stomach for it. \nMeta launches $7.99 a month virtual reality service\nMeta announces AI chatbots with 'personality'\nMeta to let parents limit teen virtual-reality use\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

But only a handful of hardline Republicans have indicated they are willing to remove Mr McCarthy.\nThe Speaker is second in the line of succession for the presidency after the US vice-president. He or she sets the lower house of Congress' legislative priorities, controls committee assignments, and can make or break the White House's agenda.\nThe deal late on Saturday that averted a government shutdown left out $6bn (£5bn) of funding for Ukraine because Mr Gaetz, of Florida, and other ultraconservatives insisted the US has spent too much on that country's war with Russia. \nMr Gaetz has wielded the threat of dethroning Mr McCarthy ever since January when he led party rebels in opposing the California congressman's bid for the speakership, forcing him to endure 15 gruelling rounds of voting in the chamber.\nDuring the political horse-trading before he ultimately won the gavel, Mr McCarthy agreed to a change of rules that would allow any single lawmaker to call for a vote to oust the Speaker.\nThat paved the way to the motion to vacate.\nIn a speech on the House floor on Monday, Mr Gaetz accused Mr McCarthy of striking a secret deal with the White House to insert new Ukraine funding into separate legislation.\nMr McCarthy has said there is \"no side deal on Ukraine\". \nAfter filing the motion to vacate, Mr Gaetz told a crowd of reporters: \"Well, I have enough Republicans where, at this point next week, one of two things will happen. \n\"Kevin McCarthy won't be the Speaker of the House, or he'll be the Speaker of the House working at the pleasure of the Democrats, and I'm at peace with either result, because the American people deserve to know who governs them.\"\nAsked earlier on Monday whether his actions were plunging the institution into turmoil, Mr Gaetz told reporters: \"You talk about chaos as if it's me forcing a few votes and filing a few motions. \n\"Real chaos is when the American people have to go through the austerity that is coming if we continue to have $2 trillion annual deficits.\"\nMr Gaetz told reporters outside the Capitol on Monday night that he would be up for supporting Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise - currently deputy to Mr McCarthy - to succeed the Speaker.\nTom McClintock, a California Republican, blasted the \"self-destructive course\" of trying to remove the Speaker, before Mr Gaetz's floor speech. \nWithout naming his Florida colleague, Mr McClintock said: \"I implore my Republican colleagues to look past their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests and their selfish views.\" \nAccording to the rules of the chamber, the Speaker is required to keep a list of individuals who could act as a temporary replacement in case the role is ever vacated. \nIf Mr McCarthy were voted out, this list would be made public and the person at the top of it would be named Speaker pro tempore until elections were held in the chamber for a new leader of the majority party in the chamber.  \nDemocrats must now decide if they will step in and vote to help the Speaker keep his job. \nDemocrats are unhappy with Mr McCarthy after he recently approved the launch of a congressional inquiry to see if there is enough evidence to impeach President Joe Biden.\nBut left-wing New York lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN on Sunday her fellow Democrats might be interested in politically bailing out Mr McCarthy if they can extract concessions from him.\nThe rare procedural tool to remove a Speaker has only been used twice in the past century and never successfully.\nIt was last used in 2015 against Speaker John Boehner.  \nThe motion to remove him failed but it built enough pressure on Mr Boehner that, unable to unite his caucus, he announced his resignation two months later. \nBefore then it was last used in 1910.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Defiant Trump turns up at $250m New York fraud trial to blast 'scam'", "date": "2023-10-02 22:59:02", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: Trump's New York fraud case explained... in 60 seconds\nFormer President Donald Trump has attacked a judge and prosecutor in a day of courtroom drama as he attended the opening of a fraud trial that could threaten his business empire.\nOn entering the room on Monday dressed in a blue suit, Mr Trump - who turned up voluntarily - looked ahead as he walked past the prosecutor who brought the case. \nState's attorney general Letitia James, sitting in the front row, averted her gaze. \nTheir paths did not cross for the rest of opening statements as both sides laid out their case.\nMr Trump, the Trump Organization, several executives and two of his children - Donald Jr and Eric - are the defendants in the civil trial in New York Superior Court. \nThey are accused of fraud, falsification of business records, issuing false financial statements and conspiracy.\nAs the trial got under way, the former president occasionally glanced in the direction of Judge Arthur Engoron as he addressed the court. \nMoments beforehand, in a tirade outside court that echoed across the chamber, Mr Trump had called the judge a \"rogue adjudicator\".\nMs James was not spared either in his remarks to reporters at the top of the courtroom steps.\n\"It's a scam, it's a sham. Just so you know, my financial statements are phenomenal,\" Mr Trump added. \"There was no crime - the crime was against me.\"\nGiven the former president's personal attacks, observers expected a tense atmosphere in the cramped confines of the court. But the three key figures in the legal drama had minimal direct interactions.\nWhile prosecutors set out their case, Mr Trump for the most part sat still, occasionally whispering to his legal team.\nMs James kept her eyes on the lawyer unveiling a visual presentation that accompanied her team's opening statements.\nProceedings began with her team accusing Mr Trump and his co-defendants of intentionally and persistently committing fraud, which reaped Mr Trump over $100m (£83m). \nLast week Judge Engoron ruled against Mr Trump in a central claim of the lawsuit, finding that he had overvalued his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars in order to get favourable bank loans.\nMr Trump's lawyers addressed the court shortly afterwards, attacking the New York attorney general's arguments. Alina Habba said Ms James' goal as attorney general was to \"go to work, get Trump and go home\". \nShe claimed that Mr Trump did not inflate the value of his assets - including his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\nReal estate was malleable, she said, and his properties were \"Mona Lisas\" - Mar-a-Lago would sell for at least a billion dollars, she argued.\nBut before lunch, proceedings turned increasingly fractious.\nMr Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, argued with Judge Engoron about issues including whether expert opinion counted as testimony. \nAnd Ms Habba's attacks on Ms James drew Judge Engoron's ire. The judge said he had already dismissed claims that the suit was politically motivated.\nThe afternoon in court proved calmer, with former Trump accountant Donald Bender testifying as the first witness called by the attorney general's office. \nMr Bender said he had worked on Trump's tax returns and completed accounting work for Mr Trump's corporate entities.\nHe testified in a criminal trial against the Trump Organization in Manhattan last year, claiming the company sought to evade taxes on bonuses and other luxury benefits. \nThis video can not be played\nTrump: 'It's a scam, it's a sham'\nHis two-hour testimony on Monday - largely focused on technical questions about his work for the Trump Organization - capped off the first day of the three-month long trial. \nThe case will be decided by Judge Engoron, not a jury. \nNone of the defendants will face jail time if convicted, because this is a civil case not a criminal one. \nMs James is seeking $250m (£207m) and sanctions that could prevent the Trumps from doing business in the state of New York.\nThere is even the possibility that Mr Trump could lose some of the properties that have become a signature part of his brand.\nThe stakes could not be higher.\nFact-checking Trump's claims about NY fraud trial\nWatch Trump tell reporters fraud trial 'is a sham' Video, 00:00:38Watch Trump tell reporters fraud trial 'is a sham'\nFive things to know about Trump's New York trial\nThe glitzy New York buildings that Trump could lose\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Oil cartel leader says demand expected to grow", "date": "2023-10-02 23:02:41", "text": "Demand for oil will continue to grow and remain \"resilient\" this year, according to the secretary general of Opec+.\nOpec+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries which decides how much crude oil to sell on the world market.\n\"We see demand growing about 2.4 million barrels a day,\" Haitham Al Ghais told the BBC.\nSaudi Arabia said it would be cutting its production of crude oil by a million barrels a day to boost prices.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia - two major oil producers and members of Opec+ - to cut production could cause a \"significant supply shortfall\" by the end of this year.\nMr Al Ghais said: \"This is a voluntary decision taken by two sovereign nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia. This decision can be described as precautionary or pre-emptive because of uncertainties\".\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market.\nBrent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies, with fears the price may breach $100 per barrel. The rise prompted a warning to drivers that fuel prices could rise in the coming 10 months, and stoked fears that inflation in key economies could be prolonged.\nBut Mr Al Ghais said Opec was more concerned about \"under investment\" in the oil sector.\n\"Some have called for stopping investments in oil. We believe this is equally dangerous. It will lead to volatility in the future, possible supply shortages. And therefore we at Opec have always advocated for the importance of continuing to invest in the oil industry as we also invest in decarbonising the industry and move on to adding other forms of alternative energy such as renewables\".\nAsked if he was concerned about rising oil prices affecting inflation around the world if it goes above $100 a barrel, Mr Al Ghais said it was \"important not to look at things in a short-sighted manner\".\n\"For next year we see demand continuing to grow north of 2 million barrels a day - of course, all subject to some of the uncertainties in the global market. Nevertheless, we still feel quite optimistic... that global oil demand is going to be quite resilient this year\".\nMr Al Ghais said that the oil industry would need close to $14tn in investment to the year 2045.\n\"Energy demand will grow by nearly 25% by the year 2045 compared to what it is today - and all forms of energy will be required\", he said.\nHis comments come ahead of a meeting of key oil players on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi for the International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC).\nOil prices rise as Saudi Arabia pledges output cuts\nWhy are the world's big oil producers cutting supplies?\nWarning over fuel prices as oil hits 10-month high\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nBurger King still in Russia despite pledge to exit\nTrump turns up in court to blast 'scam' fraud trial\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

Drafted by more than 250 Indigenous leaders, the statement is considered the best - though not unanimous - call to action for reforms on issues affecting First Nations Australians. It also lays out a longer process of treaty-making and truth-telling. \nBut the Voice proposal has become the subject of fierce debate in Australia, and a lightning rod for misinformation and racist abuse.\nIts supporters say it will lead to better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who face lower life expectancy, and disproportionately poorer health and education outcomes than other Australians.\nBut those against it argue - among other things - that the Voice is a largely symbolic gesture which will fail to enact change, and that it could undermine Australia's existing government structures.\nFor the referendum to succeed, a majority of Australians need to vote yes, but there also needs to be majority support in at least four of Australia's six states.\nThe composition, functions and powers of the body, whose advice would not be binding, would then be designed and debated by the parliament.\nRecent polling has shown a steady - yet dramatic - decline in public support for the Voice, but one poll on Tuesday showed the Yes side making ground for the first time in months.\nAustralia last held a referendum in 1999, when it rejected the opportunity to become a republic.\nOnly eight of Australia's 44 referendums have been successful - the most recent in 1977 - and none have passed without bipartisan support.\nWhat is Australia's Voice to Parliament referendum?\nLies fuel racism ahead of historic Australia vote\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

It's very scary\" she said. \nÓisín is now waiting to have the nasogastric tube removed and replaced by a different feeding system which goes directly to his stomach.\nCollette said she was told it could be a three-year wait for the procedure.\nShe is concerned that Óisín's cerebral palsy puts him at a greater risk of complications, saying she had been warned there was a danger he could aspirate.\n\"He could die. Anything going into his lung really, it could be very dangerous,\" she said.\nThe Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, where the specialist surgery is to be carried out, told Spotlight the wait should be no more than two years.\nIt apologised for the time Óisín has had to wait, adding that there was a limited number of paediatric surgeons who fit the tubes.\nIt said 75 children were currently waiting for the surgery.\n\"It is extremely difficult to prioritise these children based on clinical need due to the complex nature of their care plans\" the trust said. \nCollette told Spotlight Óisín is also waiting for surgery on his hip.\n\"His right hip is completely out of socket; it is just completely out,\" she said.\n\"Because this is out, then we have to match the two up together. It's not going to make him walk but it's to prevent pain.\n\"Pain will eventually come at some stage. Thank goodness it hasn't come yet.\"\nÓisín was placed on the list for this procedure last year but Collette said she had no idea when it was likely to be carried out.\nThe Belfast Trust said demand for such surgery was outstripping capacity, and that it was exploring options to alleviate waiting lists across paediatric orthopaedic services. \nBBC Spotlight also spoke to Taylor Clark, a 30-year-old former coffee-shop manager who has had to give up work due to poor mobility and severe pain.\nThe Bangor woman has Ehlers Danlos syndrome, which affects the tissues supporting her joints and muscles.\n\"The ligaments and tendons and muscle are all affected by that because they're not being held like a structure - they're sort of swimming around,\" she told the programme.\n\"I'm just in pain constantly - everything hurts.\" \nTaylor said she was referred for an outpatient rheumatology appointment two years ago.\nWhen she phoned in January this year to check her progress on the waiting list, she said she was told it could be approximately another six years.\nThe South Eastern Trust said it could not comment on individual cases.\nIn a statement the trust said it was \"very conscious that patients have to wait for a significant time to receive a first outpatient rheumatology appointment\" and that it understood the \"distress\" this could cause for patients.\nAs part of the programme, Spotlight brought together a panel of health experts to come up with ways to try and tackle Northern Ireland's waiting list crisis.\nThey included the former director of public health, Professor Gabriel Scally, health economist Professor Dame Carol Propper and former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board John Compton.\nThe panel agreed that more accountability within the health service was needed, along with the introduction of a performance management regime.\nIt also recommended greater involvement with the public and strong political leadership, which the experts said were all required to try to fix the current waiting list crisis.\nThe Department of Health told Spotlight that Northern Ireland's hospital waiting times were \"entirely unacceptable\" and had been \"made significantly worse by the pandemic\".\n\"Far too many people in our community [are] waiting far too long for assessment and treatment\" the department said.\nIt said a key component in tackling waiting times was a greater separation of elective care from urgent and emergency care.\n\"This ringfences staffing, bed capacity and theatre capacity for elective treatments, helping to increase the number of patients treated and reducing cancellations due to emergency cases,\" the department said in a statement.\nIt added: \"Reconfiguration of our hospital services is under way with the establishment of day procedure centres and elective overnight stay centres.\"\nSpotlight How Do We Fix Our Waiting Lists?

{"title": "Malaria vaccine big advance against major child killer", "date": "2023-10-02 14:40:58", "text": "A cheap malaria vaccine that can be produced on a massive scale has been recommended for use by the World Health Organization (WHO). \nThe vaccine has been developed by the University of Oxford and is only the second malaria vaccine to be developed. \nMalaria kills mostly babies and infants, and has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity.\nThere are already agreements in place to manufacture more than 100 million doses a year.\nIt has taken more than a century of scientific effort to develop effective vaccines against malaria. \nThe disease is caused by a complex parasite, which is spread by the bite of blood-sucking mosquitoes. It is far more sophisticated than a virus as it hides from our immune system by constantly shape-shifting inside the human body. \nThat makes it hard to build up immunity naturally through catching malaria, and difficult to develop a vaccine against it.\nIt is almost two years to the day since the first vaccine - called RTS,S and developed by GSK - was backed by the WHO. \nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said it was a moment of \"great pleasure\".\n\"I used to dream of the day we would have a safe and effective vaccine against malaria, now we have two,\" he said.\nThe WHO said the effectiveness of the two vaccines was \"very similar\" and there was no evidence one was better than the other. \nHowever, the key difference is the ability to manufacture the University of Oxford vaccine - called R21 - at scale. \nThe world's largest vaccine manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India - is already lined up to make more than 100 million doses a year and plans to scale up to 200 million doses a year.\nSo far there are only 18 million doses of RTS,S. \nThe WHO said the new R21 vaccine would be a \"vital additional tool\". Each dose costs $2-4 (£1.65 to £3.30) and four doses are needed per person. That is about half the price of RTS,S.\nThe two vaccines use similar technologies and target the same stage of the malaria parasite's lifecycle. However, the newer vaccine is easier to manufacture as it requires a smaller dose and uses a simpler adjuvant (a chemical given in the vaccine that jolts the immune system into action).\nIn 2021, there were 247 million cases of malaria and 619,000 people died, most of them children under the age of five. More than 95% of malaria is found in Africa. \nDr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: \"This second vaccine holds real potential to close the huge demand-and-supply gap. \n\"Delivered to scale and rolled out widely, the two vaccines can help bolster malaria prevention, control efforts and save hundreds of thousands of young lives.\"\nData that has been published online, but has not been through the usual process of scientific review, shows the R21 vaccine is 75% effective at preventing the disease in areas where malaria is a seasonal.\nThe WHO's strategic advisory group of experts said that figure was comparable to the first vaccine (RTS,S) in seasonal areas.\nThe effectiveness of malaria vaccines is lower in areas where the parasite is present all year round. \nProf Sir Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute in Oxford where R21 was developed, said: \"The vaccine is easily deployable, cost effective and affordable, ready for distribution in areas where it is needed most, with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives a year.\"\nGareth Jenkins, from Malaria No More UK, said: \"The reality is that malaria financing globally is far from where it needs to be and annual deaths from malaria rose during the pandemic and are still above pre-pandemic levels, so we cannot afford to be complacent as new tools are developed.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nMalaria vaccine is world-changing, say scientists\nGhana first to approve 'world-changer' malaria vaccine\nChance discovery helps fight against malaria\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

Astronomers are currently struggling to explain them.\nThe telescope observed about 40 pairs in a fabulously detailed new survey of the famous Orion Nebula.\nThey've been nicknamed Jupiter Mass Binary Objects, or \"JuMBOs\" for short.\nOne possibility is that these objects grew out of regions in the nebula where the density of material was insufficient to make fully fledged stars.\nAnother possibility is that they were made around stars and were then kicked out into interstellar space through various interactions. \n\"The ejection hypothesis is the favoured one at the moment,\" said Prof Mark McCaughrean.\n\"Gas physics suggests you shouldn't be able to make objects with the mass of Jupiter on their own, and we know single planets can get kicked out from star systems. But how do you kick out pairs of these things together? Right now, we don't have an answer. It's one for the theoreticians,\" the European Space Agency's (Esa) senior science adviser told BBC News.\nProf McCaughrean led the team that produced the new Orion survey.\nUsing JWST's remarkable resolution and infrared sensitivity, the astronomers have added substantially to the information already mined by older telescopes, including Webb's direct predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe Orion Nebula, also known by its sky catalogue name of M42, is the nearest, large star-forming region to Earth.\nAlong with the quartet of bright suns at its centre called the Trapezium, this region of space is visible to the naked eye as a smudge on the sky.\nIf you don't know it, it can be found low down in the constellation of Orion, which is named after a mythical Greek hunter. The nebula forms part of the hunter's \"sword\", hanging from his \"belt\".\nThe new JWST image is actually a mosaic of 700 views acquired by Webb's NIRCam instrument over a week of observations.\nTo give a sense of scale, it would take a spaceship travelling at light speed a little over four years to traverse the entire scene. The nebula itself is about 1,400 light-years from Earth.\nTucked away in this vista are thousands of young stars, spanning a range of masses from 40 down to less than 0.1 times the mass of our Sun.\nMany of these stars are surrounded by dense discs of gas and dust which may be forming planets, although in some cases, these discs are being destroyed by the intense ultraviolet radiation and strong winds from the most massive stars in the region, in particular from the Trapezium.\nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThe slider tool on this page shows the same nebula scene at shorter and at longer wavelengths. Using different filters in this way emphasises items of interest.\nLook at the longer wavelength version to examine the sculpted green clouds of gas that contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. PAHs are ubiquitous compounds in space produced by stars. \nLook also at the many-fingered red feature that dominates the background.\nKnown as the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 outflow, this is a mass of molecular hydrogen that has been shocked by the the immense energy streaming away from the site of a cataclysmic collision of two giant stars. The speed of the outflow at more than 100km/s indicates the star merger occurred just a few hundred years previously. \nNotice the fingertips are tinged with green - a marker for gaseous iron.\nThere is so much to peruse and probe in the full-sized survey image which is 21,000 by 14,500 pixels. But it is the JuMBOs that have caught the immediate attention of astronomers.\n\"My reactions ranged from: 'Whaaat?!?' to 'Are you sure?\" to 'That's just so weird!' to 'How could binaries be ejected together?'\" recalled Dr Heidi Hammel who was not on the survey team.  \nShe said there were no models of planetary system formation that predicted the ejection of binary pairs of planets.\n\"But... maybe all star formation regions host these double-Jupiters (and maybe even double-Neptunes and double Earths!), and we just haven't had a telescope powerful enough to see them before,\" the multidisciplinary scientist on JWST told BBC News.\nEsa will be posting the full image of M42 on its EsaSky portal which allows anyone to explore publicly available astronomical data. Initial papers describing the survey and the JuMBO discovery will be posted on the arXiv pre-print server on Tuesday.\nJWST is a joint venture between the US, European and Canadian space agencies.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cricket World Cup 2023: What the stats say about all 10 teams at tournament", "date": "2023-10-03 08:59:13", "text": "\nLast updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section Cricket\nThe World Cup in India is a matter of days away.\nEngland are one of 10 teams competing and will hope to defend their title after the famous victory on home soil in 2019.\nCan Jos Buttler's side do it again? Will hosts India make most of home advantage? Will we see a surprise winner?\nTo help answer those questions BBC Sport has worked with data analysts CricViz to produce a team-by-team guide to the 10 participating nations.\nCricViz win probability: 1.3%\nThe statistics paint a mixed picture for Afghanistan between bat and ball. \nThey have a bowling economy rate of 6.62 in the last 10 overs since the last World Cup, the best of any full member nation. However, they have only scored at 6.74 in the last 10 overs in the same timeframe - the lowest of any full member nation.\nCrucial player: Rashid Khan \nNo bowler has more wickets in the Indian Premier League than Rashid Khan's 139 since the leg-spinner made his debut in the competition in 2017.\nCricViz win probability: 15.6%\nFive-time winners Australia have great batting depth - Cameron Green could bat as low as eight in a squad packed full of all-rounders. But they are short in the spin department, with Ashton Agar's injury meaning Adam Zampa is the sole spinner in the squad.\nCrucial player: Glenn Maxwell \nThe powerful all-rounder averages 37 and has a strike-rate of 180 in overs 41-50 since the last World Cup - and his off-spin will be needed too.\nCricViz win probability: 2.9%\nSince the last World Cup, Bangladesh have a strong home record (16 wins, nine defeats) but have been less convincing away from home (nine wins, 12 defeats). They will also be unfamiliar with conditions - Bangladesh have only ever played nine one-day internationals in India, and none since 2006.\nCrucial player: Shakib Al-Hasan\nThe Bangladesh captain was one of only three players to score more than 600 runs in the 2019 World Cup, alongside Rohit Sharma and David Warner.\nCricViz win probability: 17.3%\nEngland have a catch success rate of 84% in one-day internationals since the last World Cup, the highest of all 10 teams competing in this tournament. \nBut with the bat, the end of the Jason Roy-Jonny Bairstow opening partnership has seen a drop-off in their powerplay scoring rate. In 2023, they have scored at 5.30 runs per over in the first 10 overs, their lowest since 2014.\nCrucial player: Ben Stokes \nThe talismanic all-rounder has finished not out in 13 of the 34 one-day international run chases he has featured in since 2015.\nCricViz win probability: 21.9%\nSince the last World Cup, India have played 66 matches, 10 more than any other team in this tournament (Sri Lanka have played the second-most games with 56). Their batting has also been particularly strong in the middle overs, going at 5.76 runs per over since the last World Cup which is second only to England (6.01).\nCrucial player: Virat Kohli \nCurrently on 47 one-day international hundreds, Kohli needs three more to overtake Sachin Tendulkar as the batter with the most hundreds in this format.\nCricViz win probability: 0.0%\nIn the World Cup Qualifiers, Netherlands' bowlers averaged under 30 with an economy rate of just 4.12 in the first 10 overs, and that was without Paul van Meekeren who will improve that area of their game even further. They are less potent in the middle overs, averaging 59 between overs 11 and 40 in the past two years.\nCrucial player: Bas de Leede\nThe 23-year-old all-rounder averaged 48 with a strike rate of 101 in this year's World Cup Qualifiers. He also took 15 wickets at an average of 22 in the competition.\nCricViz win probability: 8.5%\nSince the start of 2010, New Zealand have only won 29% of the one-day internationals they have played in India, with six victories in the 21 matches they have played in that time. \nThey have also struggled with their bowling at the death recently, conceding runs at 7.91 per over in that phase since the last World Cup, the second highest among full members.\nCrucial player: Trent Boult \nThe left-arm seamer took 39 wickets in the past two World Cups, second only to Australia's Mitchell Starc (49).\nCricViz win probability: 11.6%\nIn the middle overs since the last World Cup, Pakistan average 45.98 runs per wicket, largely thanks to Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. \nThey also have two of the fastest bowlers in the tournament in Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf. Shaheen's potency with the new ball and Rauf's death-over skills make them a complementary threat.\nCrucial player: Shaheen Shah Afridi\nAnother pacey left-armer, Shaheen averages just 24 with the ball in the first 10 overs of one-day internationals and took 4-35 against India in Pallekele last month.\nCricViz win probability: 14.1%\nHeinrich Klaasen is arguably the in-form batter in the world in this format, but South Africa have a concerningly long tail, with Keshav Maharaj likely to bat as high as eight, with Marco Jansen at seven.\nCrucial player: Heinrich Klaasen \nThe big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter averages 59 with a strike-rate of 151 in one-day internationals in 2023, including a brilliant 174 from just 83 deliveries against Australia in September - the highest ODI score for a batter coming in in the 25th over or later.\nCricViz win probability: 6.8%\nEven without the injured Wanindu Hasaranga, Sri Lanka have a dangerous spin attack, with Maheesh Theekshana (eight wickets at 29, economy of 5.15 in the Asia Cup) and Dunith Wellalage (10 wickets at 18, economy of 4.26 in the Asia Cup). \nBut they have struggled with the bat at the death recently, scoring at just 7.21 runs per over in the last 10 overs since the 2019 World Cup, higher only than Afghanistan in that time.\nCrucial player: Charith Asalanka \nThe left-hander, who made his ODI debut in 2021, averages 60 against spin bowling. He scored a century against Australia in Pallekele in 2022.\nPeter Fincham and Jon Plowman hear the inside story of one of the biggest TV comedies\nYou’ve heard the name Napoleon Bonaparte, but who was he really?\nPreview the fifth and final series of the grown-up comedy from the Horrible Histories team\n26 years after being washed off a cargo ship, the tiny toys are still coming ashore...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCan Burnley, Luton Town and Sheffield United transform their seasons with all three of the promoted teams struggling in the Premier League?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}

{"title": "Garth Crooks' Team of the Week: Johnstone, Dawson, Lockyer, Andersen, Bissouma and more", "date": "2023-10-02 22:09:42", "text": "\nLast updated on 2 October 20232 October 2023.From the section Premier League\nAt the end of every round of fixtures, BBC football pundit Garth Crooks is on hand to give you his Team of the Week.\nHere are this week's choices and, as ever, Garth has also given his view on the game's big talking points in the Crooks of the Matter.\nSam Johnstone (Crystal Palace): It might be Manchester United's worst start to a league campaign for 34 years but Johnstone won't lose a wink of sleep over that. In fact the Palace keeper is somewhat responsible for that rather damning statistic. \nJohnstone kept United at bay as the home side tried to crank up the pressure. Two memorable saves, the first from Bruno Fernandes and the second a blistering header from Rasmus Hojlund, supported by some quite brilliant defending by the likes of Marc Guehi and Tyrick Mitchell, produced a memorable result for the Eagles.\nI must say at this point Palace manager Roy Hodgson is defying all logic. He seems to have once again quietly rejuvenated the London club. \nCraig Dawson (Wolves): Seeing Pep Guardiola having to watch his team from the stands due to his touchline ban should have told us something. This was a bad afternoon for Manchester City and matters got progressively worse as the day wore on. \nThe ball from Ruben Dias was matched by the cross-field volley from Matheus Nunes but the clearance by Wolves defender Dawson, as Erling Haaland was about to tap the ball home, was magnificent. \nDawson went on to clear another certain goal off the line just as the champions looked as though they were back in control of the match. Wolves defended brilliantly on the day and Dawson in particular. They reduced arguably the best striker in the world to one genuine strike on goal.  \nTom Lockyer (Luton Town): I'm not entirely sure if this win by Luton is a commentary on how good the visitors were to pick up their first ever win in the Premier League or how poor Everton were in front of goal. What is it with Everton and home matches? They've lost seven out of their past eight. \nWales centre-back Lockyer showed the sort of grit and determination his team will need to stay in this league when he pounced on a rebound off the Everton crossbar. Ashley Young required two touches to clear the danger but the Luton captain had no intention of letting him have more than one, and promptly stuck the ball in the back of the net. \nLockyer should have scored earlier when he rose above the Everton defence and couldn't control the header from going over the bar, but later made amends. In the scheme of things this was a very important win by the Hatters away from home.  \nJoachim Andersen (Crystal Palace): I was a little surprised by the heavy nature of Palace's 3-0 defeat in midweek against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup. However having seen Hodgson's selection for that fixture I could see why they lost. \nTheir team on Tuesday night didn't look remotely like the one that beat United 1-0 in the Premier League four days later. Their performance on Saturday was also unrecognisable from the one they produced in midweek. \nAs for the goal by Andersen, I could hardly believe what I saw, and it's the second time I have seen the Denmark international score this season while keeping a clean sheet at the same time. \nThis was a very impressive away performance by Palace and they don't seem to be missing Wilfried Zaha. In fact I'm starting to think Palace look better without him. They certainly look less complicated. \nConor Gallagher (Chelsea): This is more like it. Chelsea looked, and for the very first time this season, like a team that had some serious money spent on it. Manager Mauricio Pochettino hadn't taken a scalpel to shape his squad against Fulham on Monday night - more like a machete with 12 first-team players out injured.\nFive of his subs had never kicked a ball in the first team before while Mykhailo Mudryk and Armando Broja looked a useful partnership up-front. Thiago Silva and Levi Colwill looked comfortable at the back while Moses Caicedo is clearly going to have an impact on the team. \nHowever nothing prepared me for the way Gallagher performed at Craven Cottage. The newly installed Chelsea captain didn't just cover every blade of grass but also played with a maturity that justified the role. Fulham's manager Marco Silva looked dazed by the end of this encounter and had every right to be as Chelsea had just blitzed his team. \nDouglas Luiz (Aston Villa): The ease with which he struck the ball to score his fifth consecutive home league goal in the 6-1 win over Brighton said it all for me. This player has been a revelation for Aston Villa since the arrival of Unai Emery.\nI always thought it would have been Philippe Coutinho who would be setting the scene alight at Villa Park, but it's another Brazilian who seems to be doing that right now. \nLuiz is playing out of his skin at the moment, meanwhile the team don't look out of place in the top six. Something mildly exciting is going on at the Villa and with another couple of additions in January who knows what they could achieve.     \nMartin Odegaard (Arsenal): This was more of a stroll down memory lane than a walk in the park for Arsenal away at Bournemouth. \nTwo penalties given away needlessly by Bournemouth due to defenders making challenges recklessly in their own box. Why they felt the need to go to ground when the player on the ball still had so much to do remains a mystery to me. \nOdegaard put one of the penalties away before being brought down for another and then providing the perfect cross for Ben White to add Arsenal's fourth goal.\nThis means no win for Bournemouth in their opening seven league games with Everton, Wolves and Burnley to come. It doesn't look good for the Cherries at the moment. I wonder if Bournemouth are starting to regret parting ways with Gary O'Neil?  \nYves Bissouma (Tottenham): For the second consecutive week Bissouma makes my team selection. The Malian was at the heart of Tottenham's performance against a hard-done-by Liverpool. \nThe decision by referee Simon Hooper to send off Curtis Jones was a poor one. At first glance you can be forgiven for thinking that the tackle was a bad one because you see Jones make contact with Bissouma. \nHowever, the Liverpool's player's foot moves with the momentum of the ball, and that momentum then carries Jones's foot into Bissouma. Hooper should have seen this on the replay and didn't, which is most concerning - a yellow card was plenty. \nNo sooner do Liverpool feel the effect of one injustice when another one comes along, but the video assistant referee (VAR) remained conspicuously silent. Luis Diaz's superb strike was ruled offside when you could see from the naked eye it was a perfectly good goal.     \nCarlton Morris (Luton Town): Whatever concerns I may have about Luton Town's ability to survive in the Premier League, credit where credit is due, there can be no doubt about the quality of the finish by Morris against Everton. \nLuton needed that second goal at Everton in order to take victory, and long may it continue if they have any chance of securing points in future fixtures. The question is where are all their goals going to come from? Morris can't score all of them. \nBournemouth are a similar-sized club and were in a comparable position some years ago. They had Callum Wilson who has gone on and built an international career for himself having adjusted to the Premier League, and they created an outstanding manager in Eddie Howe who is now managing in the Champions League, so we have seen what can be achieved.   \nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): What on earth happened to Brighton? Three goals conceded in 15 minutes. As for Aston Villa's Watkins - everything he touched seemed to turn gold. I've seen better hat-tricks but players who score three goals in a match invariably make my team selection. \nWhen it's going for you, it's going for you. Watkins' first goal was a side foot after a decent cross from Matty Cash; the second he scuffed and I can't for the life of me understand why keeper Jason Steele didn't do better to get a hand to the ball. The third was a deflected shot. \nI don't know if Watkins plays the lottery but I suggest he buys a ticket this week, because the way his luck is going anything is possible.  \nMiguel Almiron (Newcastle): I can't watch Almiron score a goal like the one he got against Burnley and not put him in my team. We've seen him do this before, but just when I was beginning to think the Paraguay international was starting to run out of the spectacular he comes up with the most glorious finish.\nMeanwhile, I can't help but agree with Vincent Kompany in that Burnley have had a very unfortunate fixture schedule. They have already played three teams out of the top six and Newcastle who are in the Champions League. \nEven though the Clarets have looked competent throughout, their next few games, including Luton away, will be telling\nWe were told that any offside decision made by VAR was irrefutable and that we could trust the science. \nIt would appear, having seen Diaz's superb strike ruled offside and Liverpool denied a share of the spoils against Tottenham, we can't in fact trust the operators in charge of the science due to what can only be described as human frailties. \nThe best of us have suffered from sweaty palms, dryness of the mouth or a lapse in concentration during intense moments, but assistance is often at hand to get you through the moment. \nHowever when the entire system comes crashing down then we have a problem, and with it a far greater question is posed: to what extent has this apparent system failure affected other fixtures in the past?\nIt's not that long ago retired referee Mike Dean declared that he failed to correct a mistake in a match to save his friend and fellow official Anthony Taylor from extra \"grief\". When I first read this comment I thought it must be a joke... 'save his friend from extra grief'? \nMatch officials have always made mistakes but they have been honest mistakes. The integrity of the game has always been held in the hands of our match officials and so it should remain. \nHowever when mistakes are made they need to be rectified immediately without fear or favour, and our officials should not be afraid that the science or the technology might expose their human frailties. \nThe game has always had the capacity to forgive the honest mistake and that should never change.

The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.\nRosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. \"We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,\" she says. \n\"There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard.\" \nShe keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around £40.\nLynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced section. \"If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,\" she says.\nShe suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.\n\"Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,\" she says. \"If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings.\"\nAccording to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around £700 every year by throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on waste.\n\"If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,\" she says. \"Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them.\"\nMore on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website.\nKate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.\n\"You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,\" she explains. \"But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money.\"\nRosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. \"How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,\" she explains. \nShe puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.\nHelen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. \n\"Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,\" she says. \nKeeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5°C. \"We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,\" she says. \"This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature.\"\nRosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience. \n\"Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,\" she says. \"If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got £8 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cuts.\n\"They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further.\"\nWe asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: \nMy wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland\nI highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of \"what's for dinner\"? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey\nTip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder.

{"title": "Cost of living: Five tips when asking for a pay rise", "date": "2023-08-15 10:33:09", "text": "If you feel like you're not getting paid enough, you're probably not alone.\nWhile average wages have been increasing, they're still not keeping up with the pace of price rises, which means many people are finding it harder to get by.\nRecent months have seen waves of strikes, with tens of thousands of workers walking out in disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.\nMany of these strikes have taken place in the public sector, where workers often do not have the power to negotiate individually.\nAnd whether you work in the public or private sector, even if you do have a conversation with your manager there's no guarantee that it will result in a pay rise.\nHowever, there are ways to give yourself the best chance of success. \nWe spoke to recruiters, a manager and a workplace psychologist to get five tips on how to best negotiate for more money.\nJill Cotton, a career trends experts at jobs site Glassdoor, says scheduling a talk in advance will allow you and your boss time to prepare, and means you're more likely to have a productive conversation.\n\"Don't spring this on your line manager,\" Ms Cotton says. \"Be upfront and say that you want to book in a conversation that is specifically about pay.\"\nRowsonara Begum, who helps her brother run Saffron Indian takeaway in Salisbury, says it also needs to be the right time for the business.\nThe takeaway has five members of staff and occasionally takes on additional workers during busy periods.\nShe says if workers pick a time when the business is doing well, they will have the best chance of successfully negotiating more money.\nIf you're asking for a pay rise, you should have lots of evidence of why you deserve one.\n\"Know what you've achieved either from a work setting or what you've done to develop yourself, maybe to support your team, support your line managers. List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.\nThis evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.\n\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.\nHowever, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.\n\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"\nWhen asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.\nThat's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.\n\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.\n\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"\nOften people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".\nWomen and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.\nHer advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.\nMost experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.\nDo your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.\n\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.\nMs Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.\n\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.\nIf the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.\n\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.\nPay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.\n\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.\nAnd if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.\n\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.\nPay rises at fastest pace for over 20 years\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nStrike dates: Who is striking and what pay do they want?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?", "date": "2023-08-01 12:47:44", "text": "House prices have been falling in recent months.\nThat's because higher interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, while rising prices have hit people's spending power.\nPrices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022. \nBut they have fallen by nearly 5% from their peak, according to July's figures from the Nationwide Building Society. \nThe largest falls are in the South West and the smallest in Northern Ireland, Nationwide's figures show. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThese recent changes build on very different patterns of house price growth over the last 15 years. \nNorthern Ireland's prices have not returned to levels seen before the 2008 global financial crisis.\nIn contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015. They then saw less growth during the pandemic, when many people relocated to cheaper areas in search of more space. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nHigher interest rates mean new mortgages are more expensive.\nAsking prices have not fallen far enough to balance this out. So, first-time buyers are unlikely to find buying a house more affordable in the short term. \nIn the longer run, if wages increase faster than house prices recover, housing will become more affordable. \nThose longer term trends also depend on whether housebuilding keeps up with demand. \nAffordability is worst in the South of England where a first-time buyer could expect to spend more than half of their income on their mortgage payments. But in areas like the Midlands, it's more like a third.\nIn March, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which advises the government on the health of the economy, predicted that house prices will drop by 10% over the next two years.\nThat would be about half the fall of the financial crisis of 2008 and would put prices back to autumn 2021 levels.\nBut predictions are very uncertain. \nSome observers hope for a \"soft landing\". That could mean interest rates nearing their peak now, small price falls in the rest of 2023 and then little, if any, growth next year.\nAn alternative view is that further sharp rises in interest rates could trigger even steeper falls in house prices in Autumn. \nAbout 100,000 households come off a fixed-price mortgage each month. Even if rates stabilise, they will still be hit with interest rates that are higher than their last mortgage.\nSome may find their new monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell, possibly pushing prices down. \nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice.

The loans can become difficult to repay when mortgage rates rise, or inflation bites. \nHowever, lending rules were tightened after the 2008 crash. Most borrowers in recent years have had their ability to pay checked against higher interest rates than those we're currently seeing. \nFortunately, the number of people behind on their mortgages did not rise significantly in 2022 and was still at half the 2008 level.  \nThe number of repossessions in 2022 was also less than a tenth of what was seen in the years after the crash.  \nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments? The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nThe amount people can spend of their mortgage also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures: on energy bills, wages and job security.\nAnd these factors can all change significantly. \nThe future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole, and that picture is also uncertain. \nData visualisation by Rob England and Jana Tauschinski.

The sector has seen considerable upheaval in the past year, after many years of ultra-low rates.\nThe typical interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers shot up after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but subsequently rose to a 15-year high. \nThere have been some signs of reductions recently, but rates are still comparatively high.\nThat's because wages and prices are rising faster and for longer than expected, and meaning the Bank of England may raise the base rate higher.\nThe Bank has warned that more than two million households will pay between £200 and £499 more a month on new deals from the end of this year and the end of 2026. \nA further one million mortgage holders will see their monthly payments rise by at least £500 over the next two and a half years.\nIf the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will also face higher repayments.\nHouse prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.\nThe government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.\nThere are still likely to be plenty of options, depending on your circumstances. The bigger question is whether people can afford higher repayments.\nAn agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage without a new affordability test when their current deal ends, as long as their payments are up-to-date.\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nIf you have savings, you could consider paying down some of the total amount borrowed. \nSavings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, where you only pay interest on the mortgage balance, minus the amount you've saved.\nYou may want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total. \nA broker can guide you through the different options.\nOwing two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.\nBut the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage firms, says lenders must treat customers fairly.\nIt says borrowers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they will struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must offer help.\nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments? The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nWithin 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:\nYour lender must consider any reasonable request to resolve the arrears. This could include reducing your monthly payment by extending the term of the mortgage, or switching to an interest-only payment for a certain period. \nMissing monthly payments - or arranging to pay less than you owe - will be reflected on your credit file, which could affect your ability to borrow money in the future. \nA mortgage payment holiday lets borrowers delay repayments for a short time.\nLenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances, although probably not to those already in arrears. \nThe level of support offered to customers during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.\nAgain, a payment holiday will show on your credit file. \nSome people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.\nRepossessions are far rarer than they used to be. \nThere are several stages before a lender can do this, and the whole process takes about two years.\nBut if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice about your options. \nGovernments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments, but many lenders have signed up to the government's mortgage charter which ensures they are clear about the options available.\nFor people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but in the form of a loan (which must be repaid, with interest). \nBorrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.\nThere are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also run some mortgage support schemes, but the rules are complicated, and they tend to focus on people at risk of homelessness. \nThere is more information on the government-backed Moneyhelper website.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "First time home buyers: How much can I borrow?", "date": "2023-05-12 09:47:46", "text": "With rents rising, lots of people are crunching the numbers to see if they can afford to buy their own home.\nBut it is a big financial commitment, with risks if house prices fall or if you need to relocate. \nSo what do you need to know to help you decide?\nMost people spend less each month on their mortgage payments than they would on rent for a similar property, according to the Halifax. \nHalifax's most recent Owning vs Renting review found on average the monthly mortgage costs for a three-bed home were £42 lower than renting the equivalent.\nBut the difference varies widely across the UK.\nHomeowners in Scotland make big savings compared to renters. While in the east of England it is cheaper to rent than to own.\nFirst-time buyers can apply for the same mortgage deals as any other borrower. But banks and building societies will look very closely at a first-time buyer's financial situation and credit record. \nAfter a year of steadily rising interest rates, mortgage rates have also gone up, to between 4% and 7%.\nMortgage brokers like Riz Malik at R3Mortgages say that it can be hard for first-time buyers to borrow large amounts, as lenders are getting tougher over affordability criteria. \nTypically, a bank might lend you four or five times your salary.\nIt also depends on what outgoings you have. If you already owe money, such as a car loan, or have student debt, that will be taken into account.\nA lot of money advice websites have calculators to help you work out what you can afford and mortgage brokers can help you identify deals to suit your situation.\nThe average house price for a first-time buyer is just over £300,000.\nSaving a large enough deposit is the biggest hurdle for many would-be homeowners, one of the reasons the average age of a first-time buyer has risen to 32.\nUsually you need a deposit worth at least 10% of the property's value. But the bigger your deposit, the better deal you will get from the lender.\nThe average deposit for first-time buyers is £62,470 according to Halifax, almost double the UK's average annual salary, with people typically putting down around 20% of the purchase price of their property.\nSome lenders will accept a deposit of 5% of the property's value. Skipton Building Society is even offering a no-deposit mortgage. It is the first mortgage to cover 100% of the value of the property since the financial crisis and uses your history as a rent-payer to establish credit-worthiness.\nIf you are saving for a deposit and you are between 18 and 40, the government will match 25% of any money you save in a Lifetime ISA.\nMore than 60% of first-time buyers are opting for joint-ownership and that's not just couples. Increasingly friends are choosing to buy together too, says Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons Estate Agency.\nAny joint arrangement should be drawn up with a proper legal contract, as all parties will be liable for the full mortgage, says Ms Beveridge.\nA first-time buyer is someone who has never owned or part-owned a property before. That offers a tax advantage as long as you are buying a property to live in.\nIn England and Northern Ireland first-time buyers don't pay stamp duty - a tax based on the value of the property you're buying - on properties worth less than £425,000.\nScotland's equivalent, the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, is waived for first-time buyers of properties worth less than £175,000.\nThere is no first-time buyer relief for the Wales' Land Transaction Tax.\nThe biggest government scheme to support home-buyers, Help to Buy, has ended (except in Wales), although recently there have been reports the government is considering a reboot.\nThere are others including the First Homes scheme, aimed at helping first-time buyers and keyworkers with a household income under £80,000 (or £90,000 in London) to buy new-build properties.\nShared ownership schemes allow you to buy a share of the property and pay rent for the rest, with the option of increasing your stake when you can afford to.\nNeither of these schemes are on the scale of Help to Buy, says David Hollingworth at L&C Mortgages. Help to Buy helped ramp up house prices, he adds, making them less affordable for first-time buyers today.\nDeposit-free mortgage aimed at renters launched\nWhat are the new stamp duty rates?\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is happening to house prices?\nWhat are your rights when you're renting?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

But there are about 8.65 million people out of work. \nIt may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.\nThere have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. \nYvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says \"Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. \n\"Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,\" she says.\n\"Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role.\"\nMs Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.\n\"For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. \n\"So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. \n\"Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same.\"\nNot all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. \nMany businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. \nMiranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: \"Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.\n\"They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help.\"\nLots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. \nBut now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. \nOther platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. \nYvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.\n\"Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application.\" \nIt can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. \nMiranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: \"Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for.\"\nIt's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. \nOur career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. \nCareer influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. \nShe's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. \n\"Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact.

{"title": "Energy price cap: What is it and will bills continue to go down?", "date": "2023-09-29 11:21:27", "text": "Millions will see their energy bills fall from 1 October, after a drop in the price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for each unit of gas and electricity they use.\nA typical dual-fuel household will pay £1,923 a year between October and December - down from £2,074 in the previous period.\nIn recent years, the cost of variable tariff energy deals in England, Wales and Scotland has been controlled by the energy price cap, which is now set every three months by Ofgem, the energy regulator. \nThe cap confirms the maximum price suppliers can charge households per unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff in normal circumstances. It covers 29 million households. \nEnergy prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so in October ministers said household bills would be limited by a temporary government guarantee instead. \nUnder this, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill stayed below £2,500 despite Ofgem's cap increasing above this level. \nThe Energy Price Guarantee finished in June 2023, and the Ofgem cap once again determines how much customers can be charged. \nFrom 1 October, typical bills will be £1,923, which is £151 less than the previous cap and £577 down on last winter.\nEnergy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland, where bills are slightly lower.\nThe calculations for a typical household are based on a direct debit customer using 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year. \nA kilowatt hour is a unit of energy used to calculate your bill. \nHowever, most households aren't typical. \nBills are based on how much energy you actually use, which depends on the number of people, the type of property and its energy efficiency.\nIn July 2023, Ofgem said \"around 4 million\" households had prepayment meters.\nIt reviewed their use after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.\nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain households. \nThe government has promised to bring prepayment energy charges in line with those for direct debit customers, but this has not yet happened. \nBetween October and December, the typical bill for prepayment households will be £1,949, down from £2,077, but still £26 more than for direct debit customers.\nTypical bills for those who pay via cash, cheque or bank transfer, usually every three months, will be £129 more. \nIt is is impossible to tell for certain, not least because wholesale energy prices are affected by global issues, such as the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts that prices will rise again in January 2024. \nIt estimates that typical annual bills will rise to £1,996. \nThe consultancy does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade.\nLower prices should restart competition in the market, as suppliers start to offer fixed deals to customers, which set gas and electricity prices for a certain period of time. \nUnlike variable tariffs, these are unaffected by the cap.\nConsumer groups and regulators say this could be good for consumers, but warn that such deals do not suit all circumstances.\nIf variable deals continue to fall in price, anyone already locked into a fixed deal would miss out on those savings. \nThose considering signing up for a fixed deal should also pay close attention to standing charges and exit fees, rather than just the headline rate.\nSome groups across the UK who may struggle to pay bills are receiving additional help through cost-of-living payments:\nVulnerable families can also claim help through the Household Support Fund, and - from October 2023 - the Warm Home Discount scheme. \nImportantly, the £400 discount which all households in England, Wales and Scotland received last winter has finished. \nUntil the end of March 2023, businesses had their costs limited under the government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme. \nUnder a new scheme running until March 2024, firms get a discount on wholesale prices, rather than costs being capped. \nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, will get a larger discount than others.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

It replaced the previous Ofgem energy price cap, and limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500. \nThis remained in place until the end of June 2023, when the Ofgem cap was reinstated, at which point a typical annual energy bill fell to £2,074.\nUnder the latest price cap, typical annual bills will fall to around £1,923 between October and December.\nIf you don't agree a payment plan with your supplier, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed, or they may switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nIn very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection, but you'll normally be offered a meter first.\nIf you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:\nSuppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.\nMany suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.\nPaying by direct debit is normally the cheapest way to pay for electricity and gas. Cancelling a direct debit means future bills are likely to be higher.\nNon-payment could also damage your credit rating, and make it harder to borrow money. \nThe regulator Ofgem reviewed the use of prepayment meters after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. \nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\". \nIn addition meters cannot be fitted for:\nThose forced onto a prepayment meter will get £30 initial credit to reduce the risk of them losing supply.\nThe government has said prepayment energy charges will be cut, bringing them in line with direct debit rates.\nSuppliers have also been told to identify households where meters were wrongfully installed, return the customer to their previous tariff and offer compensation. \nCheck your direct debit\nYour monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year, and your supplier may reduce your bill if its estimate is higher than the amount you actually use.\nYou can also request a flexible monthly direct debit where you only pay for your actual consumption. This requires a smart meter or regular readings.\nHowever, two-thirds of gas usage is during the winter months, so make sure you understand the impact of reducing payments during warmer weather. \nPay what you can\nIf the direct debit is fair, but you can't meet it, ask your supplier for an \"able to pay plan\" based on what you can afford. \nBy paying something every month - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears grow more slowly, and your supplier may be less worried about your debt. \nYou may be able to get your name added to the Priority Services Register (PSR), a list of households entitled to extra support. \nThose eligible include pensioners, pregnant women, parents of young children, and people who are disabled. \nOfgem also recommends asking your supplier to add your name to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on your energy supply for medical reasons.\nIf you have different gas and electricity suppliers, you need to contact them both.\nBeing on the PSR doesn't cancel your arrears. But it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. \nClaim any relevant benefits\nThe independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide to available benefits, while Policy in Practice and the charities Entitledto and Turn2us run benefits calculators.\nYou may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through the government's Fuel Direct scheme.\nA number of suppliers and charities also offer hardship grants. \nCheck you're getting extra government help\nThere is a range of government support to help with energy bills, available to households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on certain disability benefits.\nThe next payments for some eligible groups will be made between 31 October and 19 November.\nAdjust your boiler\nIf you have a combi boiler at home - you don't have a hot water cylinder and there is a (usually white) plastic pipe under the boiler - you may wish to consider turning down the heating flow temperature. \nOn the front - sometimes behind a flap - look for a dial or set of buttons with a radiator icon. Turn the dial to the number three, or the 12 o'clock position. If it has a digital display, select 60C. \nYou may also want to turn off the hot water pre-heat. Many boilers come on every few hours - night and day - to ensure there's always some hot water available. \nMost homes don't need this, and turning it off saves money. \nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Energy saving tips: Five ways to cut costs this winter", "date": "2023-08-24 12:06:46", "text": "The new energy price cap has set the amount suppliers can charge customers this coming winter.\nTypical bills have fallen back from last year's levels but there are other ways you may be able to reduce your costs. \nActual savings will vary for different households. \nMost of the energy we use at home goes on heating.\nTurning the thermostat down by just one degree could save about £150 annually. \nYou can also use your boiler's timer - if it has one - to ensure your heating switches off when the house is empty. \nWhile it might be tempting to reduce your heating to save money, the government recommends a room temperature of at least 18C. Older people and those who are ill or disabled may need it to be warmer. \nIf your house is too cold it could encourage damp - which can lead to mould. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma.\nHow this saving is worked out: Experts at Cambridge Architectural Research (CAR) found that turning the thermostat down from 19C to 18C would save 13% on an average annual gas bill - that was worth about £157 in winter 2022. CAR suggests 68% of homes could benefit. Its findings are based on estimated energy use in 12,300 homes questioned by the English Housing Survey in 2012. The Energy Saving Trust previously estimated a saving of £145 a year, if temperatures were reduced from 22C to 21C in main living areas.\nIf you have a combi boiler, try reducing the flow temperature for the water heating your home to 60C. This is the temperature of the water the boiler sends to the radiators.  \nA higher temperature will heat your home faster, but it could also mean bigger bills.\nCombi boilers tend to capture and recycle heat less efficiently at higher temperatures - meaning it requires more gas to heat your home.\nIf you have a conventional boiler, such as a system with a hot water tank, you could try setting it to 65C. It's important not to set it any lower as it could create a health risk - legionella bacteria could develop in the water.\nIf you want to consider adjusting the flow temperature, the Energy Saving Trust has more information and the Nesta charity has a guide to walk you through the process.\nIf you rent your home you might want to check with your landlord before making changes. \nHow this saving is  worked out: CAR modelled the potential savings from reducing the temperature of combi boilers from 75C to 60C, in 2022. It found this would save 8% on an average annual gas bill - about £97 in winter 2022. CAR suggests 38% of homes in the UK could save money with this measure. \nThere are a couple of ways to save money when you shower.\nFirstly, cutting the length of your shower from about seven minutes to four could save about £84 a year. \nSecondly, you could consider buying a water-efficient showerhead - available from about £10. (Check they are compatible with your shower first).\nThese work by restricting the amount of water coming through the head. This means you use less hot water for the same length of shower. This could mean a saving of about £98 a year even if you don't have shorter showers.\nHow this saving is worked out: CAR assumed that each household took two showers a day, that an average shower lasted seven minutes, used eight litres a minute and had a temperature of 41C. It says four-minute showers would save an average of 24 litres of hot water, resulting in an energy saving of 1.1 kWh per shower, or around 800 kWh per year for a household. CAR also estimated that a low-flow shower head would save an average of 28 litres of hot water, resulting an energy saving of 1.3 kWh per shower, or around 950 kWh per year for a household. \nRadiators in many homes have valves which control the temperature in each room. \nIf used correctly, these thermostatic radiator valves - often numbered one to five (sometimes up to six) - can save you money.\nIn rooms you use less often, consider turning the valve to the midway point (this should still heat the room to 18-20C). \nKeeping doors closed will also help trap heat.\nHow is the saving worked out: CAR's study found that homes with radiator valves are likely to have partially adjusted them so that rooms outside the main living area are already 1.5°C cooler. However, reducing the temperature by a further 1.5°C could save 5.5% of the total gas bill (a saving of £68 in winter 2022). Its modelling found that 76% of UK homes could save with this measure.\nPoorly insulated homes lose heat more easily and are harder to keep warm.\nDraught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy.\nTo stop cold air getting in and heat escaping, consider:\nBut do not block extractor fans, wall vents and airbricks. These are necessary for ventilating certain rooms (like your kitchen and bathroom).\nThe cost depends on which areas you want to draught-proof and how you want to do it. A professional draught-proofing service could save more energy. The Energy Saving Trust has further advice. \nHow this saving is worked out: The saving is based on a typical three-bed gas heated, semi-detached house using a gas price of 10.3p/kWh and electricity price of 34.0p/kWh. The Energy Saving Trust's figures are based on the government's methodology for energy modelling in homes. \nNote: All savings figures are based on a typical gas-heated home in Great Britain with an annual usage of around 12,000 kWh of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity, using a gas price of 10.3p/kWh and electricity price of 34.0p/kWh (based on Energy Price Guarantee October 2022).\nCombining all measures could potentially save a typical household £530 per year, according to Nesta/CAR/Energy Saving Trust calculations. Due to the potential for double counting, this is less than the £625 total of adding up each individual measure in this article. There are dangers in overly severe energy rationing - underheated and damp homes come with health risks.\nThese tips have been chosen in collaboration with UK broadcasters - including the BBC, ITV, Sky, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - as well as Citizens Advice, the Climate Change Committee, Energy Saving Trust and Nesta. \nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Interest rates: How the Bank of England's decision affects you and your money", "date": "2023-09-22 08:49:55", "text": "The Bank of England has held interest rates, ending a run of 14 consecutive increases.\nIn September, the Bank rate, set by the Monetary Policy Committee, was unchanged from the previous month at 5.25%.\nThat may bring some relief to homeowners who have seen mortgage rates rise and potentially the end of better news for savers.\nThe Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 15 years.  \nThe theory is that raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money, meaning people have less to spend, reducing demand and inflation.\nRates had risen 14 times in a row since December 2021 as the Bank tries to bring inflation closer to its target of 2%.\nPrices rose by 6.7% in the year to August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was lower than the 6.8% in the year to July, and down from the peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\nAlthough that is still more than three times the Bank's 2% target, it has influenced the decision to pause the run of Bank rate rises. That decision was split, with five of the nine-member committee voting for a pause. \nPolicymakers will be keeping a close eye on the \"core inflation\" rate - a measure which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy. It was down from 6.9% in July to 6.2% in August.\nThe chances of rates actually starting to fall again look slim at the moment.\nAndrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: \"I can tell you that we have not had any discussion... about reducing rates, because that would be very, very premature. Our job is to get inflation down.\"\nAt one point, UK rates were expected to rise above 6%, but that peak is now expected to be lower, even if there is a rise at a later date. \nThe Bank has to balance the risk of damaging the economy, which has shown little sign of growth, with the need to slow price rises.\nIts Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide rates.\nMortgages\nJust under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey.\nWhen interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. \nDespite the pause in rises, compared with December 2021, those on a tracker mortgage are still paying £540 more a month, and those on an SVR are paying £299 more a month.\nAround three-quarters of mortgage customers hold fixed-rate deals. Lenders may now have some confidence to lower mortgage rates, although they are still much higher than much of the last 10 years.\nComparatively high interest rates mean house buyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a year or more ago. \nAs people roll off cheap fixed-rate deals onto products with much higher rates, monthly repayments can soar by hundreds of pounds. Banking trade body UK Finance says there are about 800,000 fixed rate deals ending in the second half of 2023, and about 1.6 million deals expiring next year.\nThe IFS, a politically independent think tank, warns rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable income fall by more than 20%.\nYou can see how your mortgage may be affected by using our calculator:\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nCredit cards and loans\nBank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. \nThe latest Bank statistics show that in July, the average annual interest rate was 21.7% on bank overdrafts and 20.76% on credit cards. The average rate for personal loans was 8.61%, up slightly on the previous month. \nLenders could decide to put prices up, if they expect higher interest rates in the future.\nSavings\nIndividual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rate rises to customers. \nThere are some good deals on the market already, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as many will be on accounts paying little or nothing. \nThe UK's financial watchdog has warned that banks will face \"robust action\" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers.\nAlthough many savings accounts are paying more, even the best interest rates aren't keeping up with inflation. \nThis means the value of cash savings - its buying power - is falling in real terms. \nInflation has been relatively high worldwide, after Covid restrictions eased and consumers spent more. \nMany firms experienced problems getting enough goods to sell. Oil and gas costs were also higher than they had been - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \nAlthough many elements of inflation are global, there are also domestic factors at play in the UK, including rising wages.\nInterest rates have been increasing across the world in recent months.\nThe UK has one of the highest rates in the G7 - a group of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.\nIt is higher than the Euro area and the US.\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nIs this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?\nWhy does the Bank of England change interest rates?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Five ways to save money on your packed lunch", "date": "2023-09-18 16:36:41", "text": "Usually it's cheaper to make lunch at home instead of buying food out and about. But over the last year, staple lunchtime ingredients have gone up in price at the supermarket.\nWe've gathered some top tips on how to keep costs down when making a packed lunch for work, school or a day trip.\nCaroline Job launched blog and YouTube channel Lunchbox World when coming up with different ideas for her three kids' packed lunches. She enters an identical list of items into different supermarkets' online shopping apps to see which one comes up cheapest, and looks for discount codes.\nAlthough it might take a bit of extra time, Caroline says it has made a big difference as she has noticed the prices going up for different products like cucumbers or eggs.\nIf you buy your food from town centre convenience stores they might charge more - so you could save money by going to a large supermarket to stock up.\nYou could also consider swapping your favourite branded snacks for own-label versions.\nCaroline also suggests taking a look at what is in the cupboards, fridge or freezer before doing the food shop to make sure you're not doubling up.\n\"Have a plan as to what meals you're going to prep and what you might want to eat that week for your lunch,\" she says.\nShe adds that one \"game changer\" for her was working with best before dates to ensure that food was not being wasted.\n\"I now rejig my menu for the week as it progresses - if the ham is going off, then I'll use that up today and have a chicken sandwich tomorrow.\"\nRitesh, a father of two from Hounslow, adds that prepping different items has helped him manage a squeezed budget.\n\"Our kids love rice pancakes, so we will often prep the mixture the night before and we'll have them for breakfast and combine them with something different for lunch,\" he says.\nIt can be frustrating when a lunchbox comes back from school at the end of the day completely untouched.\nBut the freezer can be a big help when it comes to getting a greater variety of food on the menu for the week.\nThe NHS Better Health website recommends keeping a small selection of different types of bread in the freezer like bagels, pittas and wraps, granary or multigrain. If you pop a piece of greaseproof paper in between each, it's easier to get just one out when it's frozen, Caroline suggests.\nAnd if you're looking for a snack option, frozen fruit is typically cheaper than fresh, especially out of season.\nFrozen fruits count towards your five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. There is less waste and you can choose the exact amount you want to use.\nWith food prices rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, Dr Charlotte Evans - an associate professor at the University of Leeds, specialising in nutritional epidemiology and public health - is concerned the nutritional value of packed lunches might decline as budgets are squeezed.\nShe argues: \"Replacing homemade items with the cheapest, pre-packed snacks like crisps or chocolate biscuits might be the first place people look to make savings.\"\nAlthough it can be tempting to reach for something that saves on time, pre-prepared options can often be a lot more expensive at the shops and less nutritious.\nDr Evans suggests making up your own a Japanese-inspired, compartmentalised bento box to use up leftover items in the fridge or cupboard.\n\"It's a great way to use up lots of little bits - a wrap, some lettuce or carrots, a little bit of bean chilli from the night before.\"\nThe British Nutrition Foundation suggests putting a small handful of mixed dried fruits or nuts into reusable food bags or sealed containers to store in the cupboard to make your own easy snack.\nAnd if you have some spare time, growing your own cress for your egg sandwiches could also be a fun project for the family - as well as cheaper than buying it from the supermarket.\nBatch-cooking is a great way to save on money and time in the long-run, says personal finance expert Rachel Wait.\nShe says that pasta dishes are easy to make in bulk, along with stews with beans, soups or muffins. \nYou could just make a little extra for your evening meal and use the leftovers the day after for your lunchbox.\n\"Cooking with pulses like beans and lentils can be a cheaper alternative to meat and can also help bulk out meals,\" she points out.\nDr Evans adds that adding extra salad items like lettuce or cucumber to a sandwich could help bring costs down too.\n\"It can make a sandwich look much more appetising - different textures, colours... It makes it look like a proper sandwich and bulking up on the veg means you're using perhaps a little bit less of the expensive stuff like cheese and ham.\"\nFive hacks to help save money on your food shop\nPret hikes price of drinks subscription to £30\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is GDP and how is it measured?", "date": "2023-09-13 08:54:37", "text": "GDP - or Gross Domestic Product - is an important tool for judging how well, or badly, an economy is doing. \nIt helps businesses decide when to expand and hire more people, and lets the government work out how much it can afford to tax and spend.\nGDP is a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in a country.\nIn the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more significant.\nWhen an economy is growing, each quarterly GDP figure is slightly bigger in than the previous three-month period. \nMost economists, politicians and businesses like to see a steadily rising GDP because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.\nWhen GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which is bad news for businesses and workers. \nIf GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can lead pay freezes and lost jobs. \nThe Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.\nAlthough higher prices have squeezed consumers' budgets more recently, the UK has avoided going into recession.\nAccording to the official statistics for the most recent quarter, the economy grew by 0.2% between April and June. That was slightly higher than predicted. \nHowever, the monthly figure for July suggests the economy actually shrank by 0.5%, which is worse than expected. \nThe Office of National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was driven by strike action by NHS workers and teachers, plus wet weather which hit construction and retailers.\nIn January 2023, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out a pledge to \"grow the economy\". This will be met if GDP is bigger in the three-month period between October and December 2023 than it was during the previous quarter (July-September).\nThe government can use growing GDP as evidence that it is doing a good job of managing the economy. Likewise, if GDP falls, opposition politicians say the government is running it badly.\nBut it's more than just a report card on the government's economic performance. \nIf GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals.\nGovernments also like to keep an eye on how much they are borrowing in relation to the size of the economy. \nFor example borrowing was equivalent to about 14% of GDP in the first year of the Covid pandemic, the highest proportion since World War Two.\nGDP can be measured in three ways:\nIn the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. \nBut early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. \nThe UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.\nAt that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in.\nThe ONS publishes more information about this on its website.\nGDP doesn't tell the whole story:\nJust because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that an individual person's standard of living is improving. \nIf a country's population increases, it pushes GDP up, because with more people, more money will be spent. \nBut individuals within that country might not be getting richer. They may be getting poorer on average, even while GDP goes up.\nThe ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. \nSome critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable, or the environmental damage it might do. \nAlternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. \nIn 2010, the ONS started measuring well-being alongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. \nIn 2019, then New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern released the country's first \"well-being budget\", prioritising health and life-satisfaction rather than economic growth. \nBut despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is the UK inflation rate and why is it so high?", "date": "2023-09-21 11:59:09", "text": "The rate at which prices are rising slid to 6.7% in the year to August, down from 6.8% in July.\nSlowing food inflation on items like milk, cheese and eggs helped drive the surprise fall, although the pace of food price rises remains high - at 13.6%.\nTo help slow inflation, the Bank of England has increased interest rates 14 times to 5.25% since November 2021. \nInflation is the increase in the price of something over time. \nIf a bottle of milk costs £1 but £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) tracks the prices of hundreds of everyday items in an imaginary \"basket of goods\".\nThe basket is constantly updated to reflect shopping trends, with the most recent changes adding frozen berries and removing alcopops.\nEach month's inflation figure shows how much these prices have risen since the same date last year. \nYou can calculate inflation in various ways, but the main \"headline\" measure is the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).  \nThe CPI rate was 6.7% in the year to August, down from 6.8% in July.\n\"Core inflation\" excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco.\nThis measure was 6.2% in August, down from 6.9% in June and July, which was the highest level since 1992.\nThe Bank of England considers this number as well as CPI when deciding whether to change interest rates. \nSoaring food and energy bills helped drive inflation up. \nOil and gas were in greater demand after Covid. The war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.\nThe conflict also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. \nThis effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.\nAlcohol prices in restaurants and pubs had also risen. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThe Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is still well above that. \nThe traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. \nThis makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. \nWhen people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.\nBusinesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. \nIn August, the Bank increased interest rates for the 14th time in a row, taking the main rate to 5.25%. \nIt had been widely expected to raise rates again in September but instead decided to hold them at 5.25%. \nOfficial figures showed that - on average - regular pay excluding bonuses grew by 7.8% between May and July, compared to the same period a year earlier. \nThis nearly matched the rate of inflation in the same period, which meant real wage growth was almost flat for the first time in two years, after falling behind. \nHowever, unions point out that many workers have received smaller pay increases, and there have been widespread strikes over pay. \nThe government has argued that big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. \nLower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they rise less quickly.\nThe Bank of England has predicted inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.\nBank governor Andrew Bailey said it was \"crucial that we see the job through\" and get price rises back to the 2% target, because people \"should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value\".\nBut he admitted that price inflation has been \"more sticky than previously expected\".\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.\nIn January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. \nOther countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.\nMany of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials, and the fallout from Covid.\nThe annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 5.3% in the 12 months to July, stable compared to June and down from 6.1% in May.\nThe European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. On 14 September, it raised its key interest rate - the benchmark deposit rate - to 4%, a record high.\nIn the US, inflation was 3.7% in the year to August, up from 3.2% in July and 3% in June. \nAt its September meeting, the US central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged between 5.25%-5.5% as it considers whether it has done enough to stabilise prices.\nAugust saw the 11th increase in rates by the Federal Reserve since early 2022, with rates at their highest for almost two decades.\nIt warned further raises would follow \"if appropriate\". \nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nHow much are prices rising for you?

There are what are known as priority debts and bills because there can be serious consequences if you do not pay them, such as losing your home or facing court proceedings. They should be paid first.\nThey include rent, mortgage repayments, and loans secured on the home, gas and electricity bills, child support and maintenance payments, council tax, income tax, VAT and other taxes, TV licence payments, court fines and payments.\nCalculate how much you can cover in debt repayments. Create a budget by adding up your essential living costs like food and housing, and take these away from any income such as your wage or benefits you receive.\nAfter than move on to looking at other debts, although failure to pay could still lead to the arrival of bailiffs. These are credit cards, store cards, buy-now-pay-later payments, overdrafts, unsecured loans and water bills. Ignoring them would still see the cost of those debts spiral.\nAlways see how you could boost your income, primarily by checking what benefits you are entitled to, and whether you are eligible for a council tax reduction or a lower tariff on your broadband or TV package.\nIt is important that you do talk about financial difficulties before finding yourself in a spiral of debt. The earlier, the better.\nIf you think you cannot pay your debts or are finding dealing with them overwhelming, seek support straight away. You are not alone and there is help available. A trained debt adviser can talk you through the options available.\nInformation and support is available and free of charge - click here to find out about organisations who may be able to help.\nYour supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan first.\nIf you don't agree a plan with your supplier, it has been the case that they might try to force you to have a prepayment meter installed, or they may switch your existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nBut since it emerged that meters were being forcibly fitted into the homes of vulnerable people, companies are now required to pass certain tests before they can switch customers.\nA \"breathing space\" scheme in England and Wales shields people in problem debt from further interest and charges.\nPeople receiving debt advice can apply for the break, which lasts for up to 60 days, to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\nPeople receiving mental health crisis treatment can apply for a scheme which lasts for the length of that treatment, plus another 30 days.\nConsultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium.\nFor some people, there is little or no chance of paying off debts, and so they may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\nThis should only be done after seeking advice. There are different forms of insolvency which may be considered depending on your circumstances and where you live.\nBankruptcy: This is the most serious option, which involves an official receiver being appointed to sell off your assets to pay your debts. If you own a house or a car you may lose them. \nThe bankruptcy will affect your credit record for at least six years. But after one year all your debts will be written off. The procedure currently costs £680, but you can pay in instalments. \nIndividual Voluntary Arrangement: Under an IVA, an insolvency practitioner will help you strike a deal with your creditors, which allows you to pay off your debts over a fixed period - say five years. Once approved, all interest on unsecured debt is frozen. \nThere is less stigma with an IVA, and a greater chance of you keeping your home if you own one.\nDebt Relief Order: This form of insolvency, introduced in 2009, is the easiest of all. Your debts must not exceed £30,000. If your application is accepted, some debts will be frozen for one year, then written off. A DRO costs £90.\nInsolvency in Scotland: If you live in Scotland, bankruptcy is known legally as sequestration.

The cost of living has also been going up, with prices rising at a rate still well above target.\nThat means two things for any money we have set aside. \nFirstly, the returns (or interest) being offered on savings accounts has improved, although borrowing is more expensive. For example, you may find an account paying 5% a year, so £1,000 saved for a year will earn £50 in interest. Save for lots of years, and that lump sum keeps building under what is known as compound interest.\nSecondly, the buying power of the money we do have saved is being diluted by rising prices.\nBank of England figures show that there is £268bn in non-interest paying accounts - which are primarily current accounts. \nExperts say that finding a good savings account for that money will help people benefit from those higher rates, and counter some of the downsides of rising prices.\nInvesting the money is another option, although that carries greater risks.\nHigh energy and food bills mean that, for many people, their money doesn't last until the end of the month. Finding anything to set aside is difficult.\nIf you have debts that need bringing under control, then that is widely considered to be the priority, ahead of any savings decisions.\nHowever, putting some money aside regularly into an emergency savings fund can help avoid serious debt. If your car breaks down, or the children's school shoes need replacing, then it is better to have money available than to borrow it.\nYou also might want to save throughout the year for Christmas or holidays.\nThe general advice is to spend some time going through your finances, then set a savings goal, and to start with saving a small, manageable amount on a regular basis.\nThe Building Societies Association, which runs UK Savings Week, has a guide about how to get started.\nThis is where it can get quite complicated. There are a wide range of savings products available, and your personal circumstances will determine which is best for you.\nThe most basic savings product is an easy-access account. They tend not to have the best interest rates, but you can withdraw your money whenever you like.\nSome accounts such as fixed-term accounts or bonds pay more in interest but your money is locked in for a certain period of time.\nAnyone starting out might consider regular saver accounts, some of which are sold alongside current accounts. Again you might not be able to access the money for a certain period of time and, by starting small, it may take time before any meaningful interest is built up.\nAlso, there are notice accounts, which require you to tell the provider in advance when you plan to withdraw money. Alternatively, you can forgo interest and instead enter a prize draw, such as with Premium Bonds.\nIf you don't have access to a bank account, then credit unions offer the opportunity to save. Savings scheme incentives provided by the government may encourage longer-term savings. particularly for children.\nThere are plenty more and, with such a variety, it is best to shop around. That shouldn't only be for the best interest rate but, perhaps more crucially, to find the account that best suits your needs.\nAnna Bowes, founder of the independent Savings Champion website, says some savers can suffer from \"choice paralysis\", so it might be best to set yourself a deadline when making a decision.\nHelpfully, every account now displays a summary box outlining its key features, which makes it a bit less time-consuming to compare between them.\nDefinitely not. Banks, building societies and other savings providers often advertise eye-catching headline interest rates. Sometimes those deals are only available for a few weeks. \nThe best interest rate may only last on a product for a year, after which it may revert to a much lower rate. So, being loyal may be more convenient, but won't necessarily pay the most. That is why it is best to review old accounts you may have set up years ago.\nIn fact, banks have come under heavy pressure from MPs and regulators to ensure that rates - particularly on easy-access accounts - reflect the wider market and are not just used to make excess profits.\nEvery basic and higher-rate taxpayer has a personal savings allowance, which means you don't pay tax on the first £1,000 of interest you earn from savings (or the first £500 if you're a higher-rate taxpayer).\nIndividual Savings Accounts, known as Isas, allow you to save up to £20,000 a year, and the interest is tax-free.\nLarge amounts held in savings can affect a claim for universal credit.\nIf a bank or building society goes bust, then the first £85,000 per person, per institution is safe and would be refunded.\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is the state pension and the triple lock?\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cost-of-living payments: Who is getting them and when?", "date": "2023-09-19 23:08:29", "text": "Millions of people are receiving payments to help with higher bills, with more to come.\nLow-income households, pensioners and some disabled people are entitled to additional cost-of-living funds after the government extended a scheme it launched in 2022. \nA committee of MPs is currently investigating whether the payments are supporting those most in need.\nSome groups are receiving payments to help with higher bills, including:\nThe first instalment of £301 for those on means-tested benefits was received by about eight million people in late April and June. The next of £300 will be paid between 31 October and 19 November.\nThe payment, in three instalments, is available to households who receive the following benefits: \nThe payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their national insurance number, followed by DWP COL.\nThe 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits, are paid slightly later than others.\nPeople are not eligible for these payments if they receive the new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or the new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.\nAnyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, or report it here.\nTo qualify for the latest instalment, people had to have claimed a benefits payment between 18 August and 17 September, or received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated.\nAn estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments.\nOther eligibility details are outlined here. \nNone of these cost-of-living payments affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive.\nUp to six million people on the following disability benefits received another £150:\nThose payments were made between 20 June and 4 July.\nHouseholds that receive the winter fuel payment - which is worth £200-£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra £300 in November or December 2022, and will get another £300 this coming winter.\nLower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.\nTwo payments totalling £650 were made in 2022 to more than eight million low-income households. \nPayments of £300 were also paid to pensioners during last winter, and a £150 payment was also made to those with disabilities. \nSome people would have received all of those payments, if they were eligible.\nA £150 rebate, often through people's council tax bill, was made last year. The Household Support Fund, which is distributed by local councils, helped vulnerable people, including giving fuel vouchers to those in need.\nAll household energy bills were cut by at least £400 between October and March. \nThe discount was made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales. However, there are no plans to repeat this in the coming winter. \nSeparate arrangements were made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. \nThey received a single payment of £600 starting in January, which was more than in the rest of the UK because a higher proportion of households use heating oil. \nDirect debit customers in Northern Ireland had the money paid into their bank accounts. Other customers were sent a voucher. \nThe Commons Work and Pensions Committee is investigating whether cost-of-living payments have been received by those in most need of help.\nThey are studying whether some have missed out on hundreds of pounds because they are just outside the qualifying criteria, and whether the package as a whole is sufficient for low-income families.\nThe government launched an Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022, which limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500 throughout last winter.\nThe scheme, which applied to England, Wales and Scotland, is still in place if needed, but has not been required since July.\nThat's because a typical bill fell to around £2,074 a year under regulator Ofgem's energy price cap in the summer, and will fall further to £1,923 a year in October.\nA government scheme to cut energy bills for businesses finished at the end of March. \nUnder a new scheme that began in April, firms get a discount on wholesale prices rather than costs being capped as under the previous deal.\nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, get a larger discount than others.\nHow is the rising cost of living affecting you?

{"title": "Renting: What are your rights as a tenant?", "date": "2023-07-21 09:03:12", "text": "Rents are rising at their fastest rate since records began in 2016.\nBut with a quarter of tenants struggling to pay, what are your rights?\nMost tenants have a rental agreement called an assured shorthold tenancy. \nSome of these are \"rolling\" - which means tenants pay rent weekly or monthly, with no fixed end date.\nIn England, the landlord:\nAny rent rise must be fair and realistic, in line with local properties.\nOther renters have a \"fixed\" agreement, which typically runs for six or 12 months.\nThe landlord:\nIf the fixed term is a year, landlords must give six months' notice.\nThere are some other tenancy agreements with different rules.\nThe housing charity Shelter's online tool can help people in England find out what kind of tenancy they have.\nHousing law and renting rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThis video can not be played\nWhat can you do about rent increases? Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute.\nIn England a holding deposit is paid to a landlord to reserve a property.\nIt can't be more than one week's rent.\nYou should get the money back within seven days of signing your tenancy agreement - or it can go towards your rent.\nBut if you decide not to move in, you could lose it. \nIf the landlord doesn't give it back, and you think they should, write to them.\nIf you still don't get a refund, contact one of the letting agent redress schemes.\nYou can also complain in England to Trading Standards through the Citizen's Advice consumer helpline.\nSuch deposits are not legal in Scotland, and rules are different in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords need to follow strict rules if they want a tenant to leave - if not, the eviction could be illegal, or the landlord could be guilty of harassment.\nIn England the landlord has to give written notice to the tenant, which could be: \nOther tenancy contracts have different rules.\nOnce the notice period ends, the landlord can start eviction proceedings through court.\nLandlords can apply for a so-called \"possession order\". If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a \"warrant for possession\".\nEviction rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nTenants in England have the right to \"live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair\". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs.\nHowever, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice.\nIf so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council.\nYour landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council. \nTenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.\nThere are no laws explicitly stopping this, but MPs are considering more protections for renters in England.\nUnder a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a \"well-behaved\" pet, which the landlord can only refuse on reasonable grounds - such as the size of the property.\nHowever, landlords will be able to charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.\nThe law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.\nAt present it could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.\nHowever, BBC News foundalmost a quarter of some 8,000 adverts examined on the property website OpenRent indicated that families were not eligible.\nMore than 300 listings on another property portal, Zoopla, explicitly said children were not wanted, although this was less than 1% of those we looked at.\nSome 73% of sampled OpenRent listings said tenants with pets were not welcome, compared with 6% on Zoopla. \nShelter warned the problem would be even more widespread as sometimes prospective tenants were only told they were not welcome when they applied. \nLandlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.\nIf a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge a tenant more than the amount they pay. \nExhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.
