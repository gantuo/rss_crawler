Las Vegas police (LVMPD) have shared his mugshot.\nGreg Kading, a retired Los Angeles police detective who spent years investigating Shakur's murder, told the Associated Press he is not surprised by Mr Davis' arrest.\"All the other direct conspirators or participants are all dead,\" Mr Kading said, calling Mr Davis \"the last man standing\" in the case. \nIn court, prosecutor Marc DiaGiacomo described Mr Davis - a former leader of the South Side Compton Crips street gang - as the \"on-ground, on-site commander\" who \"ordered the death\" of Shakur.\nAt a news conference later on Friday, police officer Jason Johansson said the force's persistence in the investigation had \"ultimately paid off\", before explaining what led to the breakthrough.\nHe said Orlando Anderson, the suspect's late nephew, and Shakur had been involved in a fight in a casino shortly before the rapper was shot on 7 September 1996. He died in hospital a few days later.\nMr Johansson showed reporters hotel security camera footage of Anderson being beaten. He said this ultimately led to the retaliatory shooting of Shakur as he was waiting in his car at a red light.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: What have the police got on Keffe D?\nThe officer added it became obvious very quickly that this was a gang-related crime, and the case had been reviewed multiple times. \nBut it was not until 2018, when new information came to light, that the case was \"reinvigorated\".\nMr Johansson also mentioned Mr Davis's \"own admissions\" to media outlets that he was in the vehicle where the shots were fired from.\nAt the same press conference, a visibly emotional Sheriff Kevin McMahill said that \"for 27 years the family of Tupac Shakur have been waiting for justice\".\n\"There have been many people who did not believe that the murder of Tupac Shakur was important to this police department. I'm here to tell you: that was simply not the case.\"\n\"Our goal at LVMPD has always been to hold those... responsible for Tupac's violent murder accountable,\" the sheriff added.\nShakur, whose stage name was stylised as 2Pac, released his debut album in 1991. \nOne of the most acclaimed names in hip-hop, his death inspired several documentaries. \nHe sold more than 75 million records worldwide, enjoying chart success with hits including California Love, All Eyez On Me and Changes.\nHe also found success acting in films like Juice, Poetic Justice, Above The Rim, Gridlock'd and Gang Related.\nIn June this year the rapper received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  \nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nTupac police seize hard drives and laptops at house\nTupac to get star on Hollywood Walk of Fame\nSuge Knight says Tupac may be alive\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Sunak vows to stop 20mph zones and review LTNs", "date": "", "text": "Rishi Sunak says he wants to stop \"hare-brained\" road calming and safety schemes, including 20mph zones, to end what he says is a \"war on motorists\".\nThe prime minister said he wanted to ensure such measures would no longer be \"forced\" on drivers.\nThere will also be a review of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, or LTNs, in England to ensure they are not introduced without local support. \nThe Labour Party described the plans as \"pure hypocrisy\".\nThe Department for Transport has also announced plans for a single national parking app in England which will remove the need for motorists to use several different platforms to pay for parking.\nIt comes weeks after the PM delayed the introduction of a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.\nIn an interview with the Sun, Mr Sunak said he was \"slamming the brakes on the war on motorists, it's as simple as that\".\n\"What we want to do now is make sure that all these hare-brained schemes that are forced on local communities, whether it's Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, blanket 20mph speed limits, all of that... need to stop.\"\nHe conceded that 20mph zones near schools \"make sense\" but said they should not be done in a \"blanket way\" - criticising the Welsh government's decision to drop the default speed limit from 30mph to 20mph for restricted roads.\nThe Labour-run Welsh government predicts the change will save up to 100 lives and 20,000 casualties in the first decade.\nLTNs are aimed at reducing traffic in residential streets, and improving access for pedestrians and cyclists with dedicated lanes, wider pavements and planters blocking off vehicle access.\nSpeed limits of 20mph are designed to reduce the severity of injuries suffered in accidents. The implementation of such schemes is the responsibility of local authorities.  \nThe government said its plan would: \nMr Sunak said: \"For too long politicians have focused on the short-term decisions with little regard for the long-term impact on hardworking families.\n\"We've seen this consistently with people's freedoms on transport.\" \nHe claimed a \"clamp down on drivers\" was \"an attack on the day-to-day lives of most people... who rely on cars to get to work or see their families\".\n\"We are taking the necessary decision to back the motorists who keep our country moving.\"\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper underlined that guidance would be strengthened to make it harder for road schemes to be introduced in a blanket way - because doing so \"makes life harder for drivers, doesn't deliver any benefits\" and could instead damage the ability of 20mph speed limits to make people safer, \"because if you put them in inappropriate places, people are less likely to comply even where they make sense\".\nMr Harper also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme\"we want them put in place where they make sense\" such as \"outside a school, or in a heavily built up area where you might have children playing, or where there's a particular issue with accidents\".\nBut writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh posted previous commitments by the Conservatives to LTNs, adding: \"Whose hare-brained idea was it in the first place?\"\n\"It's pure hypocrisy to see Rishi Sunak denounce a policy the Tories have been instrumental in delivering. The only dividing line he has is with his own government.\"\nChief executives of Bikeability Trust, British Cycling, Cycling UK, Living Streets, Ramblers and Sustrans said the government was \"entrenching congestion and reliance on driving for short local journeys\".\n\"This is a plan that looks no further than one way of travelling and will make the roads worse for those occasions when people do need to drive,\" they said.\nThe latest plans follow the prime minister's revision of his government's net zero policies, which delays the ban on new diesel and petrol cars from 2030 to 2035.\nThe move provoked a backlash, with the Climate Change Committee - the government's independent advisers on cutting carbon emissions - saying the UK had \"moved backwards\".\nIt also follows the Conservative Party's narrow byelection victory in Uxbridge, Boris Johnson's former seat, after fighting a campaign focused on local opposition to the expansion of London's ultra-low emission zone.\nHow 20mph row is shaping Sunak's election strategy\nUlez is two-for-one offer for London, mayor says\nLondon council to scrap road closure scheme\nSunak could limit 20mph zones to target driver vote\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Alien life in Universe: Scientists say finding it is 'only a matter of time'", "date": "", "text": "Many astronomers are no longer asking whether there is life elsewhere in the Universe. \nThe question on their minds is instead: when will we find it? \nMany are optimistic of detecting life signs on a faraway world within our lifetimes - possibly in the next few years.\nAnd one scientist, leading a mission to Jupiter, goes as far as saying it would be \"surprising\" if there was no life on one of the planet's icy moons.\nNasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently detected tantalising hints at life on a planet outside our Solar System - and it has many more worlds in its sights.\nNumerous missions that are either underway or about to begin mark a new space race for the biggest scientific discovery of all time. \n\"We live in an infinite Universe, with infinite stars and planets. And it's been obvious to many of us that we can't be the only intelligent life out there,\" says Prof Catherine Heymans, Scotland's Astronomer Royal.\n\"We now have the technology and the capability to answer the question of whether we are alone in the cosmos.\"\nTelescopes can now analyse the atmospheres of planets orbiting distant stars, looking for chemicals that - on Earth at least - can be produced only by living organisms. \nThe first flicker of such a discovery came earlier this month. The possible sign of a gas that, on Earth, is produced by simple marine organisms was detected in the atmosphere of a planet named K2-18b, which is 120 light years away.\nThe planet is in what astronomers call ''the Goldilocks zone' - the right distance away from its star for the surface temperature to be neither too hot nor too cold, but just right for there to be liquid water, which is essential to support life.\nThe team expects to know in a year's time whether the tantalising hints are confirmed or have gone away. \nProf Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University, who led the study, told me that if the hints are confirmed \"it would radically change the way we think about the search for life\". \n\"If we find signs of life on the very first planet we study, it will raise the possibility that life is common in the Universe.\"\nHe predicts that within five years there will be \"a major transformation\" in our understanding of life in the Universe.\nIf his team don't find life signs on K2-18b, they have 10 more Goldilocks planets on their list to study - and possibly many more after that. Even finding nothing would \"provide important insights into the possibility of life on such planets\", he says.\nHis project is just one of many that are under way or planned for the coming years searching for signs of life in the Universe. Some search on the planets in our Solar System - others look much further, into deep space.\nAs powerful as Nasa's JWST is, it has its limits. Earth's size and proximity to the Sun enable it to support life. But JWST wouldn't be able to detect faraway planets as small as Earth (K2-18b is eight times bigger) or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare.  \nSo, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s. Using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield, it minimises light from the star which a planet orbits. That means it will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own.\nAlso coming online later this decade is the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.\nAll three of these atmosphere-analysing telescopes make use of a technique, used by chemists for hundreds of years, to discern the chemicals inside materials from the light they give off. \nThey are so incredibly powerful that they can do this from the tiny pin prick of light from the atmosphere of a planet orbiting a star, hundreds of light years away.\nWhile some look to distant planets, others are restricting their search to our own backyard, to the planets of our own Solar System.\nThe most likely home for life is one of the icy moons of Jupiter, Europa. It is a beautiful world with cracks on its surface that look like tiger stripes. Europa has an ocean below its icy surface, from which plumes of water vapour spew out into space.\nNasa's Clipper and the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) missions will both arrive there in the early 2030s.  \nShortly after the Juice mission was approved in 2012, I asked Prof Michelle Dougherty, who is the lead scientist of the European mission, if she thought there was a chance of finding life. She replied: \"It would be surprising if there wasn't life on one of the icy moons of Jupiter.\"\nNasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan. It is an exotic world with lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze. Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.\nMars is currently too inhospitable for living organisms, but astrobiologists believe that the planet was once lush, with a thick atmosphere and oceans and able to support life.\nNasa's Perseverance rover is currently collecting samples from a crater thought once to have been an ancient river delta. A separate mission in the 2030s will bring those rocks to Earth to analyse them for potential microfossils of simple life forms that are now long gone. \nSome scientists consider this question the realm of science fiction and a long shot, but the search for radio signals from alien worlds has gone on for decades, not least by the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (Seti) institute. \nAll of space is a large place to look, so their searches have been random to date. But the ability of telescopes, such as JWST, to identify the most likely places for alien civilisations to exist means that Seti can focus its search. \nThat has injected fresh impetus, according to Dr Nathalie Cabrol, director of Seti's Carl Sagan Center for the study of life in the Universe. The institute has modernised its telescope array and is now using instruments to look for communications from powerful laser pulses from distant planets.\nAs a highly qualified astrobiologist, Dr Cabrol understands why some scientists are sceptical of Seti's search for a signal.\nBut chemical signatures from faraway atmospheres, interesting readings from moon flybys and even microfossils from Mars are all open to interpretation, Dr Cabrol argues.\nLooking for a signal \"might seem the most far-fetched of all the various approaches to find signs of life. But it would also be the most unambiguous and it could happen at any time\".\n\"Imagine we have a signal that we can actually understand,\" says Dr Cabrol.\nThirty years ago, we had no evidence of planets orbiting other stars. Now more than 5,000 have been discovered, which astronomers and astrobiologists can study in unprecedented detail.  \nAll the elements are in place for a discovery that will be more than just an incredible scientific breakthrough, according to Dr Subhajit Sarker of Cardiff University, who is a member of the team studying K2-18b.\n\"If we find signs of life, it will be a revolution in science and it is also going to be a massive change in the way humanity looks at itself and its place in the Universe.\"\nFollow Pallab on X, formally known as Twitter.\nTantalising sign of possible life on faraway world\nThe amazing images taken by the $10bn telescope\nMystery of planet that escaped death may be solved\nNasa hails 'awesome' recovery of asteroid sample\nNasa picks up 'heartbeat' signal from lost space probe\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

There were no side effects and it was all over very quickly, allowing me to continue living my life to the full,\" he said.\n\"I was treated so rapidly it's hard to come to terms with the fact that I ever had cancer.\"\nHe has annual tests for his PSA levels, which remain extremely low, and says doctors have told him his treatment is likely to have cured him.\nProf van As said he expected that the NHS would \"rapidly adopt\" the lower-dose treatment. \n\"Across the whole NHS that's hundreds of thousands of doses of radiotherapy that are going to be saved,\" he said.\n\"And in a system which is quite under pressure, that's going to be very welcome.\"\nProf van As says an estimated 8,000 men a year might meet the criteria of having intermediate risk prostate cancer which had not spread.\nThey could therefore benefit from the change by having all their treatment in a week rather than spread over at least a month.\nIn the UK, 20 doses of radiotherapy are the standard treatment, but in other countries like the US they use up to 40 doses.\nAnother key element of the trial was that none of the 874 men were given any hormone therapy to block testosterone, a driver of prostate cancer.\nHormone therapy has multiple side effects including severe tiredness, hot flushes and low libido.    \nSimon Grieveson, assistant director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: \"It's fantastic to see that this new type of multi-beam therapy appears to be just as effective as traditional radiotherapy, and could help men get treated more quickly, and with far fewer visits to the hospital.\"\nMr Kennedy-Rose encouraged other men to get checked out.  \n\"It's vital that men over 50 have a routine PSA test, or, if their doctor deems it necessary, an MRI scan,\" he said.\n\"Then, if cancer is found early they can have easy treatment with the fewest side effects, which I fortunately have benefited from.\"\nTurnbull saved lives, says prostate cancer charity\nBBC presenter Nick Owen reveals cancer diagnosis\nHopes MRI scans can screen men for prostate cancer\nSide effects of prostate cancer radiotherapy - Cancer Research UK\nAnnual Meeting - American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Government shutdown only hours away in the US", "date": "", "text": "The US government is on the brink of another shutdown with Congress poised to miss a Saturday midnight deadline to fund federal agencies.\nThe fourth shutdown to occur over the past decade, it could significantly affect everything from air travel to national parks and marriage licenses.\nMost government employees will be furloughed without pay, and crucial nutrition programmes will be halted.\nIt follows a hard-right revolt in the US House of Representatives.\nRepublicans control the House by a slim majority, while Democrats hold the Senate by a single seat.\nThat means spending bills to keep the government open require buy-in from both parties in order to advance through both chambers to President Joe Biden's desk.\nBut a rebel faction of right-wing lawmakers has held up negotiations in the House, the lower congressional chamber, with a demand for significant cuts in spending, including a call for no more US funding of the war in Ukraine. \nReceiving vocal support online from former President Donald Trump, the hard-liners have tanked efforts by Speaker Kevin McCarthy to shepherd legislation needed to break the impasse through the House.\nWhile the Speaker could ostensibly turn to Democrats for the votes he would need to approve a spending measure, it is a move that would likely trigger an effort by the rebel faction to oust him from his plum leadership post.\nMr McCarthy has also refused to take up a short-term funding bill making its way through the Senate. The bill, which includes $6bn (£4.9bn) for Ukraine and $6bn for disaster aid, is a last-ditch effort to avert a lengthy shutdown and appears to have strong bipartisan support in the upper chamber.\nOn Friday, House Republicans' short-term funding measure, which included strict border policies championed by the hardliners, was rejected by as many as 21 members of the party and failed to pass.\nIn a closed-door meeting, Mr McCarthy said that Republicans would have to opt for the House bill or the Senate's version, or risk being blamed for a shutdown.\nBut the rebel lawmakers asserted they would not budge for anything less than a long-term spending bill with their priorities addressed.\n\"This take it or leave it or I'll blame you won't work on us,\" South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace, a moderate who voted against the House bill on Friday, wrote on X.\n\"I'm in this for the long run and have no problem taking on DC to do it.\"\nChuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, slammed Mr McCarthy for bringing up \"truly radical\" proposal that could not make it through both chambers.\n\"The Speaker needs to abandon his doomed mission of trying to please [Republican] extremists,\" he said.\nThe White House backed Mr Schumer's calls for the House to get behind his spending bill.\n\"The path forward to fund the government has been laid out by the Senate with bipartisan support - House Republicans just need to take it,\" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote in a statement on Friday.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: \"The failure of House Republicans to act responsibly would hurt American families and cause economic headwinds that could undermine the progress we're making.\"\nMs Yellen warned that \"key government functions\", including loans to farmers and small businesses, food and workplace safety inspections, and major infrastructure improvements would all be affected.\nShutdowns take place when Congress is unable to approve the roughly 30% of the federal budget it must approve before the start of each fiscal year on 1 October.\nThis means that, on Monday, hundreds of thousands of federal workers except those deemed \"essential\" will be at home without pay. Many of these employees live paycheque to paycheque, according to the American Federation of Government Employees. \nMore than 1.4 million active-duty members of the military and tens of thousands of air traffic controllers will be among those working, without pay.\nIt is a troubling development for any federal workers holding student loan debt. Loan repayments for over 40 million people will restart on Sunday after being paused since the start of the pandemic.\nThe shutdown will also have an immediate impact on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which provides grocery assistance to seven million pregnant women and new mothers.\nA prolonged shutdown could also affect the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a grocery benefit known as \"food stamps\" that serves 40 million low-income Americans, and hinder the implementation of a new programme to serve free breakfast and lunch to students in high-need school districts.\nMuseums, national parks, research facilities and communities health centres with federal government oversight or funding are likely to suspend operations for the period of the shutdown.\nAdditionally, the government agency at the helm of relief and recovery from natural disasters is currently scrambling to conserve cash in the event a shutdown collides with an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. \nBudget disputes that cause this kind of disruption do not occur anywhere else in the world and has been criticised as an example of Washington's growing dysfunction and partisan divides.\nThe last government shutdown, under Mr Trump in 2019, lasted a record 34 days.\nIt erased $11bn in economic output, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and federal workers were seen standing in line at food banks.\nEighteen ways the US shutdown is hurting\nWhat happens in a US government shutdown?\nKevin McCarthy's job on the line as shutdown looms\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "David Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than when I was young’", "date": "", "text": "The United Kingdom is becoming less and less united, says historian David Olusoga - not just along its borders but within each of its four nations. How can the union's ties be renewed? \n\"London's much more dominant than it was when I was growing up,\" Mr Olusoga says. \"In the 1970s, Britain was a much more equal society than it is today.\"\nFew other capital cities have a profile as powerful as the UK's, he says.\n\"Most nations have a capital city that is not enormously out of scale with the other cities.\"\nOlusoga says London's dominance shows how divisions in the UK's union do not just run along borders but within nations themselves.\nThe historian - who has a new BBC Two series about the story of the union of the UK - grew up during the de-industrialisation of north-east England in the 1980s. The closure of factories, coal mines and shipyards swept across the region, causing widespread job losses and unemployment.\nMore than half a century later, it is not possible - he says - to \"rely on industry spreading wealth and opportunity around the four nations\".\n\"We talk about left behind towns. We talk about levelling up,\" he says.\n\"The urgency of doing something, I think, is apparent to many people, journalists, politicians, and whether we can rise to that challenge and in some ways, renew our bonds, renew the union.\n\"That is one of the big questions of the next decades.\"\nIn fact, when he thinks about the attitudes of the people around him as he grew up, the historian says they speak to one of the great tensions of the UK union.\n\"We absolutely felt that the south was another nation. I felt much more in common with Scotland than I did with the south of England, and London seemed like a very disinterested, and at times, sort of very hostile force,\" he says.\n\"I never imagined I'd live in the south, and I do,\" says Olusoga. \"My younger self would be absolutely shocked by that.\"\nWhen choosing universities, the historian - who was brought up in Gateshead - said his \"number one criteria was that I didn't want to go to the south\".\nHe opted to study at Liverpool University. But since then, he says it has become even more apparent that there is \"a concentration of wealth and opportunity in one corner of one country\".\nSome historians have called the years between 1945 and 1973 \"peak union\", because of the impact of free healthcare through the NHS, and the broad spread of industry around the UK.\nOlusoga pinpoints 1973 as the \"high water mark\" of UK equality.\nThere are also other forces on which the union was built, that Olusoga says have either disappeared or are in decline.\n\"I think one of the oddities of the history of the United Kingdom is that here is a state that was largely brought together - with Ireland being a very different story - by the idea of the Protestant faith,\" he says.\nYet the UK is now one of the most secular nations in the world - there's a great contradiction in the fact that a nation formed along religious lines is now very irreligious, he says.\nFewer than half of the population in England and Wales described themselves as Christian in the 2021 census. The drop to 46.2% was down from 59.3% in the 2011 census. \nThe results also saw an increase in the percentage of people who said they had no religion. Censuses in Scotland and Northern Ireland have also recorded a rise in the number of people identifying with no religion.\nRecognition that the bonds that tie the union together needed to be strengthened occurred in the 1990s, says Olusoga. Governing powers were devolved to national parliaments, with the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament or Senedd Cymru, and Northern Ireland Assembly.\nBut it was the independence referendum in Scotland in 2014 that was probably the most fractious moment in the story of the union in recent years, he says. Scotland voted against becoming an independent country by 55% to 45%.\nTwo years later, a referendum about whether or not to stay in another union, the European Union, was bound to raise questions about the union of the UK, he says, \"because two nations voted one way and the other two voted the other way\".\nThe Brexit debate not only highlighted the different attitudes towards the EU across the UK, but also ambivalence towards the union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland - according to a recent Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) report.\n\"It's a very complicated picture, in which, very often, there's sort of tolerance rather than enthusiasm for the status quo,\" says Olusoga. And this, he adds, is set against the backdrop of public faith in UK politics being \"at a low ebb\".\nSo if the historical forces that brought the union together are in decline, could our generation become the last of the Brits?\n\"I don't know. I think there are forces pulling in both directions,\" says Olusoga.\n\"There's a huge demographic shift in Scotland, for example, that's in favour of independence, but we've just seen a decline in support for the SNP,\" he says.\nIt would be dangerous to suggest a union that's lasted for such a long time is on the verge of collapse, he adds, \"because I think history often shows those sorts of presumptions are wrong. But at the same time, it is only [102] years since part of the union did leave.\"\nIn 1921, Northern Ireland officially came into existence after a decision was made to split the island of Ireland in two. \nThis followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom.\nWe are living through a period of astonishing change, says Olusoga.\n\"It'll be fascinating to see how we resolve this current moment and if there is a way of renewing the union.\"\nUnion with David Olusoga is on Mondays at 21:00 BST on BBC Two, or watch on BBC iPlayer\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The Papers: 'PM eyes motorists' vote' and 'Coach crash tragedy'", "date": "", "text": "The Daily Telegraph reports that Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been seeking a meeting with Home Secretary Suella Braverman to raise concerns about her rhetoric on immigration. \nBut he is said to have been \"rebuffed\" in what the paper calls an \"apparent snub\". The details are from parliamentary magazine The House which has carried out an investigation into relations between the Conservatives and the Church of England. \nA source tells the Telegraph there is \"shock\" in Lambeth Palace about the home secretary's reported refusal to meet, which they describe as \"a big slap in the face\". Government sources say there had been one informal approach to seek a meeting.\nThe Guardian reports that almost £600m of public money has already been spent buying up land and homes in northern England to make way for the HS2 rail line, in spite of the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Birmingham to Manchester section. \nThe paper says more than £150m has gone towards buying property on the eastern leg to Leeds, which was paused nearly two years ago. One local mayor in south Yorkshire tells the paper the purchases have caused huge uncertainty.\nThe Daily Mail leads on a poll it has commissioned, the results of which - according to the paper = show Rishi Sunak has a path to victory at the next general election, citing support support for the PM's green agenda, his Rwanda migrant policy and that the respondents also want tax cuts and inheritance tax to be abolished. \nThe paper says these policies create \"clear blue water\" with Labour, suggesting the election's a long way from a foregone conclusion. A thousand people took part in the poll, which was carried out in the last two days. \nIn his interview with the Times, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt says he wants to tackle what the paper calls the spiralling cost of public services. \nAll departments will apparently be told to identify savings by reducing the number of routine tasks carried out by staff such as doctors and police officers. One example given by Mr Hunt is that teachers could use artificial intelligence to mark papers. \nAnd with the Conservative conference starting tomorrow, Transport Secretary Mark Harper tells the Daily Express he's going to halt what the paper terms \"the anti-car campaign of the metropolitan elite\". \nThe front page of the Daily Mirror shows the school bus that overturned on the M53 yesterday, along with a picture of the teenager who died in the crash, Jessica Baker. \nThe paper describes a horrific scene, with children jumping out of smashed windows in the immediate aftermath. One woman tells the Mirror her daughter was on another bus \"by sheer luck\" and will be getting \"one hell of a hug when she gets home\". \nThe Guardian carries an ultimatum that has been made by the authorities in Paris: that a \"bedbug crisis\" in France must be tackled before next year's Olympics. The paper says a wave of panic and disgust has spread across the country, with travellers sharing photos of the creatures on high speed rail lines, the Paris Metro and Charles de Gaulle airport. \nThey had disappeared from daily life in the 1950s, the Guardian explains, but are returning, with increased resistance to chemical treatments. There is a plea for a national taskforce, with one Paris politician warning \"no-one is safe\". \nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nDaily Express\nDaily Mail\nDaily Mirror\nDaily Star\nDaily Telegraph\nFinancial Times\nGuardian\nIndependent\nMetro\nMorning Star\nSun\nTimes\nThe i\n© 2023 BBC.

What do you do?\nIf you're Mae Muller, you put on a brave face for the outside world and record a TikTok making light of the loss.\nThe 10-second clip, captioned \"when someone asks me how well I did at Eurovision\" - ends with the 26-year-old miming \"ask me another question\".\nBut it wasn't the whole story.\n\"When I made that TikTok I was still spiralling\", Mae tells BBC Newsbeat.\nFinishing in 25th place, a year after UK entry Sam Ryder almost won the contest, had left Mae upset and hurt.\n\"I was like, 'Oh my God, my life is over',\" she says.\n\"But I knew I had to address it in my own way.\" \nMae says it was part of her coping mechanism, an attempt to own the narrative about that night in Liverpool back in May.\n\"I didn't want it to be a 'doom and gloom moment' because I can't deal with people pitying me,\" she says.\n\"The second I did that, everyone laughed it off with me and it highlighted it's not the end of the world.\" \nReflecting on the contest she now chooses to focus on the support she received.\n\"I really felt people were on my side,\" she says. \n\"I had so much fun with the fans and despite the pressure, I was able to be myself.\"\nShe's also proud of how her entry - I Wrote a Song - went down outside the Eurovision arena. \nIt picked up tonnes of airplay, more than eight million streams on Spotify and landed in the UK top 10.\n\"When that happened I had to force myself to take it in,\" says Mae.\n\"I was in a bit of a cloud but I'd wanted it for so long, so I had to give myself those flowers.\"\nMae says she loves writing songs, describing it as a way \"to process emotions and feelings\".\nBut even though her Eurovision entry was about doing just that, the demands of the contest meant she had to press pause.\n\"I had no time to write so I didn't write a song for six months,\" she says.\n\"I didn't have the mental capacity because it was so all-consuming. So I was like I'm going to put writing on the back burner and just focus on what's in front of me.\"\nLuckily for Mae her new album - Sorry I'm Late - was already in the bag. Initially due for release in March, her team had to postpone it after she became the UK's Eurovision entry. \nIt's a decision she says has helped her in the long run.\n\"After coming out of Eurovision, it meant I wasn't twiddling my thumbs. I had a whole album to promote so we had to keep going\".\nIf you're a fan of UK pop, you might be able to pick up on some of Mae's influences, including Lily Allen.\nShe says the singer's Alright Still was her favourite album growing up, one she \"listened to on repeat a million times\".\nAnd like Lily, Mae's songs feature candid and comedic lyrics.\n\"Once I started writing my own, that's kind of what I wanted to do. And also naturally what kind of came out.\n\"I now want my songs to be conversational and something you and your friends would would say to each other,\" she says.\nThe release has been a long time coming, so much so, Mae says she can't believe it's actually happening.\n\"It feels very real, but it doesn't feel real. I'm so proud of it and just excited to know that people are gonna listen.\"\nAnd now that the album is out, she's keen to \"get back into the studio\".\n\"I've missed that.

{"title": "What could Rishi Sunak's British baccalaureate look like?", "date": "", "text": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is considering introducing a \"British baccalaureate\" in what would be a major reform of post-16 education. \nMr Sunak might set out more about his plans at the Conservative Party conference, which starts on Sunday. \nSo what is a baccalaureate and what could a British version look like? \nThe word is a slight tweak of the French word for their national academic qualification, the baccalauréat.\nThe International Baccalaureate (IB), which first started in Switzerland, is taken in more than 150 countries.\nIt is an alternative to A-levels and other post-16 courses, and qualifies students to work in certain areas or move on to another professional qualification or training course. \nFor those who want to go to university, the points they receive convert to Ucas points. \nStudents taking a baccalaureate study a wider range of subjects than for A-levels. \nThe proposal for England is being called a British baccalaureate to differentiate it from the current English baccalaureate, which is a separate set of subjects at GCSE level.\nWe don't have the exact details of Rishi Sunak's proposals yet. \nBut we do know it would involve students taking a wider range of subjects, and studying some form of maths and English until they are 18 - something the prime minister really wants.\nA British baccalaureate, modelled on the IB, was the key recommendation of the Times Education Commission, which examined the whole education system in 2022.\nThe Commission suggested two ways a British baccalaureate could work:\nSir Anthony Seldon, who came up with the idea for the commission, believes it is \"highly likely\" Rishi Sunak's proposals will be similar, and would give students \"a broader understanding\" rather than specialising in three subjects.\nTom Richmond, director of the EDSK education think tank, believes Mr Sunak's proposals will be aimed more at an academic route than a vocational one. \nEDSK previously recommended a three-year baccalaureate which would involve academic, applied and Technical subjects to replace all A-levels, BTecs, T-Levels and apprenticeships. \nIf it does become a reality, the level of funding would determine how widely it is offered.\nThe IB, for example, is only available in around 40 state schools in England and Scotland - there are more than 20,000 in total. \nIt is more common in private schools. As EDSK's Tom Richmond says, baccalaureates can be expensive to run as they are \"much more resource intensive\" - they include more subjects, an extended essay, and some kind of personal or community service.\nHe says moving an entire country to a different system would be \"an enormous undertaking\" and could take years. \nHe adds that A-levels are so well respected that any alternative must be \"a very compelling offer to students and parents\". \nEducation is devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so decisions in each nation are taken by devolved governments.\nBill Jones, executive principal at Leeds City College, is open-minded about a new qualification framework, but says the current IB doesn't suit some students who want a more specialist route. \n\"If you are a scientist and are really good at physics and chemistry, [in the IB] you are then judged on your ability in some of the arts and humanities subjects, so your overall score might be too low to get into your university of choice\", he adds. \nMillie, 16, from Cheshire, is keen on the idea and says more state schools should have access to a baccalaureate. \n\"I live over in Blacon, which used to be the biggest council estate in Europe, and I wouldn't have had the opportunity to come to an IB school if it wasn't fully funded\", she explains.\nMillie is taking a broad range of subjects as part of her IB at Chester International School - including maths, English, Spanish, biology, chemistry and psychology.\nMany A-level students only choose three subjects and suddenly realise that for their next step, they need a subject they don't have or that they need maths or English, she says. \nMillie's family took some convincing as they \"didn't really understand doing double the amount of subjects\" - but they now think \"the programme is really good\". \nHowever Joel, 17, is not so sure. He is really enjoying his A-levels of English, history and religious studies at Leeds City College.\nJoel doesn't like the idea of the baccalaureate as he feels it would have restricted his choices.\n\"It was always my intention to drop maths after GCSE\", he says. \"I don't think it is that important and I think GCSE maths is enough for me personally.\"\nHe believes there are \"loads of options\" in the current post-16 education system: \"I don't think there is any need to change it.\"\nPM considers radical shake-up of A-levels\nSix takeaways from A-level and other Level 3 results\nManchester Baccalaureate will give choice - mayor\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Healthy dogs may be put to sleep after bully XL ban - charity", "date": "", "text": "This video can not be played\nPeople are worried about losing their homes due to the American bully XL ban\nThe ban on American bully XL dogs could lead to a rise in the number of healthy dogs being put down, a charity has warned.\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the American bully XL dog will be banned, following a spate of recent attacks.\nHope Rescue, which runs a dog shelter in south Wales, says they will face having to put to sleep perfectly happy, healthy dogs because it could be illegal to re-home a banned breed.\nAnd while many have welcomed the ban, some animal charities are worried about the effects it may have at a time of already high demand on their services.\nRob Mitchell, CEO of the National Animal Welfare Trust (NAWT), says a \"perfect storm\" of pressures are creating a difficult time for animal rescue and re-homing charities.\nNAWT operates five rehoming centres in England. They have seen an increase in their energy bills, vet fees and staffing costs at the same time as financial pressure on their supporters has made fundraising more difficult. \nMr Mitchell says all of his centres are operating waiting lists due to an increase in demand from owners seeking to give up their pet to the charity. \n\"We are actually dealing with less animals because they are coming in with more complex health and behavioural problems which take up more of the staff's time and mean that they are with us longer than we have seen historically,\" he told the BBC. \nLike many other charities, since the American bully XL ban was announced NAWT report an increase in phone calls from owners who are concerned about what the future may hold for their dogs.\nMr Mitchell says it will be \"very difficult\" to re-home American bully XLs if they are on the banned list as people will be reluctant to take on the additional work and will be wary of all dogs from this breed being aggressive.\nUnder a ban, there will not be a cull of American bully XLs, but the government will instead adopt an \"amnesty\" approach, whereby owners will have to register their dogs. The dogs will also need to be neutered, muzzled when out in public and on a lead and insured.\nWith many dog owners looking for more information on how the ban will affect them, some people have set up training events to help. \nVeterinary nurse, Fay Alsworth, says there has been \"fear and confusion\" from dog owners since the ban was announced. \nShe has organised an event which will bring together a group of professionals, including police dog handlers, dog legislation officers and canine behaviourists. Also present will be the owner of a currently banned breed to explain how this impacts their life and their dogs.         \nThis video can not be played\nDog trainer Maddie Bell-Ashe describes the impact of the American bully XL ban\nMaddie Bell-Ashe, a trainer from TLC Dog Academy and Walking, near Milton Keynes, runs muzzle training classes and has shared information online on what the ban may mean for owners. \n\"I've been getting enquiries from Glasgow to Devon with people asking for help,\" she says. \"People are getting really overwhelmed.\n\"A bit more education, more support, more people invested in helping the dogs could help.\"\nShe says that \"nobody knows\" if their dog will fall under the ban until the breed definition is announced by the government.    \nSara Rosser, Operations Manager at Hope Rescue, thinks \"people may panic\" if their dog unexpectedly falls under the American bully XL ban and that this will lead to dogs being abandoned. \n\"Many rescues are already full,\" she says. \"We're already working at over capacity. We're having to hire private boarding kennels as well as [use] our own rescue centre kennels and our foster homes.\"\nShe thinks that a rise in abandoned dogs would put the whole system under strain and lead to difficult decisions.  \n\"Will we still be able to help stray dogs? Are we going to end up in a situation where actually we're having to euthanise more dogs because they can't be re-homed?\"\nMrs Rosser adds that this outcome could lead to further issues for rescue centres in retaining staff.\n\"If you're a dog-lover, are you going to want to work in an environment where you may have to put to sleep happy, healthy dogs? No.\" \nWhat is an American bully XL and why are they being banned?\nBully XL owners scared to go out, says dog trainer\nPM: American bully XL dogs to be banned in UK\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Luton Town: Did a football club's success help reduce crime?", "date": "", "text": "Earlier this year Luton Town won promotion to the Premier League. At the same time, crime across the town reduced markedly. Could these two facts possibly be related?\nDuring the Hatters' promotion-winning season, many people living in Luton described how it had \"brought people together\" as \"one big town\" and \"one big community\".\nSome said the \"feel-good factor\" that swept through the town during the club's rise through the league table made them feel both happier and safer. Were they right?\nNow that crime data for the periods before, during and after the Hatters' promotion run has been published, the BBC decided to look at what impact, if any, the club's success might have had on crime levels.\nOverall crime was down every single month on the previous year during the promotion-winning season.\nWhile we do not know the cause of the fall, the figures do not surprise Luton's Labour mayor and Hatters fan, Yaqub Hanif.\n\"With sporting success, people's wellbeing is improved,\" he says.\n\"When England gets knocked out of the World Cup there is often an increase in domestic violence - it makes sense that the reverse might be true.\"\nThe number of violent crimes reported in Luton was down 12% year-on-year, criminal damage was down 11% and anti-social behaviour down 10%.\n\"I've always thought football is really the official religion of this country because it brings people together - it really has a way of unifying people,\" says Mr Hanif.\n\"We are a one-club town and it is symbolic of what the town is about.\"\nBedfordshire Police is more circumspect about the reasons for the fall in crime.\nA force spokesman says while there \"might be an element of truth\" to the suggestion that crime dropped as a result of a town-wide \"feel good factor\", there are \"a lot of other factors to consider\".\nWhile the force does not elaborate on what those other factors might have been, the College of Policing says many factors can play a part in cutting crime, including new policing initiatives and increasing the number of officers on the street (Bedfordshire has nearly 200 more officers than in 2020).\nLike the police force, football expert Dr David Webber is suspicious of any suggested link between Luton's promotion and the drop in crime.\n\"I suspect you can read what you want into these figures,\" says Dr Webber, a senior research fellow and football studies lecturer at Solent University in Southampton.\n\"At the same time I am a massive believer in football being able to produce improvements in local communities. It is a kind of social glue.\"\nAnd he does feel the Hatters' route to the Premier League - having climbed from non-League football and with no big financial backers - was something out of the ordinary.\n\"We almost always know, roughly, which team is is going to win the title each season - there is an inevitability about it,\" he says.\n\"Luton, however, completely flips this - they did it the hard way.\"\nDespite the near-impossible task of proving it, he says it is possible that the club's journey last year made some people less likely to commit a crime.\nAnother expert, Dr David Buil-Gil, a senior lecturer in quantitative criminology at the University of Manchester, says: \"It is a beautiful idea, and it is possible.\n\"As a football fan myself - Barcelona - I know football brings joy and it can bring tears.\"\nHe says a vast trove of research has established links between crime and a variety of social and economic factors.\nSo, if poverty and a lack of social cohesion can increase crime, is it not possible that football success might reduce it?\nA self-described methodologist, Dr Buil-Gil says the starting point is to look at the numbers and acknowledge that crime data is a \"human construct\" that can be influenced by changes in policy or recording practices over time.\n\"The next thing is to look further,\" he says. \"Has crime just fallen in Luton or more widely, across the whole of Bedfordshire or further afield?\"\nLooking at the same three-year period across all of Bedfordshire, overall crime in 2022-23 did drop, both year-on-year and compared with two years ago.\nHowever, not the drop is not as pronounced as in Luton, and when Luton is removed from the Bedfordshire data, year-on-year crime actually increases during four of the 12 months.\nDr Buil-Gil says a longer time frame would be needed in order to look for trends and blips.\nAnd even if there were signs that promotion had played some role in its reduction in crime, he says, has anything similar been found anywhere else?\nThe BBC asked Leicestershire Police what happened to the crime level in Leicester during the city's Premier League winning run in 2015-16.\nThe force's press office said it did not have any statistics to hand and that nothing was brought to its attention either at the time or since.\nAs for Dr Buil-Gil, he says both the football-crime question and the intellectual journey that would be required towards providing a credible answer has him intrigued.\nSo intrigued, in fact, that he might offer up the Luton Town question for some of his students to grapple with.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

{"title": "US urges Serbia to withdraw troops from Kosovo border as tensions rise", "date": "", "text": "The US is urging Serbia to withdraw what it says is a large military build-up on the country's border with Kosovo.\nIt follows an attack last Sunday during which some 30 gunmen were involved in a gun battle with Kosovo police in the Serb-majority northern Kosovo.\nIn the past months, tensions have been rising between Kosovo's minority ethnic Serb and majority Albanian communities.\nIn response to the \"current situation\", the UK said it was sending troops to join Nato peacekeepers there.\nThe military alliance said it was ready to increase its forces following a stand-off at a monastery in the north last Sunday in which a Kosovo policeman and three of the attackers were killed.\nIn the aftermath, Kosovo's government displayed a large arsenal of weapons and equipment and accused Serbia's government of backing the incident. \nOn Friday, Milan Radoicic, the vice president of Serb List, the main Kosovo-Serb political party, resigned after admitting to organising the armed group. However, he denied receiving any help from Belgrade.  \nSpeaking on Friday, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby described the \"large military deployment\" of Serbian sophisticated tanks and artillery as \"a very destabilising development\".\n\"It's worrisome. It doesn't look like just a bunch of guys who got together to do this,\" Mr Kirby said, referring to the attackers.\n\"We are calling on Serbia to withdraw those forces from the border.\"\nMr Kirby said the build-up of troops had happened within the last week, but its purpose was not yet clear.\nHe added that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had telephoned Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to urge \"immediate de-escalation and a return to dialogue\".\nMr Kirby also said that US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to Kosovo's Prime Minister, Albin Kurti.\nMr Vucic has not directly denied there has been a recent build-up of troops but rejected claims that his country's forces were on alert.\n\"I have denied untruths where they talk about the highest level of combat readiness of our forces, because I simply did not sign that and it is not accurate,\" Mr Vucic said.\n\"We don't even have half the troops we had two or three months ago.\"\nStrained tensions between the two countries were inflamed on Sunday after a Kosovan policeman and three ethnic Serbian gunmen died during a siege of a Serbian Orthodox monastery in Banjska village on Sunday.\nThe deadly clash marks one of the gravest escalations in Kosovo for years, and follows months of mounting tension between the two sides.\nAfter the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo - a province of the former country - sought independence.\nSerbia responded with a brutal crackdown against ethnic Albanians.\nThis ended in 1999 with a Nato bombing campaign against Serbia, between March and June.\nSerbian forces withdrew from Kosovo - but for many Kosovo Albanians and Serbs, the conflict has never been resolved.\nKosovo declared independence in 2008 but Serbia - along with Belgrade's key allies China and Russia - does not recognise it.\nMany Serbs consider it the birthplace of their nation. But of the 1.8 million people living in Kosovo, 92% are ethnic Albanians and only 6% are ethnic Serbs.\nAs tensions continue to rise, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday that he had \"authorised additional forces to address the current situation\".\nIt is the second time in three months that Nato has bolstered its forces in the country.\nThere are currently around 4,500 Nato-led Kosovo Force (KFor) personnel stationed in the country. \nOn Friday, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it had made a battalion of between 500 and 650 troops available to KFor.\nThe MoD said the troops had recently arrived in the region for long-planned exercises.\nWhy is violence flaring again in Kosovo?\nKosovo and Serbia row over monastery gun battle\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

They are:\nThe strikes coincide with the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester which begins on Sunday.\nThe rail industry is likely to be a subject of discussion as speculation mounts that the Birmingham to Manchester leg of HS2 rail link may be scrapped.\nNetwork Rail has advised of \"significant disruption\", with services also likely to start later on the day immediately following a full strike day.\nIt said that customers with advance, anytime or off-peak tickets for travel on Saturday can use their tickets up to and including Tuesday, 3 October.\nNetwork Rail also said there is a fee-free refund or exchange available for those who choose not to travel on strike days. It added that there is cross-industry ticket acceptance between different train companies and temporary removal of \"certain ticket restrictions\".\nWith more than a dozen train companies affected, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) - which represents train companies - said its offer for improved worker pay remained on the table. It said its offer was reasonable, claiming that it would bring average driver salaries from £60,000 to £65,000.\nAslef rejected proposals in April, which involved pay rises of 4% two years in a row, in exchange for changes to ways of working. The union has argued that drivers are being asked to sacrifice their working conditions in exchange for a below-inflation pay rise.\nAslef and the RMT union, which represents other rail workers, have held a series of strikes since last summer which have brought much of the network to a standstill. \nSeparately, there will be strikes on London Underground by RMT union members on Wednesday, 4 October and Friday, 6 October.\nAre you a striking rail worker?

{"title": "Sudan conflict: Living in Cairo, longing for Omdurman", "date": "", "text": "BBC Arabic reporter Mohamed Osman has returned to his home country, Sudan, for the first time since he was forced to flee after war broke out in April, and reflects on how the country has changed.\nAfter longing for home for five months, even the hot, humid air of the coastal city of Port Sudan felt refreshing on my face. \nI was finally home - not a foreigner or a refugee in another country, in this case Egypt -  a nation with which we, Sudanese, have strong ties. Most people from the two countries speak the same language, eat the same food, belong to the same faith - and even share the River Nile. \nBut it is not home. \nAn elderly woman, who was on the same flight as me, was far more emotional, crying with joy when we stepped on to Sudanese soil, as she recalled how she went to Egypt for medical treatment - and got stuck there once Sudan plunged into a civil war in April. \nThe conflict was triggered by a dispute between its two powerful generals - military ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Burhan and his deputy-turned rival, Mohamed Dagalo, who is better known as Hemedti.  \nI had come for a brief visit to Port Sudan, as my hometown, Omdurman, is still wrecked by war. My heart ached that I could not return to it. \nOmdurman is a hotbed of violence, claiming the lives of many innocent people, including a close friend who was hit by stray bullets in his home as fighting raged between government troops and Gen Dagalo's Rapid Support Forces (RSF). \nAs for the woman who was with me on the plane, she had come back for good, as her home town - in the state of Gezira - is peaceful, at least for now. \nWe had both caught the two-hour flight from Egypt's capital Cairo to Port Sudan. It was the first passenger plane to fly into Sudan since war broke out.\nPort Sudan's airport is the only one that has opened. The rest remain shut - including the main international airport in Khartoum, as the capital city - like Omdurman across the River Nile - is hit by air strikes, gun-battles and artillery fire every day. \nThere are now daily flights to Port Sudan - all fully booked, mostly with elderly people, returning to small towns and villages that have not been scarred by battles. \nYoung and poorer Sudanese are also returning in the handful of buses that leave Egypt each day. Sometimes, they spend three days on the road to reach their homes, as Sudan is a vast country, and does not have the best of roads. \nThey found life in Egypt tough, as there are no UN-run refugee camps to provide them with shelter and food - unlike Chad, which hosts the highest number of Sudanese refugees, about 420,000, while Egypt has about 320,000, according to official statistics. \nI spent about two weeks in Port Sudan, which has turned into the alternative capital of Sudan, with the war forcing Gen Burhan to relocate to the city as the RSF controls large parts of Khartoum, including key government buildings. \nHe had been besieged in the military headquarters in Khartoum until August, when he managed to leave. The RSF has since been carrying out a major assault to take control of the building. \nThe fear is that Sudan could end up with two rival governments - one set up by Gen Dagalo in Khartoum, and another by Gen Burhan in Port Sudan.\nGen Burhan's ministers - or minister designates - have also settled in Port Sudan, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking the city's authorities to grant it land on which it can build its headquarters. Many diplomatic missions and United Nations agencies have also moved to Port Sudan - a strategically important city along the shipping routes of the Red Sea. \nThough largely peaceful, the city was hit by fighting just over a week ago when government troops tried to remove checkpoints set up by an ethnic militia. \nIt raised fears that the war could spread to the city, but government forces have so far kept control, manning their own checkpoints, carrying out patrols and enforcing an 23:00-06:00 curfew.\nThere are now also power cuts of several hours every day, forcing businesses and homes to use generators that have worsened air pollution and noise levels in the coastal city, a popular holiday destination until war broke out. \nThe corniche - which was at the heart of night life where friends and lovers used to meet - is no longer as bustling as it used to be. \nFood shop owner Ibrahim Taha said he had been forced to shut his business, as costs increased while his clientele fell. He is now unemployed. \nAnother restaurant owner, who specialises in \"al-Aqashi,\" a popular meal of mostly meat grilled on thin skewers, said the war forced him to shut his business in Khartoum, and relocate to Port Sudan.\n\"I suffered great losses in Khartoum, after the RSF took control of the al-Amarat neighbourhood, where my restaurant is located, and so I decided to leave for Port Sudan,\" he said, adding that despite the constant power cuts and rising costs he was thinking of opening other branches as demand for his food was high.\nPort Sudan has become home to hundreds of families who fled fighting in Khartoum. Some of them live in harsh and overcrowded conditions in schools and government buildings, with a lack of food, healthcare, and clean drinking water. \nOne woman, Batoul Tayya, said she and her children had moved out of their shelter, \"thanks to a generous benefactor who gave us housing\".\n\"The situation in the shelter was extremely difficult, so I decided to leave with my family and start selling tea,\" she said. \nHer story - like that of many others - was a painful reminder of a war that has ruined in the lives of millions of people. \nWe all hope that the conflict ends soon so that our lives can return to normal. \nI am now back in Cairo, and life further north along the River Nile, is just not the same.\nI long for Omdurman, to walk by the White Nile, to sit under its trees, and to sip tea while chatting to relatives and friends - reuniting with them and remembering those we lost in the war. \nBBC reporter: My heartbreaking decision to leave Sudan\nMy family buried my grandmother while ducking bullets\nSudan's army: Outnumbered on Khartoum's streets\nWhat is going on in Sudan?

{"title": "Green Party plans to double membership fees amid legal woes", "date": "", "text": "A bitter legal battle could blow a hole in the Green Party of England Wales's general election campaign funds.\nThe BBC understands courts could force the party to pay between £200,000 and £400,000 if it loses a case against former deputy leader Dr Shahrar Ali.\nThe party's financial auditors note the case has left \"uncertainty\" about its ability to keep running normally.\nThe Greens are proposing a 50% increase in membership fees to build funds.\nIf voted through at the Green Party Conference next week, the cost of being a member will rise from £3.33 a month to £5 a month, with a £6 a year fee for concessions.\nDr Ali, an academic who was joint deputy leader of the party between 2014 and 2016, is a prominent critic of the Green Party's official stance on gender issues.\nHe has stood unsuccessfully for the leadership three times, but claims senior Green Party figures \"collaborated\" to force him out of his post as policing spokesman for the party, due to his \"gender critical\" views.\nThe Green Party claim he was removed because he had become a \"divisive force\" in the party.\nA spokesperson for the party declined to give a figure on how much the court case is expected to cost. But the court documents say the party has said it will take every action available to recover the legal costs it has and will continue to incur from Dr Ali.\nThe BBC understands several other Green Party activists who hold similar views are planning legal action against the party off the back of Dr Ali's case.\nThe UK's political parties are in full fund raising mode, with a general election expected as early as next spring.\nThe Green Party made big gains at this year's local elections and has ambitions to double or even treble its current tally of one MP at Westminster.\nBut it has told members it needs the resources to match its ambitions. \nAccording to its latest accounts the party was left with cash shortfall last year, having spent £80,000 more than the £3.15m it raised.\nAs the party has increased its income - up from £366,000 in 2007 - it has steadily taken on debt, currently holding more liabilities than assets.\nMajor parties having no savings and \"spending more than they generate\" in any one year is \"actually very common\" according to party finance expert Prof Justin Fisher, Director of Policy Unit at Brunel University.\nThere is a risk, however, the party will progress in a diminished form, creating a vicious circle of a lower-profile leading to less income.\nLess income means the party \"would be less likely they could put up as many candidates,\" Dr Fisher said.\nAll general election candidates require a deposit of £500, which they get back if they win more than 5% of the total votes in the constituency.\nThe Green Party of England and Wales has strict rules around \"ethical business fundraising\" - refusing money from donors involved in polluting industries, the arms trade or pornography.\nThis means \"it is always a challenge to keep us going\" according to Baroness Jenny Jones, a Green Party peer in the House of Lords.\n\"We don't get money from big business or anywhere like that,\" she said.\n\"We've been offered a lot of money in the past and we've turned it down.\"\nOther parties have faced legal challenges in recent years, but the Greens do not have a large pool of institutional donors that other national parties can rely on.\nLabour is fighting a legal battle with former employees from the Corbyn-era, which the BBC understands could cost between £3m to around £4m. At the last election, Labour was able to raise £5.4m in donations - 25 times more than the Green Party managed.  \nA Green Party spokesperson said: \"Like many organisations, the Green Party is facing some challenging financial times, however it is wrong to suggest that the party has anything other than a very bright future and strong public support.\n\"We are confident that we will be in a better position than ever before as we go into the next general election. \n\"We have seen an increase in significant donations in recent months from people backing our work to get the next generation of Green MPs elected to build a fairer, greener future.\n\"We hugely value the work of our local parties and all our activists who are the face and voice of the Green Party in their communities and we continue to support them through our staff team and central party resources.\n\"On the case we are currently defending in court, we are confident of our position and will not be commenting further while proceedings are ongoing.\"\nCommenting on the legal case brought by Dr Ali, the party said it \"remains proud of its focus on equality and human rights for all and our support for the trans community\".\nGreen Party taken to court over gender-critical row\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Evergrande: The rise and fall of the property giant's billionaire founder", "date": "", "text": "Hui Ka Yan, the founder and chairman of Chinese property giant Evergrande, was once Asia's richest person. \nThe 64-year-old, who is also known as Xu Jiayin, rose from a humble upbringing to head a vast business empire. His fortune was estimated at $42.5bn (£34.8bn) when he topped the list of Asia's wealthiest people compiled by Forbes magazine in 2017.\nNow he is being investigated over suspected \"illegal crimes\" as his company teeters under the weight of $300bn (£245.4bn) of debt.\nBorn into a poor rural family in 1958, his early childhood was shaped by the Great Leap Forward - Mao Zedong's campaign to rapidly industrialise a Chinese economy reliant on agriculture that triggered a famine that killed millions. \nMr Hui was raised by his grandmother in a village in central Henan province after his mother died of sepsis when he was just eight months old.\nAfter graduating from university in 1982, he spent the next decade working as a steel technician before becoming a salesman for a property developer in the city of Guangzhou in southern China. It was there that he founded Evergrande in 1996.\nThe company expanded rapidly as China's economy boomed by borrowing large amounts of money.\n\"He was an example of how anybody can become rich if you're smart enough and if you work hard enough,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific at French investment bank Natixis.\nMr Hui, who has been a Communist Party member for more than three decades, was elected in 2008 as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The elite group of government officials and business leaders is the country's top advisory body. \nA photograph of him at a party conference wearing a gold-buckled belt made by the French luxury label Hermès went viral on social media in 2012, earning him the nickname \"belt brother\".\nA rapidly expanding Evergrande raised $9bn in its 2009 Hong Kong stock market listing.\nThat growth was then turbo-charged by Mr Hui's \"maximum leverage\" approach, according to Jackson Chan from financial markets research platform Bondsupermart.\n\"Evergrande grew fast but even faster after he [Mr Hui] made friends with a group of [the] richest real estate tycoons in Hong Kong and the company was listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange,\" Mr Chan says.\n\"He received numerous support from these friends as they bought a lot of Evergrande's stocks and bonds to help the company grow.\" \nEvergrande's business model was to borrow large sums and then aggressively sell apartments that had not even been built. The group's real estate unit currently has more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities in the country, according to its website.\nMr Hui's business empire grew to encompass far more than just property and now includes operations including wealth management, electric car making and food and drink manufacturing.\nIt also has a majority stake in what was once China's top football team, Guangzhou FC.\nIn 2020, Beijing brought in new rules to control the amount of money owed by big real estate developers.\nThe new measures led Evergrande to offer its properties at major discounts in an attempt to keep the business afloat. But it is now struggling to pay its debts.\nThe crisis has seen its stock market valuation shrink by 99% and Mr Hui's fortune plummet to $3.2bn.\nEvergrande suspended trading of its shares in Hong Kong as Mr Hui became the latest Chinese billionaire to find himself being investigated by authorities.\nSome experts see a link between China's wealthy elite coming under official scrutiny and President Xi Jinping's Common Prosperity policy, which aims to reduce income inequality.\nMr Hui is \"the symbol of extreme wealth especially with his flamboyant lifestyle, flying around the world in his private jet,\" Dexter Roberts, Director of China affairs at the Mansfield Center at the University of Montana, told the BBC.\n\"Xi has made it clear that extreme wealth, especially when displayed publicly like Hui, isn't good for the economy and the society,\" Mr Roberts said, adding that Mr Hui was \"seen as a natural target\".\nAlthough there has been no official statement yet on the investigation of Mr Hui, an opinion piece in the state-run Global Times newspaper indicated that the interests of ordinary citizens were being prioritised.\n\"Minimising homebuyers' losses at all costs should be the next biggest consideration in dealing with the Evergrande crisis,\" Hu Xijin, the paper's former chief editor wrote.\n\"We should deal with the matter strictly and in accordance with the law, keep the public informed, and look at how to support the company's customers as much as possible,\" he added.\nEvergrande chairman put under police surveillance\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Ask, Don't Assume: Disability Rights UK deletes ‘misjudged’ post on ads", "date": "", "text": "A leading charity has deleted a post that branded the government's latest disability campaign \"murderous\".\nDisability Rights UK (DRUK) said its initial response to the Ask, Don't Assume advertisements was \"inappropriate\" and \"misjudged\".\nThe campaign features disabled people wearing T-shirts with slogans on them, but it was criticised by some for being insensitive and intrusive.\nThe government said it worked with disabled people to create the campaign.\nThe adverts aim to highlight the need to check if someone wants assistance, and not to make assumptions about the capabilities of someone with a disability, and went public on Tuesday. \nThey feature three people wearing messages on their T-shirts, including a wheelchair-user wearing a top with \"don't push it\" printed on it, a woman holding a white cane with \"can't touch this\" and a woman with scarring on her arms with \"one of a kind\". \nBut the campaign has drawn criticism on social media since its launch, with some claiming it could open disabled people up to insensitive and intrusive questions about their disability. \nAnd in its now-deleted post on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday, DRUK wrote it did not \"support the government's ridiculous attempt to purple-wash their murderous ableist policies by using some disabled influencers to 'raise awareness' about disability\".\nPurple is the colour associated with disability, and ableism relates to discrimination that favours non-disabled people above disabled people.\nDan White, DRUK's policy and campaigns officer, told the BBC podcast, Access All the post had been removed due to \"inappropriate language\" and it \"should have been worded better\".\n\"It was a fast-moving, emotional response with, sadly, inappropriate language,\" he said.\n\"It was deleted because the language was misjudged and it could and should have been worded better.\"\nLISTEN: You can hear Disability Rights UK explain its thought behind its post, on the latest episode of Access All. \nHe added: \"We have to understand that we all get emotional in this community from time to time. We still need to speak truth to power, but there are better ways of doing that.\"\nMr White, whose daughter is disabled, said there were positives to draw from the campaign such as the inclusion of disabled people in creating it and the intention behind it.\nHe said the anger originated from the fact the government was focused on this rather than what he said were more serious inequality matters.\n\"Adults, children and carers cannot afford medication, can't afford fuel, can't afford food. Income isn't enough to keep people alive and we see this over the winter months, the excess deaths,\" he said.\n\"These are things that the government should be campaigning about.\"\nAmong those to voice their criticism of the Ask, Don't Assume campaign was TV presenter Sophie Morgan.\nMorgan posted: \"My thoughts on the new #AskDontAssume Campaign. Please, don't #ask. We will let you know if we need you for anything. Otherwise you can #assume we are just fine. Thanks.\" \nActivist Dr Amy Kavanagh, who is visually impaired, said she was disappointed by the lack of resources available to educate and inform people - calling the new campaign \"fluffy\". \nShe has been running a similar campaign for the past five years called Just Ask, Don't Grab, encouraging people to share their experiences online. \nShe posted that the campaign \"expects disabled people to be educators in the face of discrimination\". \nThe government's Equality Hub, which is behind the campaign, said it was \"committed to ensuring disabled people are treated with respect and dignity\". \nIt said in a statement: \"Ask, Don't Assume was developed in partnership with, and informed by, disabled people and their representative organisations from across the country.\"\nThe posters will be visible for the next 10 weeks, before the whole project is reviewed.\nYou can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the BBC Access All page.

{"title": "Aston Villa women to wear sweat-heavy shirts despite talks with manufacturer Castore", "date": "", "text": "\nLast updated on 29 September 202329 September 2023.From the section Aston Villa\nAston Villa's women's team are set to wear the club's sweat-heavy shirts for Sunday's Women's Super League opener against Manchester United.\nVilla's male players have criticised the shirts, saying they are uncomfortable because they are retaining too much sweat.\nBBC Sport understands Villa had hoped to resolve the issue by this weekend but that has not been possible, and talks with kit manufacturer Castore remain at a delicate stage.\nThe new claret and blue home shirts are the worst affected, noticeably changing colour in games as they retain moisture and cling tightly to the chest.\nThe Telegraph reported Villa and Castore are discussing an early termination of their multi-year contract, although BBC Sport understands players will remain in a Castore kit for the rest of the season, with the club seeking to change the material, not the shirt design.\nVilla manager Carla Ward said her players have \"similar concerns\" about the shirts as the men's team, but remain focused on Sunday's game, which is live on BBC Two and kicks off at 12:30 BST.\nWard said: \"I think it was highlighted early in our pre-season from the men's side and backed up by the women's.\"\n\"As far as I'm concerned it's for the club and Castore to deal with,\" Ward added. \"My focus has to be the weekend.\"\nEarlier this week football commentator Jacqui Oatley said Villa's women's side were \"dreading\" wearing the \"clingy\" shirts.\n\"They've got four TV games coming up,\" said Oatley. \"Normally they'd absolutely relish those games and look forward to them. But they're actually dreading it because they're really conscious about how they're going to look in this wet, clingy kit for obvious reasons.\"\nCastore have not commented to BBC Sport but told The Daily Telegraphexternal-link: \"There has been some media speculation about a potential issue in the football kit supplied by Castore to Aston Villa Football Club. \n\"We are working closely in collaboration with the club to address this issue as quickly as possible to meet the standards we expect. We would like to thank the club for their patience and support to date.\n\"As a proud new British brand, we always hold ourselves to the highest of standards and strive to do everything we can to constantly improve the performance of our products. This means addressing any customer concerns with promptness and humility.\"\nCastore, founded by Wirral-born brothers Tom and Phil Beahon, also provide sportswear for Andy Murray, other football clubs including Newcastle United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Rangers, as well as the Red Bull and McLaren Formula 1 teams.\nNewcastle issued a statement praising the company's products following a newspaper report suggesting the club was unhappy with the quality of them.\n\"The club has found the quality of Castore products to be extremely high,\" said the Tyneside club.\n\"We are proud to be wearing Castore's well-designed, innovative training and match kits in the Premier League, Champions League and FA Women's National League, and are appreciative of Castore's support and contribution to the club's trajectory over the last three seasons.\"\nWard said: \"My focus is making sure the players are focused on the weekend and the one thing I will say is the club have been absolutely superb in these last few days with constant communication with 'how can we help the players, what's going to help them, what will make them feel better?'. \n\"There's a genuine care from the football club. The players feel that, we feel that, but our focus solely now is on Manchester United.\"\nRob Warner is a former head of kit design at Umbro and Puma and is bemused at how the situation with Villa's kit has reached the current situation.\n\"I don't know if you really can explain it,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.  \n\"It's a difficult one because normally there would be so many checks and balances in place to make sure everything is appropriate for elite athletes, that you just wouldn't even countenance the idea of this happening on the field of play - especially at Premier League level. \n\"In terms of a route forward for the club, it's hard to really say. I would expect that the brand will be looking to get some shirts manufactured with different material, maybe a different factory all together but obviously, there's a long turnaround time on that. \n\"I think most Villa fans recognised this was an issue in pre-season but that was out in the United States where it was really hot, whereas now, if [Castore] have left it this late to try and rectify the issue, then they are potentially looking at six to eight weeks before anything major can really be implemented.\"\nJohn Devlin, an author on the history of football kits, says Villa are not alone in the issues they are encountering.\n\"Funnily enough, this has happened over in Germany with Bayern Munich and their Adidas kits,\" he said.\n\"They have had a couple of instances, one fairly recently, where they've struggled with the sweat wicking-properties of the shirt, but generally it has happened at international matches, especially in World Cups where they are dealing with extreme temperatures. \n\"It's incredibly rare to happen in the British game.\" \nRuth Wilson and Daryl McCormack star in a gothic detective story set in Ireland\nAs the allies unearth the horrors of the Holocaust, the hunt begins for the highest-ranking Nazis\nFollow Scotland’s only professional basketball team as they set out to break their trophy drought\nEmilia Fox forensically re-examines the unsolved case with Britain's top criminologist\nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

He didn't like being challenged on things.\n\"He didn't move with the times. I tried to explain some issues in what you can say and what you can't say and it just fell on deaf ears.\"\nThistle Marine - which provides services to the oil and fishing industries - was founded by Mr Clark in the late 1970s.\nThe tribunal in Aberdeen heard that Mr Clark accused Ms Farquharson of \"strolling in\" when it suited her and had a \"pet hate\" of people not turning up.\n\"Mr Jim Clark was blunt by nature. He would speak his mind. Mr Clark would often refer to employees who were off sick as 'snowflakes',\" it heard.\nIn August 2021, Ms Farquharson told her employers that she had the menopause and was experiencing a number of \"serious symptoms\".  \nThe company paid for her to have a private assessment of her condition.\nAs well as bleeding she was suffering from anxiety, a loss of concentration and brain fog.\nIn December 2022, Ms Farquharson worked from home for two days, at first because of heavy snow and then because she was unwell due to \"heavy menopausal bleeding\".\nThe next day she went in, arriving at 14:00 and passed Mr Clark in the corridor. The hearing was told that he spoke to her in a sarcastic tone, saying \"Oh, I see you've made it in\".\nShe mentioned the snow and also her heavy menopausal bleeding.\nThe tribunal heard that Mr Clark gave her a \"disgusted look\" and then walked away.\nMs Farquharson was upset and angry at the implication that she did not have good reason to have not been at work.\nShe later confronted him about the issues. The tribunal heard that he dismissed her menopause symptoms saying everybody has \"aches and pains\".\nMs Farquharson - a mother of two girls aged 19 and 21 - said she was \"shocked\" by his outburst.\nShe then wrote to the company launching a grievance about the \"disdain and disgust\" that she had faced.\nSeveral days later she discovered her remote access to the company accounts system had been cut off meaning she could no longer work from home.\nShe resigned and took Thistle Marine to the tribunal.\nAt the hearing Mr Clark dismissed his remarks as \"innocent\" and suggested Ms Farquharson had engineered her resignation to get money ahead of her marriage.\nThistle Marine's lawyers said her evidence could not be relied upon and suggested it was \"contradictory and unsatisfactory\". \nThey disagreed with the words Ms Farquharson attributed to Mr Clark and said he had no intention to harass her.\nBut, upholding her claims, the panel chaired by judge James Hendry said: \"Jim Clark can best be described a blunt, self-made man and successful businessman.\n\"He no doubt has many admirable qualities but empathy for others is not among them. \n\"It became clear to us that he has little time or respect for those, unlike himself, who are not able to work as hard or without illness as he has.\"\nHis remarks to Ms Farquharson violated her dignity, the panel concluded.\nMs Farquharson, who now works in accounts at another firm, said her treatment and the tribunal was a \"huge strain\".\nShe said: \"The stress was unbelievable and I know that I have gone through it and I have won, but I have still got this anxiety and disbelief at what they did.\n\"I have lost my self belief, I've got zero confidence now and I am very untrusting.

{"title": "Lizzo asks judge to dismiss dancers' harassment allegations", "date": "", "text": "Lizzo has lodged her first legal response to the lawsuit brought by three of her former dancers.\nIn August they claimed they had been subjected to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment while on tour with the US singer, which she denies.\nThe star and her Big Grrrl Big Touring company are requesting that the court dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be refiled. \nIf they do not, the dancers are requesting a jury trial.\nArianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez accused Lizzo - real name Melissa Jefferson - and her touring company of several allegations in the original complaint filed in a Los Angeles court.\nThese include claims that Lizzo pressured them to attend a sex show in Amsterdam and interact with the nude performers, and that dance team captain Shirlene Quigley repeatedly engaged in behaviour that made them feel uncomfortable.\nThey also accuse Lizzo of fat shaming, saying the Brit Award and Grammy-winner \"called attention\" to a dancer's weight gain following a performance; and that employees of the touring company singled out black dancers by accusing them of \"being lazy, unprofessional and having bad attitudes\". \nIt is also claimed that Lizzo denied dancers bathroom breaks during an \"excruciating re-audition\".\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Crystal Williams, Arianna Davis and Noelle Rodriguez say Lizzo \"needs to be held accountable\"\nIn the immediate aftermath of the claims, Lizzo took to social media allegations to say they were as \"unbelievable as they sound and too outrageous to not be addressed.\"\nShe added that \"sensationalised stories\" were \"coming from former employees who have already publicly admitted they were told their behaviour on tour was inappropriate and unprofessional\", something the dancers deny.\nLizzo's dance team Big Grrrls later released a statement in support of the singer, saying they \"had the time of our lives\" on tour.\nNow, in a 31-point rebuttal, lodged on Wednesday, Lizzo's legal team said:\nLizzo's spokesperson, Stefan Friedman, said in a statement that this was \"the first step\" of a legal process in which the star and her team \"will demonstrate that they have always practised what they've preached - whether it comes to promoting body positivity, leading a safe and supportive workplace or protecting individuals from any kind of harassment.\"\nHe continued: \"Any and all claims to the contrary are ridiculous, and we look forward to proving so in a court of law.\"\nIn response, the dancers' lawyer, Neama Rahmani said Lizzo's team's answer \"merely consists of boilerplate objections that have nothing to do with the case\".\n\"That said, the key takeaway is that Lizzo is agreeing to our clients' demand for a jury trial,\" he added.\n\"We look forward to presenting our case in court and letting a panel of her peers decide who is telling the truth, Lizzo and her team, who continue to shame the victims or the plaintiffs and so many others who have come forward sharing similar stories of abuse and harassment.\"\nEarlier this month, Lizzo was sued for the second time this year by a former employee who claimed she oversaw an \"unsafe, sexually charged workplace culture\".\nFashion designer Asha Daniels accused the star's wardrobe manager of making \"racist and fatphobic\" comments and mocking black women in the entourage.\nLizzo was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but was not directly accused of harassment.\nA spokesperson for the star called the case an \"absurd publicity stunt\".\nLizzo sued again over bullying and harassment\nLawyers review further allegations against Lizzo\nLizzo says dancers' harassment claims are 'false'\nLizzo dancer claims others are scared to speak\nLizzo accused of sexual harassment and fat-shaming\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Nottingham University Hospitals Trust failed to send 400,000 letters", "date": "", "text": "An NHS hospital trust in Nottingham failed to send more than 400,000 digital letters and documents to GPs and patients, BBC News can reveal. \nA former employee has told of \"a lack of responsibility\" over a new computer system.\nPatient body Healthwatch said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the scale of the incident and the impact on care.\nThe trust says a full investigation took place in 2017 and found no significant harm to patients.\nBut it has now said it will carry out a review of that investigation and take any further action needed.\nThe healthcare regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it was not aware of the incident and would be following up with the trust.\nThis is the second major incident in England involving unsent NHS letters uncovered by the BBC this week.\nThe events in Nottingham are on a bigger scale to those reported in Newcastle involving 24,000 letters.\nThe issue in Nottingham dates as far back as 2000, but the majority of unsent letters started to pile up from 2008, with up to 45,000 documents a year unsent by 2014.\nAgain, the BBC has been told the problems occurred when letters requiring sign-off were placed into a folder few staff knew existed.\nIn Nottingham, a \"Level 2 Serious Incident\" took place in 2017, and involved letters and medical documents that were effectively hidden within the hospital's computer system and not sent out to GPs as they should have been.\nA former employee at the City University Hospital in Nottingham, Emily Reason, confirmed the incident. \nShe said she came across some recently written but unsent digital GP letters awaiting authorisation in September 2017.\nMs Reason then carried out that authorisation, but by doing so she had unwittingly also authorised over 1,300 old letters and documents.  \nThis came to light when one GP contacted the trust. They had just received six letters about their patients, dating from 2013.\nThe incident triggered an inquiry at the trust the same year.\nThat investigation revealed that 411,000 letters and crucial medical documents which senior doctors believed had been sent out to GPs and added to patient records, had not been given a final authorisation - so they were sitting on computer systems, and no-one was aware. \nMs Reason told BBC News how staff struggled with using a new \"paperless\" system for typing letters, called Medical Office.\n\"Not authorising the letters was everybody's and nobody's fault,\" she said. \n\"Because there was a lack of training. There was a lack of responsibility or lack of expectations of responsibility.\"\nWhen it was clear there was a problem, Ms Reason said it was minimised as much as possible and hidden. \n\"It was assumed almost immediately that the risk to patients would be low, but the reputational risk was high,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I thought it would be all right now because the hospital would just handle it.\"\nEmily said she decided to speak out after seeing the recent BBC story about similar letter-sending errors at hospitals in Newcastle.\nShe believed those issues could have been avoided, had the problems at Nottingham been made public to warn other trusts.\nHealthwatch, the body which collects patients' experiences of health and social care, said it was \"deeply concerned\" to learn about the Nottingham incident.\n\"Whilst we know that sharing patient information has always been a significant challenge for different parts of the system, we cannot understand how this has happened on such a huge scale,\" said Jane Laughton, CEO of the Nottingham and Nottinghamshire branch.\nShe said there was particular concern over the impact of missing treatment plans and prescriptions for those with the most complex care needs.\nDr Peter Holden, a member of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"You would think in this age of computers that the transmission of information between hospital and general practice would be easy - it isn't.\"\nHe said primary care staff spend hours every day - time which should be devoted to patient care - chasing up discharge letters from hospitals as well as outpatient appointments.\n\"It's this kind of nonsense in the 21st century that is slowing up the practice of medicine because doctors are no longer administratively supported in the way they should be,\" he said.\nAnthony May, chief executive at Nottingham University Hospitals, confirmed an issue was identified in 2017 relating to the Medical Office system, which included letters to GPs amongst other documents.  \n\"As a result, a serious incident was declared and a full investigation was undertaken to establish actions in line with the Trust's governance processes at the time,\" he said. \nDocuments which posed a high risk were then reviewed and acted upon - about 23,000 files, according to the trust.\n\"GPs were informed, and we worked alongside representatives from primary care to agree which correspondence should be resent, which was completed.\" Mr May said \n\"No significant patient harm has been identified following the incident.\"\nThe Medical Office system is still in use at the Nottingham trust but bosses say they have improved training to stop the issue from happening again.\nA spokesperson for NHS England said hospital communication systems were \"managed locally\" and it was \"essential\" that all local NHS organisations ensure their processes for sending correspondence to patients and GPs are operating as they should be.\nA Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said officials would work with NHS England \"to establish the facts and take any necessary action\" so patients across the country receive the highest standard of care.\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

{"title": "Steve Bunce column: We won't see elite fighters like Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez again in boxing", "date": "", "text": "\nLast updated on 4 hours ago4 hours ago.From the section Boxing\nSaul 'Canelo' Alvarez has got to be the oldest 33-year-old in boxing history.\nOn Saturday, in his 64th professional fight, Canelo will face a fellow undisputed champion in Jermell Charlo.\nHe belongs in a different era, a different time. We won't see elite fighters like Canelo again.\nWe won't see world champions having their 64th fight unless they're coming out of retirement in a crossover fight in 2037 somewhere.\nBut I'm not so sure I subscribe to the idea Canelo's powers are fading. I saw him up close and personal against John Ryder in May and he looked as sharp, as strong, as powerful as ever.\nHowever, just the pure mechanics of it tells you that has to be the case - eventually. You can't have all those fights and not fade.\nYou can't have 20 fights before your 18th birthday, you can't turn pro at 15, you can't have 23 world-title fights in 12 years, you can't fight as many as 20 excellent fighters throughout your career, and have all those hard rounds and it not take a toll.\nCanelo's only human after all. I mean, he's at the far end of normal as a human, more super-human.\nBut human still. I'm assuming he'll become an old man in one fight. But we've not seen that yet and I don't think we saw that against Dmitry Bivol last year.\nPeople want to jump on that and say that's Canelo finished. But Bivol is a lot smarter and a lot better than people give him credit for.\nThe WBA light-heavyweight champion is too good to lose to a man as small as Canelo, no matter how easy it seems to be for Canelo to produce magic.\nBivol didn't fall for his tricks. He stuck to the job and he did what he had to do. He wasn't spectacular, but he was brilliant in his timing, his confidence and his feet.\nThat night, we didn't see an old-man Canelo, we just saw a really good light-heavyweight beating a man who is nowhere near a light-heavyweight.\nSo I don't see that as a sign of Canelo's decline; however, it's inevitable.\nPerhaps we have been spoiled by the brilliance of Canelo. This fight against Charlo is a good fight and Charlo is good enough to warrant being in this fight.\nBut maybe we are spoiled that we want more. We're used to super-fights when it comes to Canelo.\nHe moved to Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) from Matchroom Boxing earlier this year and we can only assume it was for money.\n'Iron Man' Charlo, however, is a great fighter. He should be a much bigger star than he is.\nFamously, few photographs exist of the mercurial and mysterious boss of PBC, Al Haymon. I've never seen him and I've been to countless fights of his down the years.\nI know people who have met him and never heard a bad word about him. But he doesn't do interviews.\nNot like some of the British promoters.\nSo perhaps in that sense Haymon likes his fighters to be a bit like him, very wealthy and mildly anonymous.\nCharlo is one half of a set of twins. He and his brother Jermall are both world champions.\nJermell is fast and slick. He's actually two months older than Canelo, which is bizarre.\nHe's by no means the new kid on the block. He turned pro when he was 17 years old, just two years after 15-year-old Canelo did.\nHe's lost just one fight in 37 bouts, and had a draw against Brian Castano which he corrected immediately. That fight in May 2022 made him the undisputed champion at light-middleweight.\nI think Charlo has beaten enough good men and been in hard enough fights to warrant getting this fight.\nTo be 17 making your debut as a pro and going on to achieve what he has, that's a rare club.\nThere's an incredible storyline to this fight. One kid was 15 and one kid was 17 making their pro debuts, both boy fighters, and here they are meeting.\nExactly 100 fights between them, both with massive winning records. That's a great story. We won't have this kind of thing again.\nCharlo might be slightly older, but he's a lot fresher. I've got this feeling he's going to really deliver.\nSure he's going up in weight, but I always thought he was a big light-middleweight.\nCanelo is going to be naturally bigger and stronger and weight will be an issue, but I don't think it will be the issue.\nI think we're going to see the best of Charlo in Las Vegas. If he does have an Achilles heel, Canelo, it's guys who are smart. Smart guys can give him headaches.\nI'd liked to have seen Callum Smith with two arms fight him. Not saying he would have won had he not injured his bicep, but it would have been a much better fight.\nI think Charlo will rise to the occasion. That's why I'm very heavily considering the possibility that there will be screaming at the end assuming it goes the 12, and I fancy the 12.\nIt's not an easy fight for Canelo. I'd be stunned if people aren't screaming at the end with their interpretation.\nHe's had an awful lot of those, Canelo has, when you look back on it. Where people look at a fight and think he may have lost it, or it was close, or it was so close he could have lost it if he dropped one more round.\nI can see this being the same.\nFind out how to get into boxing with our special guide.\nRuth Wilson and Daryl McCormack star in a gothic detective story set in Ireland\nAs the allies unearth the horrors of the Holocaust, the hunt begins for the highest-ranking Nazis\nFollow Scotland’s only professional basketball team as they set out to break their trophy drought\nEmilia Fox forensically re-examines the unsolved case with Britain's top criminologist\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Sumotherhood star Jazzie Zonzolo for this weekend's Premier League games.\n \n \n \n "}

The US players were paid to play in the Presidents Cup - a Ryder Cup equivalent against a rest of the world team. \nCantlay was also the only US player to not wear a cap in their team photos.\nBoth he and his friend and Saturday morning playing partner Xander Schauffele also missed the US team's pre-Ryder Cup visit to the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club earlier in September.\nThere was no questioning their commitment on the course though, as they fought back from three down after eight holes, winning three holes in succession from the 12th, to draw level. \nHowever, Tyrrell Hatton, who holed winning putts on the sixth and eighth holes, rolled in another on 16 to put Europe back in front and he and Jon Rahm won it on the next when Schauffele missed from four feet after the Spaniard nearly holed his tee shot.\nAnd there was no questioning what a record defeat meant to Scheffler either as the Texan broke down as he was driven away on a buggy.\nA pushed drive on the first led to a double-bogey six and he and five-time major winner Koepka combined to bogey and double bogey the next two to hand Europe an advantage they would not relinquish.\nIndeed they took full advantage with Sweden's Aberg, who only turned professional in June, hitting a pin-seeker of a tee shot that set up a win on the fourth. And the pair shared five more birdies in the next six holes to complete an extraordinary victory.\nMuch was written about captain Luke Donald's perceived gamble in giving Aberg a wildcard pick. But the 23-year-old has repaid the faith shown in him with two points from two matches with Hovland and Europe may well have found another successful partnership.\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood continued their fine Ryder Cup week by beating Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas 2&1 in a match that the Northern Irishman felt they played better in \"than getting pushed to 17\".\nSpeaking to BBC Sport Northern Ireland, he added: \"I have been waiting for this opportunity for two years.\n\"Whistling Straits was a disappointment and I wanted to put it right and redeem myself a little bit. \n\"I have been able to do that over the first day and a half and now I have the opportunity to try and go unbeaten for the week.\"I'm in a position where I can see the finish line. We want to win both sessions today. That is our goal.\"\nMcIlroy, who is back out with Matt Fitzpatrick for the afternoon foursomes against Cantlay and Wyndham Clark, will, along with Hovland, be the only Europeans to play in all five sessions.\nHovland has 2½ points from three matches so far and he will again partner Aberg as they take on Sam Burns and Collin Morikawa in the top match. \nFleetwood is out with Nicolai Hojgaard against Homa and Harman, while Justin Rose and Bob MacIntyre take on Spieth and Thomas.\nAnalysis and opinion from the BBC's golf correspondent.\nGet the latest golf headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.\nFrom hitting a few balls on the range or a quick nine holes, to the full 18 and tournaments - how to get into golf.\nRuth Wilson and Daryl McCormack star in a gothic detective story set in Ireland\nAs the allies unearth the horrors of the Holocaust, the hunt begins for the highest-ranking Nazis\nFollow Scotland’s only professional basketball team as they set out to break their trophy drought\nEmilia Fox forensically re-examines the unsolved case with Britain's top criminologist\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Sumotherhood star Jazzie Zonzolo for this weekend's Premier League games.\n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "WSL 2023-24: Everything you need to know about the new Women's Super League season", "date": "", "text": "\nLast updated on 1 minute ago1 minute ago.From the section Women's Football\nAfter a four-month hiatus, the Women's Super League returns on Sunday and it looks set to be the biggest season yet following the record-breaking Women's World Cup.\nA jam-packed opening day will feature all the teams in action, with last season's surprise package Aston Villa hosting runners-up Manchester United in the curtain raiser, which will be live on the BBC.\nChampions Chelsea face London rivals Tottenham at Stamford Bridge in the evening fixture, while title challengers Arsenal could set a new WSL crowd record when they host Liverpool at Emirates Stadium.\nSo who are the favourites this time around? Will the battle for Champions League qualification be the most competitive yet? And how can you follow this season's action? Here's everything you need to know about the 2023-24 WSL season.\nBoth the title and relegation race last season went down to the final game, while Arsenal only pipped Manchester City to third and the final Champions League spot on goal difference.\nBut if the WSL managers are to be believed, this campaign could be even closer.\n\"I expect it to be the most competitive WSL season that has ever been,\" said Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall. \"I think a lot of squads have been strengthening.\"\nIt's hard to look further than Chelsea for the title. Emma Hayes' side are bidding to finish top for the fifth year in a row, having won seven of the past nine WSL titles and having strengthened their squad over the summer.\n\"She's going for the quadruple - one million per cent,\" former Chelsea player Gilly Flaherty told the BBC's Football Daily podcast. \"Of course the Champions League is the one thing that has eluded Emma, has eluded Chelsea. \n\"Chelsea's squad is one that any player in it could walk into any other WSL side and start.\"\nHowever, of the established top-four members, only Manchester United are still in the Champions League along with Chelsea, which could give Arsenal and Manchester City an advantage with fewer games to negotiate. \nAston Villa, who proved to be the best of the rest last season, showed they were more than capable of holding their own against the big teams with league wins over City and Arsenal and they have recruited wisely once again.  \n\"Success for me looks like continuing what we have been building,\" said Villa manager Carla Ward. \"Now does that mean top four? No, it means trying to better what we did last year and continue to try to close the gap.\n\"Looking at the WSL and looking at how everyone's recruited and the investment that has gone in up and down the division, I have no doubt this is going to be one of the toughest WSLs yet so we needed to recruit, we needed to keep building.\"\nWhile the other major leagues in Europe are up and running, managers, players and fans have had to wait until October for England's top flight to return. \nThe start comes days after an international break for the start of the Women's Nations League, and just six weeks after the World Cup final.\nLeicester manager Willie Kirk expressed his irritation at having preparations for the opening day disrupted by international games. \"It's a pain in the backside - I hate the international window,\" he said.\n\"I was a little bit frustrated we didn't start before the Nations League. I think every major league in Europe did apart from us. I don't know why we are any different.\"\nVilla's Ward shares that frustration with international breaks, but did not want the league to start earlier as she feels too much is being asked of players.\n\"You'll probably not find anyone that moans more about international breaks more than me. If we're talking about player welfare, we have to do something.   \n\"We forget that they're people and we have to start looking after them physically, mentally, emotionally.\"\nBut former England striker Ellen White believes that having lots of tired players could result in a more interesting league.\n\"There is going to be a lot of tiredness, a lot of fatigue,\" she said. \"It's going to come into it maybe that first month or two - hopefully the results will be a bit crazy! That's what I want.\" \nAll the WSL clubs, except Leicester, broke a club or stadium attendance record last season and several may do so again this time round.\nArsenal have sold more than 50,000 tickets for Sunday's opener at Emirates Stadium against Liverpool, which could break the WSL attendance record they set last season - last September they sold 53,737 tickets for their match against Tottenham which translated into an attendance of 47,367.\nIn 2022-23, only West Ham did not play at their club's bigger stadium, usually reserved for their men's side, and teams are once again looking to stage more of their matches at their larger grounds.\nArsenal have confirmed at least five of their 11 WSL home games will be at their 60,000-plus capacity Emirates Stadium, compared with three last season. It will be one of three grounds usually used by the men's teams to feature on the opening weekend, along with Stamford Bridge and Villa Park.\nNewly promoted Bristol City are no strangers to the top flight but a lot has changed for them since their relegation in 2021.\nThe club have switched home ground twice and moved to a new training facility, and changed head coach and appointed a much bigger backroom staff, as well as overhauling the playing squad.\n\"What we have done as a club is really professionalise how we are run, so our staffing has really increased since being relegated,\" said head coach Lauren Smith. \"The game is moving so quickly so we have got to keep up.\"\nWhile there will be plenty of faced new to the WSL on the pitch, including World Cup stars Hinata Miyazawa, Amanda Ilestedt, Daphne van Domselaar and Geyse, there have also been a couple of changes in the dugouts.\nRehanne Skinner, sacked by Tottenham in March, has replaced Paul Konchesky as West Ham manager.\nMeanwhile Spurs, involved in a relegation battle last campaign, have gone for a manager new to the league in Swede Robert Vilahamn.\n\"Of course we want to be a top team in this league but the main thing is to start playing the kind of football that can take us up there,\" said Vilahamn.\nThe BBC will show one fixture per week - 22 games in total - while Sky will broadcast two matches per weekend and the FA Player will stream the rest of the games.\nIn addition, the BBC Sport website and app will have live text commentary on every match, along with weekend previews, reports and the latest news.\nYou can also watch highlights on the Women's Football Show - the WSL version of Match of the Day - which is broadcast on Sunday nights on BBC One."}
{"title": "Energy price cap: What is it and will bills continue to go down?", "date": "", "text": "Millions will see their energy bills fall from 1 October, after a drop in the price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for each unit of gas and electricity they use.\nA typical dual-fuel household will pay £1,923 a year between October and December - down from £2,074 in the previous period.\nIn recent years, the cost of variable tariff energy deals in England, Wales and Scotland has been controlled by the energy price cap, which is now set every three months by Ofgem, the energy regulator. \nThe cap confirms the maximum price suppliers can charge households per unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff in normal circumstances. It covers 29 million households. \nEnergy prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so in October ministers said household bills would be limited by a temporary government guarantee instead. \nUnder this, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill stayed below £2,500 despite Ofgem's cap increasing above this level. \nThe Energy Price Guarantee finished in June 2023, and the Ofgem cap once again determines how much customers can be charged. \nFrom 1 October, typical bills will be £1,923, which is £151 less than the previous cap and £577 down on last winter.\nEnergy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland, where bills are slightly lower.\nThe calculations for a typical household are based on a direct debit customer using 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year. \nA kilowatt hour is a unit of energy used to calculate your bill. \nHowever, most households aren't typical. \nBills are based on how much energy you actually use, which depends on the number of people, the type of property and its energy efficiency.\nIn July 2023, Ofgem said \"around 4 million\" households had prepayment meters.\nIt reviewed their use after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.\nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain households. \nThe government has promised to bring prepayment energy charges in line with those for direct debit customers, but this has not yet happened. \nBetween October and December, the typical bill for prepayment households will be £1,949, down from £2,077, but still £26 more than for direct debit customers.\nTypical bills for those who pay via cash, cheque or bank transfer, usually every three months, will be £129 more. \nIt is is impossible to tell for certain, not least because wholesale energy prices are affected by global issues, such as the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts that prices will rise again in January 2024. \nIt estimates that typical annual bills will rise to £1,996. \nThe consultancy does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade.\nLower prices should restart competition in the market, as suppliers start to offer fixed deals to customers, which set gas and electricity prices for a certain period of time. \nUnlike variable tariffs, these are unaffected by the cap.\nConsumer groups and regulators say this could be good for consumers, but warn that such deals do not suit all circumstances.\nIf variable deals continue to fall in price, anyone already locked into a fixed deal would miss out on those savings. \nThose considering signing up for a fixed deal should also pay close attention to standing charges and exit fees, rather than just the headline rate.\nSome groups across the UK who may struggle to pay bills are receiving additional help through cost-of-living payments:\nVulnerable families can also claim help through the Household Support Fund, and - from October 2023 - the Warm Home Discount scheme. \nImportantly, the £400 discount which all households in England, Wales and Scotland received last winter has finished. \nUntil the end of March 2023, businesses had their costs limited under the government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme. \nUnder a new scheme running until March 2024, firms get a discount on wholesale prices, rather than costs being capped. \nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, will get a larger discount than others.\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Five ways to save money on your packed lunch", "date": "", "text": "Usually it's cheaper to make lunch at home instead of buying food out and about. But over the last year, staple lunchtime ingredients have gone up in price at the supermarket.\nWe've gathered some top tips on how to keep costs down when making a packed lunch for work, school or a day trip.\nCaroline Job launched blog and YouTube channel Lunchbox World when coming up with different ideas for her three kids' packed lunches. She enters an identical list of items into different supermarkets' online shopping apps to see which one comes up cheapest, and looks for discount codes.\nAlthough it might take a bit of extra time, Caroline says it has made a big difference as she has noticed the prices going up for different products like cucumbers or eggs.\nIf you buy your food from town centre convenience stores they might charge more - so you could save money by going to a large supermarket to stock up.\nYou could also consider swapping your favourite branded snacks for own-label versions.\nCaroline also suggests taking a look at what is in the cupboards, fridge or freezer before doing the food shop to make sure you're not doubling up.\n\"Have a plan as to what meals you're going to prep and what you might want to eat that week for your lunch,\" she says.\nShe adds that one \"game changer\" for her was working with best before dates to ensure that food was not being wasted.\n\"I now rejig my menu for the week as it progresses - if the ham is going off, then I'll use that up today and have a chicken sandwich tomorrow.\"\nRitesh, a father of two from Hounslow, adds that prepping different items has helped him manage a squeezed budget.\n\"Our kids love rice pancakes, so we will often prep the mixture the night before and we'll have them for breakfast and combine them with something different for lunch,\" he says.\nIt can be frustrating when a lunchbox comes back from school at the end of the day completely untouched.\nBut the freezer can be a big help when it comes to getting a greater variety of food on the menu for the week.\nThe NHS Better Health website recommends keeping a small selection of different types of bread in the freezer like bagels, pittas and wraps, granary or multigrain. If you pop a piece of greaseproof paper in between each, it's easier to get just one out when it's frozen, Caroline suggests.\nAnd if you're looking for a snack option, frozen fruit is typically cheaper than fresh, especially out of season.\nFrozen fruits count towards your five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. There is less waste and you can choose the exact amount you want to use.\nWith food prices rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, Dr Charlotte Evans - an associate professor at the University of Leeds, specialising in nutritional epidemiology and public health - is concerned the nutritional value of packed lunches might decline as budgets are squeezed.\nShe argues: \"Replacing homemade items with the cheapest, pre-packed snacks like crisps or chocolate biscuits might be the first place people look to make savings.\"\nAlthough it can be tempting to reach for something that saves on time, pre-prepared options can often be a lot more expensive at the shops and less nutritious.\nDr Evans suggests making up your own a Japanese-inspired, compartmentalised bento box to use up leftover items in the fridge or cupboard.\n\"It's a great way to use up lots of little bits - a wrap, some lettuce or carrots, a little bit of bean chilli from the night before.\"\nThe British Nutrition Foundation suggests putting a small handful of mixed dried fruits or nuts into reusable food bags or sealed containers to store in the cupboard to make your own easy snack.\nAnd if you have some spare time, growing your own cress for your egg sandwiches could also be a fun project for the family - as well as cheaper than buying it from the supermarket.\nBatch-cooking is a great way to save on money and time in the long-run, says personal finance expert Rachel Wait.\nShe says that pasta dishes are easy to make in bulk, along with stews with beans, soups or muffins. \nYou could just make a little extra for your evening meal and use the leftovers the day after for your lunchbox.\n\"Cooking with pulses like beans and lentils can be a cheaper alternative to meat and can also help bulk out meals,\" she points out.\nDr Evans adds that adding extra salad items like lettuce or cucumber to a sandwich could help bring costs down too.\n\"It can make a sandwich look much more appetising - different textures, colours... It makes it look like a proper sandwich and bulking up on the veg means you're using perhaps a little bit less of the expensive stuff like cheese and ham.\"\nFive hacks to help save money on your food shop\nPret hikes price of drinks subscription to £30\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Food prices: How can I save money on my grocery shop?", "date": "", "text": "As price rises bite into budgets, many people are cutting back on the weekly food shop.\nAs well as buying less, people are looking for ways to make their money go further and to make the most of what they have. The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.\nRosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. \"We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,\" she says. \n\"There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard.\" \nShe keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around £40.\nLynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced section. \"If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,\" she says.\nShe suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.\n\"Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,\" she says. \"If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings.\"\nAccording to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around £700 every year by throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on waste.\n\"If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,\" she says. \"You'll also be able to buy things cheaper in supermarkets that are close to their sell-by date. Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them.\"\nMore on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website.\nKate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.\n\"You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,\" she explains. \"But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money.\"\nRosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. \"How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,\" she explains. \nShe puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.\nHelen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. \n\"Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,\" she says. \nKeeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5°C. \"We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,\" she says. \"This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature.\"\nRosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience. \n\"Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,\" she says. \"If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got £8 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cuts.\n\"They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further.\"\nWe asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: \nMy wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland\nI highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of \"what's for dinner\"? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey\nTip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes\n I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted!

{"title": "How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work", "date": "", "text": "If you're on the hunt for a job and not sure where to start, or how to pitch yourself you're not alone.\nThe rising cost of living has meant thousands of businesses have been laying off staff, with many people finding themselves out of work. \nUnemployment is close to its lowest rate since the 1970s. But there are about 8.65 million people out of work. \nIt may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.\nThere have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. \nYvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says \"Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. \n\"Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,\" she says.\n\"Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role.\"\nMs Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.\n\"For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. \n\"So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. \n\"Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same.\"\nNot all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. \nMany businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. \nMiranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: \"Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.\n\"They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help.\"\nLots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. \nBut now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. \nOther platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. \nYvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.\n\"Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application.\" \nIt can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. \nMiranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: \"Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for.\"\nIt's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. \nOur career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. \nCareer influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. \nShe's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. \n\"Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact. Celebrating these wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated\".\nSix tips for getting a job if you're over 50\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Energy saving tips: Five ways to cut costs this winter", "date": "", "text": "The new energy price cap has set the amount suppliers can charge customers this coming winter.\nTypical bills have fallen back from last year's levels but there are other ways you may be able to reduce your costs. \nActual savings will vary for different households. \nMost of the energy we use at home goes on heating.\nTurning the thermostat down by just one degree could save about £150 annually. \nYou can also use your boiler's timer - if it has one - to ensure your heating switches off when the house is empty. \nWhile it might be tempting to reduce your heating to save money, the government recommends a room temperature of at least 18C. Older people and those who are ill or disabled may need it to be warmer. \nIf your house is too cold it could encourage damp - which can lead to mould. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma.\nHow this saving is worked out: Experts at Cambridge Architectural Research (CAR) found that turning the thermostat down from 19C to 18C would save 13% on an average annual gas bill - that was worth about £157 in winter 2022. CAR suggests 68% of homes could benefit. Its findings are based on estimated energy use in 12,300 homes questioned by the English Housing Survey in 2012. The Energy Saving Trust previously estimated a saving of £145 a year, if temperatures were reduced from 22C to 21C in main living areas.\nIf you have a combi boiler, try reducing the flow temperature for the water heating your home to 60C. This is the temperature of the water the boiler sends to the radiators.  \nA higher temperature will heat your home faster, but it could also mean bigger bills.\nCombi boilers tend to capture and recycle heat less efficiently at higher temperatures - meaning it requires more gas to heat your home.\nIf you have a conventional boiler, such as a system with a hot water tank, you could try setting it to 65C. It's important not to set it any lower as it could create a health risk - legionella bacteria could develop in the water.\nIf you want to consider adjusting the flow temperature, the Energy Saving Trust has more information and the Nesta charity has a guide to walk you through the process.\nIf you rent your home you might want to check with your landlord before making changes. \nHow this saving is  worked out: CAR modelled the potential savings from reducing the temperature of combi boilers from 75C to 60C, in 2022. It found this would save 8% on an average annual gas bill - about £97 in winter 2022. CAR suggests 38% of homes in the UK could save money with this measure. \nThere are a couple of ways to save money when you shower.\nFirstly, cutting the length of your shower from about seven minutes to four could save about £84 a year. \nSecondly, you could consider buying a water-efficient showerhead - available from about £10. (Check they are compatible with your shower first).\nThese work by restricting the amount of water coming through the head. This means you use less hot water for the same length of shower. This could mean a saving of about £98 a year even if you don't have shorter showers.\nHow this saving is worked out: CAR assumed that each household took two showers a day, that an average shower lasted seven minutes, used eight litres a minute and had a temperature of 41C. It says four-minute showers would save an average of 24 litres of hot water, resulting in an energy saving of 1.1 kWh per shower, or around 800 kWh per year for a household. CAR also estimated that a low-flow shower head would save an average of 28 litres of hot water, resulting an energy saving of 1.3 kWh per shower, or around 950 kWh per year for a household. \nRadiators in many homes have valves which control the temperature in each room. \nIf used correctly, these thermostatic radiator valves - often numbered one to five (sometimes up to six) - can save you money.\nIn rooms you use less often, consider turning the valve to the midway point (this should still heat the room to 18-20C). \nKeeping doors closed will also help trap heat.\nHow is the saving worked out: CAR's study found that homes with radiator valves are likely to have partially adjusted them so that rooms outside the main living area are already 1.5°C cooler. However, reducing the temperature by a further 1.5°C could save 5.5% of the total gas bill (a saving of £68 in winter 2022). Its modelling found that 76% of UK homes could save with this measure.\nPoorly insulated homes lose heat more easily and are harder to keep warm.\nDraught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy.\nTo stop cold air getting in and heat escaping, consider:\nBut do not block extractor fans, wall vents and airbricks. These are necessary for ventilating certain rooms (like your kitchen and bathroom).\nThe cost depends on which areas you want to draught-proof and how you want to do it. A professional draught-proofing service could save more energy. The Energy Saving Trust has further advice. \nHow this saving is worked out: The saving is based on a typical three-bed gas heated, semi-detached house using a gas price of 10.3p/kWh and electricity price of 34.0p/kWh. The Energy Saving Trust's figures are based on the government's methodology for energy modelling in homes. \nNote: All savings figures are based on a typical gas-heated home in Great Britain with an annual usage of around 12,000 kWh of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity, using a gas price of 10.3p/kWh and electricity price of 34.0p/kWh (based on Energy Price Guarantee October 2022).\nCombining all measures could potentially save a typical household £530 per year, according to Nesta/CAR/Energy Saving Trust calculations. Due to the potential for double counting, this is less than the £625 total of adding up each individual measure in this article. There are dangers in overly severe energy rationing - underheated and damp homes come with health risks.\nThese tips have been chosen in collaboration with UK broadcasters - including the BBC, ITV, Sky, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - as well as Citizens Advice, the Climate Change Committee, Energy Saving Trust and Nesta. \nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Energy bills: What can I do if I can't afford to pay?", "date": "", "text": "Annual energy bills are falling in October, but prices remain much higher than in recent years.\nSome of those struggling to pay have been forced onto more expensive prepayment meters, prompting energy regulator Ofgem to strengthen rules to protect consumers. \nThe government launched its Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022. It replaced the previous Ofgem energy price cap, and limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500. \nThis remained in place until the end of June 2023, when the Ofgem cap was reinstated, at which point a typical annual energy bill fell to £2,074.\nUnder the latest price cap, typical annual bills will fall to around £1,923 between October and December.\nIf you don't agree a payment plan with your supplier, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed, or they may switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nIn very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection, but you'll normally be offered a meter first.\nIf you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:\nSuppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.\nMany suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.\nPaying by direct debit is normally the cheapest way to pay for electricity and gas. Cancelling a direct debit means future bills are likely to be higher.\nNon-payment could also damage your credit rating, and make it harder to borrow money. \nThe regulator Ofgem reviewed the use of prepayment meters after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. \nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\". \nIn addition meters cannot be fitted for:\nThose forced onto a prepayment meter will get £30 initial credit to reduce the risk of them losing supply.\nThe government has said prepayment energy charges will be cut, bringing them in line with direct debit rates.\nSuppliers have also been told to identify households where meters were wrongfully installed, return the customer to their previous tariff and offer compensation. \nCheck your direct debit\nYour monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year, and your supplier may reduce your bill if its estimate is higher than the amount you actually use.\nYou can also request a flexible monthly direct debit where you only pay for your actual consumption. This requires a smart meter or regular readings.\nHowever, two-thirds of gas usage is during the winter months, so make sure you understand the impact of reducing payments during warmer weather. \nPay what you can\nIf the direct debit is fair, but you can't meet it, ask your supplier for an \"able to pay plan\" based on what you can afford. \nBy paying something every month - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears grow more slowly, and your supplier may be less worried about your debt. \nYou may be able to get your name added to the Priority Services Register (PSR), a list of households entitled to extra support. \nThose eligible include pensioners, pregnant women, parents of young children, and people who are disabled. \nOfgem also recommends asking your supplier to add your name to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on your energy supply for medical reasons.\nIf you have different gas and electricity suppliers, you need to contact them both.\nBeing on the PSR doesn't cancel your arrears. But it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. \nClaim any relevant benefits\nThe independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide to available benefits, while Policy in Practice and the charities Entitledto and Turn2us run benefits calculators.\nYou may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through the government's Fuel Direct scheme.\nA number of suppliers and charities also offer hardship grants. \nCheck you're getting extra government help\nThere is a range of government support to help with energy bills, available to households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on certain disability benefits.\nThe next payments for some eligible groups will be made between 31 October and 19 November.\nAdjust your boiler\nIf you have a combi boiler at home - you don't have a hot water cylinder and there is a (usually white) plastic pipe under the boiler - you may wish to consider turning down the heating flow temperature. \nOn the front - sometimes behind a flap - look for a dial or set of buttons with a radiator icon. Turn the dial to the number three, or the 12 o'clock position. If it has a digital display, select 60C. \nYou may also want to turn off the hot water pre-heat. Many boilers come on every few hours - night and day - to ensure there's always some hot water available. \nMost homes don't need this, and turning it off saves money. \nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is GDP and how is it measured?", "date": "", "text": "GDP - or Gross Domestic Product - is an important tool for judging how well, or badly, an economy is doing. \nIt helps businesses decide when to expand and hire more people, and lets the government work out how much it can afford to tax and spend.\nGDP is a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in a country.\nIn the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more significant.\nWhen an economy is growing, each quarterly GDP figure is slightly bigger in than the previous three-month period. \nMost economists, politicians and businesses like to see a steadily rising GDP because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.\nWhen GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which is bad news for businesses and workers. \nIf GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can lead pay freezes and lost jobs. \nThe Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.\nAlthough higher prices have squeezed consumers' budgets more recently, the UK has avoided going into recession.\nAccording to the official statistics for the most recent quarter, the economy grew by 0.2% between April and June. That was slightly higher than predicted. \nHowever, the monthly figure for July suggests the economy actually shrank by 0.5%, which is worse than expected. \nThe Office of National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was driven by strike action by NHS workers and teachers, plus wet weather which hit construction and retailers.\nIn January 2023, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out a pledge to \"grow the economy\". This will be met if GDP is bigger in the three-month period between October and December 2023 than it was during the previous quarter (July-September).\nThe government can use growing GDP as evidence that it is doing a good job of managing the economy. Likewise, if GDP falls, opposition politicians say the government is running it badly.\nBut it's more than just a report card on the government's economic performance. \nIf GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals.\nGovernments also like to keep an eye on how much they are borrowing in relation to the size of the economy. \nFor example borrowing was equivalent to about 14% of GDP in the first year of the Covid pandemic, the highest proportion since World War Two.\nGDP can be measured in three ways:\nIn the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. \nBut early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. \nThe UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.\nAt that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in.\nThe ONS publishes more information about this on its website.\nGDP doesn't tell the whole story:\nJust because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that an individual person's standard of living is improving. \nIf a country's population increases, it pushes GDP up, because with more people, more money will be spent. \nBut individuals within that country might not be getting richer. They may be getting poorer on average, even while GDP goes up.\nThe ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. \nSome critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable, or the environmental damage it might do. \nAlternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. \nIn 2010, the ONS started measuring well-being alongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. \nIn 2019, then New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern released the country's first \"well-being budget\", prioritising health and life-satisfaction rather than economic growth. \nBut despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is the UK inflation rate and why is it so high?", "date": "", "text": "The rate at which prices are rising slid to 6.7% in the year to August, down from 6.8% in July.\nSlowing food inflation on items like milk, cheese and eggs helped drive the surprise fall, although the pace of food price rises remains high - at 13.6%.\nTo help slow inflation, the Bank of England has increased interest rates 14 times to 5.25% since November 2021. \nInflation is the increase in the price of something over time. \nIf a bottle of milk costs £1 but £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) tracks the prices of hundreds of everyday items in an imaginary \"basket of goods\".\nThe basket is constantly updated to reflect shopping trends, with the most recent changes adding frozen berries and removing alcopops.\nEach month's inflation figure shows how much these prices have risen since the same date last year. \nYou can calculate inflation in various ways, but the main \"headline\" measure is the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).  \nThe CPI rate was 6.7% in the year to August, down from 6.8% in July.\n\"Core inflation\" excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco.\nThis measure was 6.2% in August, down from 6.9% in June and July, which was the highest level since 1992.\nThe Bank of England considers this number as well as CPI when deciding whether to change interest rates. \nSoaring food and energy bills helped drive inflation up. \nOil and gas were in greater demand after Covid. The war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.\nThe conflict also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. \nThis effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.\nAlcohol prices in restaurants and pubs had also risen. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThe Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is still well above that. \nThe traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. \nThis makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. \nWhen people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.\nBusinesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. \nIn August, the Bank increased interest rates for the 14th time in a row, taking the main rate to 5.25%. \nIt had been widely expected to raise rates again in September but instead decided to hold them at 5.25%. \nOfficial figures showed that - on average - regular pay excluding bonuses grew by 7.8% between May and July, compared to the same period a year earlier. \nThis nearly matched the rate of inflation in the same period, which meant real wage growth was almost flat for the first time in two years, after falling behind. \nHowever, unions point out that many workers have received smaller pay increases, and there have been widespread strikes over pay. \nThe government has argued that big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. \nLower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they rise less quickly.\nThe Bank of England has predicted inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.\nBank governor Andrew Bailey said it was \"crucial that we see the job through\" and get price rises back to the 2% target, because people \"should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value\".\nBut he admitted that price inflation has been \"more sticky than previously expected\".\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.\nIn January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. \nOther countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.\nMany of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials, and the fallout from Covid.\nThe annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 5.3% in the 12 months to July, stable compared to June and down from 6.1% in May.\nThe European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. On 14 September, it raised its key interest rate - the benchmark deposit rate - to 4%, a record high.\nIn the US, inflation was 3.7% in the year to August, up from 3.2% in July and 3% in June. \nAt its September meeting, the US central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged between 5.25%-5.5% as it considers whether it has done enough to stabilise prices.\nAugust saw the 11th increase in rates by the Federal Reserve since early 2022, with rates at their highest for almost two decades.\nIt warned further raises would follow \"if appropriate\". \nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nHow much are prices rising for you?

{"title": "Debt: What should I pay first and what can I do?", "date": "", "text": "Another tough winter faces many people who have been struggling with the cost of living and may be seeing their debt demands rise.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates financial services, says that 11 million adults in the UK struggle to pay their bills - a rise of 3.1 million compared with last year.\nSo what can you do if you find yourself in difficulty?\nConsumer advice charity Citizens Advice says that you should work out how much you owe, who to, and how much you need to pay each month.\nIdentify your most urgent financial demands. There are what are known as priority debts and bills because there can be serious consequences if you do not pay them, such as losing your home or facing court proceedings. They should be paid first.\nThey include rent, mortgage repayments, and loans secured on the home, gas and electricity bills, child support and maintenance payments, council tax, income tax, VAT and other taxes, TV licence payments, court fines and payments.\nCalculate how much you can cover in debt repayments. Create a budget by adding up your essential living costs like food and housing, and take these away from any income such as your wage or benefits you receive.\nAfter than move on to looking at other debts, although failure to pay could still lead to the arrival of bailiffs. These are credit cards, store cards, buy-now-pay-later payments, overdrafts, unsecured loans and water bills. Ignoring them would still see the cost of those debts spiral.\nAlways see how you could boost your income, primarily by checking what benefits you are entitled to, and whether you are eligible for a council tax reduction or a lower tariff on your broadband or TV package.\nIt is important that you do talk about financial difficulties before finding yourself in a spiral of debt. The earlier, the better.\nIf you think you cannot pay your debts or are finding dealing with them overwhelming, seek support straight away. You are not alone and there is help available. A trained debt adviser can talk you through the options available.\nInformation and support is available and free of charge - click here to find out about organisations who may be able to help.\nYour supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan first.\nIf you don't agree a plan with your supplier, it has been the case that they might try to force you to have a prepayment meter installed, or they may switch your existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nBut since it emerged that meters were being forcibly fitted into the homes of vulnerable people, companies are now required to pass certain tests before they can switch customers.\nA \"breathing space\" scheme in England and Wales shields people in problem debt from further interest and charges.\nPeople receiving debt advice can apply for the break, which lasts for up to 60 days, to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\nPeople receiving mental health crisis treatment can apply for a scheme which lasts for the length of that treatment, plus another 30 days.\nConsultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium.\nFor some people, there is little or no chance of paying off debts, and so they may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\nThis should only be done after seeking advice. There are different forms of insolvency which may be considered depending on your circumstances and where you live.\nBankruptcy: This is the most serious option, which involves an official receiver being appointed to sell off your assets to pay your debts. If you own a house or a car you may lose them. \nThe bankruptcy will affect your credit record for at least six years. But after one year all your debts will be written off. The procedure currently costs £680, but you can pay in instalments. \nIndividual Voluntary Arrangement: Under an IVA, an insolvency practitioner will help you strike a deal with your creditors, which allows you to pay off your debts over a fixed period - say five years. Once approved, all interest on unsecured debt is frozen. \nThere is less stigma with an IVA, and a greater chance of you keeping your home if you own one.\nDebt Relief Order: This form of insolvency, introduced in 2009, is the easiest of all. Your debts must not exceed £30,000. If your application is accepted, some debts will be frozen for one year, then written off. A DRO costs £90.\nInsolvency in Scotland: If you live in Scotland, bankruptcy is known legally as sequestration. However there are three alternatives: a Debt Arrangement Scheme, a Debt Management Plan, or a Trust Deed.\nEleven million Britons struggling to pay bills\nWhat can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?\nWhat is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?\nMillions have less than £100 saved as prices soar\nPeople in problem debt get 60-day break scheme\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "How to save money even when the budget is tight", "date": "", "text": "Saving money may feel like a pipe dream when bills and the cost of essentials, such as food, are rising fast.\nBut financial experts say it is crucial to put some money aside for emergencies.\nAnd the interest being paid on some savings accounts now is better than anything seen for 15 years, so it will pay to spend some time putting your money in the correct place.\nThe benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of England has been rising consistently for nearly two years, and may now have peaked. The cost of living has also been going up, with prices rising at a rate still well above target.\nThat means two things for any money we have set aside. \nFirstly, the returns (or interest) being offered on savings accounts has improved, although borrowing is more expensive. For example, you may find an account paying 5% a year, so £1,000 saved for a year will earn £50 in interest. Save for lots of years, and that lump sum keeps building under what is known as compound interest.\nSecondly, the buying power of the money we do have saved is being diluted by rising prices.\nBank of England figures show that there is £268bn in non-interest paying accounts - which are primarily current accounts. \nExperts say that finding a good savings account for that money will help people benefit from those higher rates, and counter some of the downsides of rising prices.\nInvesting the money is another option, although that carries greater risks.\nHigh energy and food bills mean that, for many people, their money doesn't last until the end of the month. Finding anything to set aside is difficult.\nIf you have debts that need bringing under control, then that is widely considered to be the priority, ahead of any savings decisions.\nHowever, putting some money aside regularly into an emergency savings fund can help avoid serious debt. If your car breaks down, or the children's school shoes need replacing, then it is better to have money available than to borrow it.\nYou also might want to save throughout the year for Christmas or holidays.\nThe general advice is to spend some time going through your finances, then set a savings goal, and to start with saving a small, manageable amount on a regular basis.\nThe Building Societies Association, which runs UK Savings Week, has a guide about how to get started.\nThis is where it can get quite complicated. There are a wide range of savings products available, and your personal circumstances will determine which is best for you.\nThe most basic savings product is an easy-access account. They tend not to have the best interest rates, but you can withdraw your money whenever you like.\nSome accounts such as fixed-term accounts or bonds pay more in interest but your money is locked in for a certain period of time.\nAnyone starting out might consider regular saver accounts, some of which are sold alongside current accounts. Again you might not be able to access the money for a certain period of time and, by starting small, it may take time before any meaningful interest is built up.\nAlso, there are notice accounts, which require you to tell the provider in advance when you plan to withdraw money. Alternatively, you can forgo interest and instead enter a prize draw, such as with Premium Bonds.\nIf you don't have access to a bank account, then credit unions offer the opportunity to save. Savings scheme incentives provided by the government may encourage longer-term savings. particularly for children.\nThere are plenty more and, with such a variety, it is best to shop around. That shouldn't only be for the best interest rate but, perhaps more crucially, to find the account that best suits your needs.\nAnna Bowes, founder of the independent Savings Champion website, says some savers can suffer from \"choice paralysis\", so it might be best to set yourself a deadline when making a decision.\nHelpfully, every account now displays a summary box outlining its key features, which makes it a bit less time-consuming to compare between them.\nDefinitely not. Banks, building societies and other savings providers often advertise eye-catching headline interest rates. Sometimes those deals are only available for a few weeks. \nThe best interest rate may only last on a product for a year, after which it may revert to a much lower rate. So, being loyal may be more convenient, but won't necessarily pay the most. That is why it is best to review old accounts you may have set up years ago.\nIn fact, banks have come under heavy pressure from MPs and regulators to ensure that rates - particularly on easy-access accounts - reflect the wider market and are not just used to make excess profits.\nEvery basic and higher-rate taxpayer has a personal savings allowance, which means you don't pay tax on the first £1,000 of interest you earn from savings (or the first £500 if you're a higher-rate taxpayer).\nIndividual Savings Accounts, known as Isas, allow you to save up to £20,000 a year, and the interest is tax-free.\nLarge amounts held in savings can affect a claim for universal credit.\nIf a bank or building society goes bust, then the first £85,000 per person, per institution is safe and would be refunded.\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is the state pension and the triple lock?\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Interest rates: How the Bank of England's decision affects you and your money", "date": "", "text": "The Bank of England has held interest rates, ending a run of 14 consecutive increases.\nIn September, the Bank rate, set by the Monetary Policy Committee, was unchanged from the previous month at 5.25%.\nThat may bring some relief to homeowners who have seen mortgage rates rise and potentially the end of better news for savers.\nThe Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 15 years.  \nThe theory is that raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money, meaning people have less to spend, reducing demand and inflation.\nRates had risen 14 times in a row since December 2021 as the Bank tries to bring inflation closer to its target of 2%.\nPrices rose by 6.7% in the year to August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was lower than the 6.8% in the year to July, and down from the peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\nAlthough that is still more than three times the Bank's 2% target, it has influenced the decision to pause the run of Bank rate rises. That decision was split, with five of the nine-member committee voting for a pause. \nPolicymakers will be keeping a close eye on the \"core inflation\" rate - a measure which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy. It was down from 6.9% in July to 6.2% in August.\nThe chances of rates actually starting to fall again look slim at the moment.\nAndrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: \"I can tell you that we have not had any discussion... about reducing rates, because that would be very, very premature. Our job is to get inflation down.\"\nAt one point, UK rates were expected to rise above 6%, but that peak is now expected to be lower, even if there is a rise at a later date. \nThe Bank has to balance the risk of damaging the economy, which has shown little sign of growth, with the need to slow price rises.\nIts Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide rates.\nMortgages\nJust under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey.\nWhen interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. \nDespite the pause in rises, compared with December 2021, those on a tracker mortgage are still paying £540 more a month, and those on an SVR are paying £299 more a month.\nAround three-quarters of mortgage customers hold fixed-rate deals. Lenders may now have some confidence to lower mortgage rates, although they are still much higher than much of the last 10 years.\nComparatively high interest rates mean house buyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a year or more ago. \nAs people roll off cheap fixed-rate deals onto products with much higher rates, monthly repayments can soar by hundreds of pounds. Banking trade body UK Finance says there are about 800,000 fixed rate deals ending in the second half of 2023, and about 1.6 million deals expiring next year.\nThe IFS, a politically independent think tank, warns rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable income fall by more than 20%.\nYou can see how your mortgage may be affected by using our calculator:\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nCredit cards and loans\nBank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. \nThe latest Bank statistics show that in July, the average annual interest rate was 21.7% on bank overdrafts and 20.76% on credit cards. The average rate for personal loans was 8.61%, up slightly on the previous month. \nLenders could decide to put prices up, if they expect higher interest rates in the future.\nSavings\nIndividual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rate rises to customers. \nThere are some good deals on the market already, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as many will be on accounts paying little or nothing. \nThe UK's financial watchdog has warned that banks will face \"robust action\" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers.\nAlthough many savings accounts are paying more, even the best interest rates aren't keeping up with inflation. \nThis means the value of cash savings - its buying power - is falling in real terms. \nInflation has been relatively high worldwide, after Covid restrictions eased and consumers spent more. \nMany firms experienced problems getting enough goods to sell. Oil and gas costs were also higher than they had been - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \nAlthough many elements of inflation are global, there are also domestic factors at play in the UK, including rising wages.\nInterest rates have been increasing across the world in recent months.\nThe UK has one of the highest rates in the G7 - a group of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.\nIt is higher than the Euro area and the US.\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nIs this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?\nWhy does the Bank of England change interest rates?\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cost-of-living payments: Who is getting them and when?", "date": "", "text": "Millions of people are receiving payments to help with higher bills, with more to come.\nLow-income households, pensioners and some disabled people are entitled to additional cost-of-living funds after the government extended a scheme it launched in 2022. \nA committee of MPs is currently investigating whether the payments are supporting those most in need.\nSome groups are receiving payments to help with higher bills, including:\nThe first instalment of £301 for those on means-tested benefits was received by about eight million people in late April and June. The next of £300 will be paid between 31 October and 19 November.\nThe payment, in three instalments, is available to households who receive the following benefits: \nThe payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their national insurance number, followed by DWP COL.\nThe 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits, are paid slightly later than others.\nPeople are not eligible for these payments if they receive the new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or the new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.\nAnyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, or report it here.\nTo qualify for the latest instalment, people had to have claimed a benefits payment between 18 August and 17 September, or received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated.\nAn estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments.\nOther eligibility details are outlined here. \nNone of these cost-of-living payments affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive.\nUp to six million people on the following disability benefits received another £150:\nThose payments were made between 20 June and 4 July.\nHouseholds that receive the winter fuel payment - which is worth £200-£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra £300 in November or December 2022, and will get another £300 this coming winter.\nLower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.\nTwo payments totalling £650 were made in 2022 to more than eight million low-income households. \nPayments of £300 were also paid to pensioners during last winter, and a £150 payment was also made to those with disabilities. \nSome people would have received all of those payments, if they were eligible.\nA £150 rebate, often through people's council tax bill, was made last year. The Household Support Fund, which is distributed by local councils, helped vulnerable people, including giving fuel vouchers to those in need.\nAll household energy bills were cut by at least £400 between October and March. \nThe discount was made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales. However, there are no plans to repeat this in the coming winter. \nSeparate arrangements were made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. \nThey received a single payment of £600 starting in January, which was more than in the rest of the UK because a higher proportion of households use heating oil. \nDirect debit customers in Northern Ireland had the money paid into their bank accounts. Other customers were sent a voucher. \nThe Commons Work and Pensions Committee is investigating whether cost-of-living payments have been received by those in most need of help.\nThey are studying whether some have missed out on hundreds of pounds because they are just outside the qualifying criteria, and whether the package as a whole is sufficient for low-income families.\nThe government launched an Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022, which limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500 throughout last winter.\nThe scheme, which applied to England, Wales and Scotland, is still in place if needed, but has not been required since July.\nThat's because a typical bill fell to around £2,074 a year under regulator Ofgem's energy price cap in the summer, and will fall further to £1,923 a year in October.\nA government scheme to cut energy bills for businesses finished at the end of March. \nUnder a new scheme that began in April, firms get a discount on wholesale prices rather than costs being capped as under the previous deal.\nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, get a larger discount than others.\nHow is the rising cost of living affecting you?

{"title": "Cost of living: Five tips when asking for a pay rise", "date": "", "text": "If you feel like you're not getting paid enough, you're probably not alone.\nWhile average wages have been increasing, they're still not keeping up with the pace of price rises, which means many people are finding it harder to get by.\nRecent months have seen waves of strikes, with tens of thousands of workers walking out in disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.\nMany of these strikes have taken place in the public sector, where workers often do not have the power to negotiate individually.\nAnd whether you work in the public or private sector, even if you do have a conversation with your manager there's no guarantee that it will result in a pay rise.\nHowever, there are ways to give yourself the best chance of success. \nWe spoke to recruiters, a manager and a workplace psychologist to get five tips on how to best negotiate for more money.\nJill Cotton, a career trends experts at jobs site Glassdoor, says scheduling a talk in advance will allow you and your boss time to prepare, and means you're more likely to have a productive conversation.\n\"Don't spring this on your line manager,\" Ms Cotton says. \"Be upfront and say that you want to book in a conversation that is specifically about pay.\"\nRowsonara Begum, who helps her brother run Saffron Indian takeaway in Salisbury, says it also needs to be the right time for the business.\nThe takeaway has five members of staff and occasionally takes on additional workers during busy periods.\nShe says if workers pick a time when the business is doing well, they will have the best chance of successfully negotiating more money.\nIf you're asking for a pay rise, you should have lots of evidence of why you deserve one.\n\"Know what you've achieved either from a work setting or what you've done to develop yourself, maybe to support your team, support your line managers. List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.\nThis evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.\n\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.\nHowever, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.\n\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"\nWhen asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.\nThat's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.\n\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.\n\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"\nOften people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".\nWomen and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.\nHer advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.\nMost experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.\nDo your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.\n\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.\nMs Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.\n\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.\nIf the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.\n\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.\nPay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.\n\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.\nAnd if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.\n\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.\nPay rises at fastest pace for over 20 years\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nStrike dates: Who is striking and what pay do they want?\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Renting: What are your rights as a tenant?", "date": "", "text": "Rents are rising at their fastest rate since records began in 2016.\nBut with a quarter of tenants struggling to pay, what are your rights?\nMost tenants have a rental agreement called an assured shorthold tenancy. \nSome of these are \"rolling\" - which means tenants pay rent weekly or monthly, with no fixed end date.\nIn England, the landlord:\nAny rent rise must be fair and realistic, in line with local properties.\nOther renters have a \"fixed\" agreement, which typically runs for six or 12 months.\nThe landlord:\nIf the fixed term is a year, landlords must give six months' notice.\nThere are some other tenancy agreements with different rules.\nThe housing charity Shelter's online tool can help people in England find out what kind of tenancy they have.\nHousing law and renting rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThis video can not be played\nWhat can you do about rent increases? Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute.\nIn England a holding deposit is paid to a landlord to reserve a property.\nIt can't be more than one week's rent.\nYou should get the money back within seven days of signing your tenancy agreement - or it can go towards your rent.\nBut if you decide not to move in, you could lose it. \nIf the landlord doesn't give it back, and you think they should, write to them.\nIf you still don't get a refund, contact one of the letting agent redress schemes.\nYou can also complain in England to Trading Standards through the Citizen's Advice consumer helpline.\nSuch deposits are not legal in Scotland, and rules are different in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords need to follow strict rules if they want a tenant to leave - if not, the eviction could be illegal, or the landlord could be guilty of harassment.\nIn England the landlord has to give written notice to the tenant, which could be: \nOther tenancy contracts have different rules.\nOnce the notice period ends, the landlord can start eviction proceedings through court.\nLandlords can apply for a so-called \"possession order\". If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a \"warrant for possession\".\nEviction rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nTenants in England have the right to \"live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair\". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs.\nHowever, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice.\nIf so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council.\nYour landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council. \nTenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.\nThere are no laws explicitly stopping this, but MPs are considering more protections for renters in England.\nUnder a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a \"well-behaved\" pet, which the landlord can only refuse on reasonable grounds - such as the size of the property.\nHowever, landlords will be able to charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.\nThe law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.\nAt present it could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.\nHowever, BBC News foundalmost a quarter of some 8,000 adverts examined on the property website OpenRent indicated that families were not eligible.\nMore than 300 listings on another property portal, Zoopla, explicitly said children were not wanted, although this was less than 1% of those we looked at.\nSome 73% of sampled OpenRent listings said tenants with pets were not welcome, compared with 6% on Zoopla. \nShelter warned the problem would be even more widespread as sometimes prospective tenants were only told they were not welcome when they applied. \nLandlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.\nIf a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge a tenant more than the amount they pay. \nExhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "First time home buyers: How much can I borrow?", "date": "", "text": "With rents rising, lots of people are crunching the numbers to see if they can afford to buy their own home.\nBut it is a big financial commitment, with risks if house prices fall or if you need to relocate. \nSo what do you need to know to help you decide?\nMost people spend less each month on their mortgage payments than they would on rent for a similar property, according to the Halifax. \nHalifax's most recent Owning vs Renting review found on average the monthly mortgage costs for a three-bed home were £42 lower than renting the equivalent.\nBut the difference varies widely across the UK.\nHomeowners in Scotland make big savings compared to renters. While in the east of England it is cheaper to rent than to own.\nFirst-time buyers can apply for the same mortgage deals as any other borrower. But banks and building societies will look very closely at a first-time buyer's financial situation and credit record. \nAfter a year of steadily rising interest rates, mortgage rates have also gone up, to between 4% and 7%.\nMortgage brokers like Riz Malik at R3Mortgages say that it can be hard for first-time buyers to borrow large amounts, as lenders are getting tougher over affordability criteria. \nTypically, a bank might lend you four or five times your salary.\nIt also depends on what outgoings you have. If you already owe money, such as a car loan, or have student debt, that will be taken into account.\nA lot of money advice websites have calculators to help you work out what you can afford and mortgage brokers can help you identify deals to suit your situation.\nThe average house price for a first-time buyer is just over £300,000.\nSaving a large enough deposit is the biggest hurdle for many would-be homeowners, one of the reasons the average age of a first-time buyer has risen to 32.\nUsually you need a deposit worth at least 10% of the property's value. But the bigger your deposit, the better deal you will get from the lender.\nThe average deposit for first-time buyers is £62,470 according to Halifax, almost double the UK's average annual salary, with people typically putting down around 20% of the purchase price of their property.\nSome lenders will accept a deposit of 5% of the property's value. Skipton Building Society is even offering a no-deposit mortgage. It is the first mortgage to cover 100% of the value of the property since the financial crisis and uses your history as a rent-payer to establish credit-worthiness.\nIf you are saving for a deposit and you are between 18 and 40, the government will match 25% of any money you save in a Lifetime ISA.\nMore than 60% of first-time buyers are opting for joint-ownership and that's not just couples. Increasingly friends are choosing to buy together too, says Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons Estate Agency.\nAny joint arrangement should be drawn up with a proper legal contract, as all parties will be liable for the full mortgage, says Ms Beveridge.\nA first-time buyer is someone who has never owned or part-owned a property before. That offers a tax advantage as long as you are buying a property to live in.\nIn England and Northern Ireland first-time buyers don't pay stamp duty - a tax based on the value of the property you're buying - on properties worth less than £425,000.\nScotland's equivalent, the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, is waived for first-time buyers of properties worth less than £175,000.\nThere is no first-time buyer relief for the Wales' Land Transaction Tax.\nThe biggest government scheme to support home-buyers, Help to Buy, has ended (except in Wales), although recently there have been reports the government is considering a reboot.\nThere are others including the First Homes scheme, aimed at helping first-time buyers and keyworkers with a household income under £80,000 (or £90,000 in London) to buy new-build properties.\nShared ownership schemes allow you to buy a share of the property and pay rent for the rest, with the option of increasing your stake when you can afford to.\nNeither of these schemes are on the scale of Help to Buy, says David Hollingworth at L&C Mortgages. Help to Buy helped ramp up house prices, he adds, making them less affordable for first-time buyers today.\nDeposit-free mortgage aimed at renters launched\nWhat are the new stamp duty rates?\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is happening to house prices?\nWhat are your rights when you're renting?\nUS on the brink of a government shutdown\nEx-gang leader charged with Tupac murder in 1996\nAlmost all ethnic Armenians flee Nagorno-Karabakh\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\nThe rise and fall of Evergrande's billionaire founder\nBBC reporter: My heart aches as I return to Sudan\nIndia's unforgettable highs and lows in World Cup cricket\n'We are devastated - it's so sad to see Sycamore Gap tree gone'\nDavid Olusoga: ‘The UK is less equal than 50 years ago’\nMae Muller: Eurovision broke my heart but album kept me going\nDemocrats, design and deer: Photos of the week\nCatastrophic floods devastate Greece's farmers\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.
