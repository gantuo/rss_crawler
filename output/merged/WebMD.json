{"title": "As Superfungi Spread, the CDC Raises Alarms", "date": "2023-09-13 23:46:06", "text": "\nThe hospital was doing everything it could. It set up a separate unit to house COVID-19 patients. It imposed exhaustive hygiene measures to keep the virus from spreading. It even used ultraviolet light for sanitization, which at that time – July 2020 – was being marketed with great enthusiasm as a way to zap COVID particles out of thin air.\nStill, patients at this Florida medical unit remained gravely ill. Ventilators, feeding tubes, catheters pumping medicines straight into patients’ hearts – none of it seemed to be enough.\nThe battle against the virus raged on.\nThat’s when a blood test came back with a peculiar result. Then another. Then another.\nCOVID, it turned out, wasn’t the only enemy. The patients were positive for a fungus: Candida auris, or C. auris for short. This wasn’t just any old yeast. C. auris—a “superfungus” associated with that scientists think may be linked climate change— is capable of can cause invasive, sometimes life-threatening infections, according to the CDC. Florida’s first reported case was in 2017, and since then, the organism has cropped up across the state. In the COVID unit that was set up in the summer of 2020, about some 35 patients tested positive for the fungus in just 2 weeks. Within 30 days, eight had died.\nToday, the threat of superfungi is still on the rise, and it’s hardly limited to the Sunshine State. As heat and drought ravage many parts of the country, drug-resistant fungi are spreading. Floods cause the deadly strains to mingle with more benign ones, enabling antimicrobial-resistant genes to jump between species. Hurricanes are pulling entombed fungi from beneath the earth, showering the air with potentially deadly mold.\nMeanwhile, the arsenal against superfungi is sparser than ever, as decades-old medicines aren’t as effective and new drug legislation is stalled in Congress. “We’re sort of where we were 30 years ago,” says John Rex, MD, chief medical officer at the drug company F2G and a former member of the FDA ’s Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee. “There remain very few options.”\nBy the standards of nature, C. auris is a baby. It was first identified at the Teikyo University Institute of Medical Mycology, after doctors in a Tokyo hospital had a hard time treating a 70-year-old woman whose symptoms suggested a basic ear infection. What researchers found was anything but basic: small, pill-shaped cells that indicated a distinct species. Their case study was published in 2009, but C. auris wasn’t discovered in the United States until 2016.\nA baby, perhaps, but far from harmless. Almost 20% of patients in the first series of U.S. cases died within 30 days of getting the fungus. The number doubled within 3 months.\nIt’s essential not to confuse C. auris with its less virulent cousins like C. albicans, which is easily treatable, notes Tina Tan, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Lurie Children’s Hospital and vice president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “You really have to be vigilant,” Tan says, “and understand what you're dealing with.”\nNow C. auris is at the top of the CDC’s most-wanted list. Earlier this year, the agency called the fungus an “urgent” threat “because it is often resistant to multiple antifungal drugs, spreads easily in healthcare facilities, and can cause severe infections with high death rates.” A paper based on CDC data noted a “dramatic increase” in the spread of the fungus, with 17 states reporting their first-ever cases between 2019 and 2021. Since then, 18 more states have seen first cases of their own.\nThe outbreaks “demonstrate how easily something can spread,” says Meghan Lyman, MD, medical officer in the CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch.\nC. auris is distinctive in ways that make controlling outbreaks a tall task, she says. The fungus is hardy: It can survive for weeks on surfaces ranging from toilets to telephones. It’s tenacious: Products like Purell, Lysol, and Virex may not keep it from spreading. It’s evasive: Traditional biochemical tests often misdiagnose it or fail to detect it at all. And it’s a shape-shifter, appearing sometimes as lines, other times as ovals; sometimes in isolation, other times in clusters.\nGiven how easily it spreads, health professionals face a tough challenge. Jeffrey Rybak, PharmD, PhD, a pharmacist and antifungal resistance researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, has received calls from a colleague across the country seeking advice on how to quell the outbreak. “You have to have concern for the patient in front of you–and equal concern for the other patients in the facility,” he says. Often, Rybak says, “you’re fighting a losing battle from the infectious control standpoint.”\nC. auris didn’t come out of nowhere. Researchers say it’s here because of climate change, which makes it one of the first infectious diseases–some say thefirst–directly linked to the climate crisis.\nA group from Johns Hopkins, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the Netherlands cites several reasons: warmer environments that are about the same temperature as the human body, droughts that lead to saltier wetlands akin to the bloodstream, and intense ultraviolet light exposure that fosters mutations. Although the authors concede that global warming is “unlikely to explain the whole story,” they say the emergence of C. auris “stokes worries that humanity may face new diseases from fungal adaptation to hotter climates.”\nIt’s telling that states severely affected by climate change report the most cases of C. auris. Nevada, for example, has had prolonged heat waves in recent years, as well as an intense drought that threatens the Colorado River Basin, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Not coincidentally, the state has seen an extraordinary number of C. auris patients relative to its population–more than 1,600, according to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services. As of July 2023, about 140 of them had died.\nMark Pandori, PhD, director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, has been tracking the outbreaks since the beginning. He notes that there are only three types of antifungal drugs, and since superfungi may be resistant to one or more of them, treatment alternatives are limited. Adding to the problem, these options are often toxic. One of the drugs is amphotericin, which can cause reversible kidney injury.\nGiven how hard it is to identify C. auris in the first place, cases have likely been underreported, according to Pandori. With uncertain data, doctors don’t always know when and how to intervene. “It’s like any other challenge, military or otherwise,” he says. “You don’t have information, you can’t act.”\nOf course, C. auris isn’t the only medical challenge linked to global warming. Consider, for example, the 2010 case of a boy in Washington state who went to the pediatrician complaining of chest pain. At first, doctors didn’t see a need to hospitalize him, but that changed when, within 3 days, he began to have trouble breathing. Tests later showed that his lungs contained coccidioides, the bug that causes valley fever, a fungus usually found about 1,000 miles to the south. It was Washington’s first documented case. A case report notes “climate changes conducive to colonization, allowing expansion into new regions.”\nIn other words, climate change isn’t just giving rise to new superfungi; it’s also allowing old fungi to flourish. “Small temperature changes for fungi cause them to adapt, or go away, and for other organisms to move in,” says Tom Chiller, MD, chief of the CDC’s Mycotic Diseases Branch.\nSince coccidioides first appeared in Washington, fungi once limited to certain regions have been found far from their original homes. Valley fever is more common well outside the Southwest valleys for which it is named. Histoplasmosis, triggered by a fungus usually found in Ohio, is now in Michigan and Minnesota. Blastomycosis, normally linked to caves in the Southeast, has turned up in states as far-flung as Texas and Vermont.\nFor most people, common fungal infections– thrush, athlete’s foot, diaper rash– are easily treatable with wipes, drops, or ointments. These conditions can be more serious for more vulnerable patients like newborns, the elderly, and the estimated 9 million Americans with compromised immune systems.\nAnd as old fungi spread to new regions, some become more deadly. Case in point: Aspergillus fumigatus. Hospitalizations from this ubiquitous mold have jumped 40% in recent years. It now tops the CDC’s Watch List of resistant organisms that can “spread across borders and cause significant morbidity and mortality,” but whose “full burden … is not yet understood.”\nThat has been Tan’s experience in Chicago, too. In the past decade, she’s seen more severe cases of blastomycosis. Where once kids came in just with lung disease, they now have fungal abscesses in their bones and skin. In hotter, more humid conditions, Tan says, fungi tend to be “driven into overdrive.”\nTo curb the spread and combat antimicrobial resistance, policymakers and industry leaders worldwide have stepped up.\nOn the one hand, they’re naming the issue. In 2013, U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, founded the Valley Fever Task Force, which set out to help develop new antifungal medicines through the FDA. But progress has been sluggish. Almost a decade after the task force was established, McCarthy continued to emphasize “the critical need to find effective treatments.”\nOn the other hand, they’re proposing legislation. In 2021, McCarthy introduced the Finding Orphan-disease Remedies With Antifungal Research and Development (FORWARD) Act, with the hope that the National Institutes of Health would target coccidioidomycosis, among other fungal infections, and the FDA would make development of antifungal drugs a priority. But the FORWARD Act remained stuck in the House. In 2022, Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-CA, reintroduced a pared-down version as part of a larger law. That bill, with further refinements, was passed in the House in June 2022 and adopted by Congress in December 2022.\nDon’t count on a breakthrough right away. The bill gave the FDA almost 5 years to enact guidance that would lead to new drugs. No such guidance had been issued as of August 2023, according to Beth Fritsch, an FDA external affairs officer.\nMoney is being poured into drug development. For example, there’s the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Action Fund, a joint investment involving the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, the World Health Organization, the European Investment Bank, and Wellcome Trust. But antifungals aren’t a top priority. The fund hasn’t yet targeted yeast like C. auris or molds like aspergillus.\nWithout that support, developing antifungals will be held back, according to Rex at F2G. The relative rarity of cases tends to make clinical trials complicated and expensive, and with the path to faster FDA review stalled in Congress, the approval process can take years. For drugmakers, the financial incentive is less than compelling, Rex says, noting that they “are still more interested in cancer or Alzheimer’s.”\nOptions keep growing slimmer as superfungi swarm. Rex likens the problem to infrastructure maintenance: Tending to sewage lines rarely tops anyone’s list of priorities– until there’s a catastrophe. “It’s important to take care of your pipes, but it’s not fun,” he says. “Paying for preparedness is not fun.”\nTo raise awareness, the CDC’s Lyman is hitting the road, educating as many doctors as she can and calling for a sense of urgency. “There are a lot of places where it just doesn’t seem to be a problem for them,” Lyman says.\n“Until it’s a problem for them,” she adds.\nPHOTO CREDIT:\nScience Photo Library/Getty Images.\nSOURCES:\nTom Chiller, MD, chief, Mycotic Diseases Branch, CDC.\nMeghan Lyman, MD, medical officer, Mycotic Diseases Branch, CDC.\nMark Pandori, PhD, director, Nevada State Public Health Laboratory; associate professor of pathology, University of Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine.\nTina Tan, MD, infectious disease specialist, Lurie Children’s Hospital, Chicago.\nJeffrey Rybak, PharmD, PhD, pharmacist and antifungal resistance researcher, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis.\nJohn Rex, MD, chief medical officer, F2G; former member, Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee, FDA.\nDangers that can result from high blood sugar.\nPotentially serious physical effects of alcohol abuse.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Cost May Lead Many to Skip COVID Testing: Why That's a Problem", "date": "2023-09-14 18:06:20", "text": "Sept. 14, 2023 – For Becky Robertson of Dallas, COVID-19 testing is taking a toll on her wallet now that the federal government and her insurance are no longer covering the cost. She said she pays around $30 per test to protect herself and her family. It’s gotten so pricey, in fact, that instead of testing, when she or a family member shows symptoms, they may quarantine at home rather than shelling out more money to know for sure. \nAnd she’s not the only one. Katie Camero, a recently laid-off journalist from Edison, NJ, said she, too, has been struggling with the rising cost of COVID testing. Her husband is a medical student who’s constantly fighting a scratchy throat and other symptoms as he runs around the hospital. Because of his exposure, they both test themselves frequently to protect those around them.\nWhen one of her close friends has a new baby, for example, she likes to test out of an abundance of caution before visiting. Still, Camero said, “it’s getting really expensive to be considerate.”\nWith the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency on May 11, the federalgovernment is no longer covering the cost of COVID PCR and antigen testing. But it’s worth noting that at-home antigen testing is still covered through Medicaid until 2024. Medicare will cover COVID testing at no cost if it’s prescribed by a doctor, which includes PCR and antigen tests done at a doctor’s office or hospital but not tests done at home.\nDuring the public health emergency, the tests were required to be covered by insurance so that they were of no cost to insured patients. But since then, decisions about coverage have moved back to either the states, employers, or insurance companies. “Those on private insurance are finding that COVID testing now looks like flu testing in terms of cost,” said Christina Silcox, PhD, research director, Digital Health, at the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy in Washington, DC.. \nThis comes after a surge in cases and hospitalizations. Nationally, COVID hospitalizations are up by 9% for the week ending Sept. 2 and COVID deaths are up by 10%, according to the CDC. And there’s a greater concern that we don’t yet know the true size of the surge because cost may lead some to skip testing, which means that people who don’t know they have an infection are less likely to take rigorous precautions to stop its spread. \n“When you add cost to COVID exhaustion, you increase the incentive not to test at all,” Silcox said. \nWhile the data doesn’t yet show us whether cost is stopping people from getting tested, it’s likely a factor, which may also mean that we’re not gathering enough information about the virus. Rajeev Fernando, MD, an infectious disease expert and fellow at Harvard Medical School, is concerned that we’re no longer gathering accurate data on infections both to fully understand the level of a surge and also to see mutations in infection that can lead to new treatments and updated vaccinations. \n“There’s been a significant decrease in bio-surveillance worldwide,” he said. “Countries used to report new variants to the World Health Organization, and now we’re just not seeing it.”\nBut Fernando notes that in the U.S., the CDC does have its National Wastewater Surveillance System that monitors levels of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in wastewater, and those numbers currently track with increases we’re seeing in hospitals.\nStill, it’s important to take data about the recent surge in context, he said. While the CDC is reporting there is a surge, that’s compared to an all-time low level of infections. In January 2022, for example, the U.S. had close to 146,000 hospitalizations, compared to current numbers that are around 6,500. \n“It’s a high-increase percentage from a very low number of COVID cases,” Fernando said. The severity of illness is likely significantly lower because around 95% of Americans have some level of immunity, either from vaccination or from infection, he said.\nOther experts worry that those who don’t test will delay treatment, which could affect care. Many COVID treatments that are known to be the most effective, including Paxlovid and metformin, need to be given within the first week of an infection. Paxlovid is an antiviral pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations by 89% in high-risk people, and metformin has been shown to cut the risk of getting long COVID from an acute infection by 41%. For those who don’t know they have COVID, symptoms may end up getting much worse before they seek treatment. \n“It’s foolish for insurance companies not to cover the cost of testing, because they may end up paying for many more days in the ICU,” said Grace McComsey, MD, who leads the long COVID RECOVER study at University Hospitals Health System in Cleveland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you add cost to COVID exhaustion, you increase the incentive not to test at all,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor those who don’t test or seek treatment, a mild infection can still lead to long COVID, which McComsey said is a far greater threat to many patients than an acute infection. According to the CDC, 7.5% of Americans already have long COVID symptoms, including intense fatigue, chronic pain, shortness of breath, and chest pain lasting 3 or more months after first getting an infection. \nBoth at home and around the globe, and even with the added cost, it's still important to test, said Silcox. Those who can’t afford at-home tests may still find free testing at a community health center, public health department, libraries, or other local organizations. You can also buy tests ahead of time, before you’re sick; using drugstore coupons; or you can buy them online or in bulk for a cheaper price. The CDC also has a No-Cost COVID Test Locator on its website. \n“If you have them in the house before you get sick, then you’re not at the mercy of retail pricing,” Silcox said. \nAnd if you’re not testing, be sure to quarantine when you’re feeling symptoms and remember that at-home tests are not perfect. “You can be infected for a day or two before they pop positive,” said Silcox. So if you’re going around older or immunocompromised individuals, don’t underestimate the power of a high-quality mask – they’re cheaper and they save lives. \nSOURCES:\nBecky Robertson, Dallas. \nKatie Camero, Edison, NJ.\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities: “Coverage for COVID-19 Testing, Vaccinations, and Treatment.”\nChristina Silcox, PhD, research director, Digital Health, Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, Washington, DC.\nRajeev Fernando, MD, infectious disease expert, fellow, Harvard Medical School, Boston. \nGrace McComsey, MD, director, long COVID RECOVER study, vice president of research, associate chief scientific officer, University Hospitals Health System, Cleveland.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nLingering symptoms after weeks or months?

{"title": "Obesity: A Holistic Approach", "date": "2023-09-18 19:00:54", "text": "\nThere’s no secret trick for \nlosing weight\n. Truth is, many things work together to help you shed unwanted pounds. \nIn the WebMD webinar,\n\"Holistic Obesity Therapy,\"\nOctavia Pickett-Blakely, MD, MHS, explained the holistic approach to weight management, why lifestyle choices are key, and when anti-obesity meds (AOMs) and medical procedures might come into play.\nShe is director of the GI Nutrition, Celiac Sprue, and Obesity Program at Penn Medicine. \n“To reach your weight loss goals, there’s no magic,” says Pickett-Blakely. “The key to managing obesity and weight loss lies in the development of healthy habits and lifestyle practices that you’ll carry throughout the course of your life.”\nLifestyle habits like exercise, weight training, diet, sleep, and stress management are the foundation for successful weight loss, said Pickett-Blakely.\nA poll of more than 1,100 webinar attendees found that 48% want to work on getting more \nexercise or more strength training\n. That’s followed by 28% who want to focus on eating healthier.\nQuestion: I want to work on:\nAnother poll asked about sleep. Pickett-Blakely explained that good sleep habits are necessary for weight management. That’s because good sleep translates into more energy to exercise and the ability to choose healthy eating options. If you combine good sleep with other healthy habits, you’re more likely to see your weight come down.\nAround half of respondents said they keep a regular bedtime, while 20% said that they create a relaxing space without distractions.\nQuestion: When it comes to sleep, I make it a habit to:\nIt combines different areas of weight loss, focusing on lifestyle first, and then other tools that can help you lose weight. For example, it involves how you and your doctor might combine your healthy habits with AOMs and endoscopic procedures. \n“Medications and surgeries for weight loss get a lot of attention,” says Pickett-Blakely. “But the foundational aspects for weight loss are absolutely critical to your success, before those things.”\nWhy do people snack late at night when they’re not hungry?\nHow healthy is intermittent fasting when you have diabetes?\nHow important is sleep in weight management?\nLate-night snacking often doesn’t come from hunger. When you get the sensation that you want to eat, typically it's related to your blood sugar being low. Sometimes you can also have a sensation of hunger when you’re thirsty. It can be difficult to separate these.\nLate-night eating often comes as a behavior. When you're younger, you go to the movies, you eat popcorn, you drink a beverage. I encourage my patients to stop before they eat something and ask, “Am I really hungry, or thirsty?”\nAnother option is to avoid staying up late if you don’t need to. If you have to stay up late because your work shift is late, for example, you’re not necessarily eating, because you're doing your job. It’s when you stay up late, at home, and you have the ability and freedom to late-night snack.\nWith\nintermittent fasting\n, it's important to talk to your doctor or health care provider who’s managing your diabetes. Because not every person with diabetes is created equal.\nIndividuals have different levels of management, and different levels of severity, of diabetes. That plays a role in whether or not intermittent fasting is appropriate for you.\nIn terms of sleep, I don't think people realize how important it is when it comes to weight loss. It’s a part of the weight loss recipe that many people neglect.\nWhen you don't get enough sleep, studies show you have increased hunger and more cravings. Being sleep-deprived is also linked to weight gain. There are changes in how your brain responds to certain things around you. For example, if you’re sleep-deprived and see commercials for food, the way you react to those is different when you're tired, compared to when you're rested.\nIf you're having difficulty sleeping, talk to your doctor or health care provider about how you can be tested or treated for sleep issues.\nIs it harder to lose weight after menopause?\nAre yoga and tai chi types of exercise or stress relief?\nHow overweight does someone need to be before they get help from weight loss medications or procedures?\nIt’s true that it’s harder to lose weight after menopause. Our basal metabolic rate, or metabolism, has a set point with which we burn energy. That set point starts to decline as early as in your second decade. So, after your 20s, your energy burn speed declines. That gets slower after you hit menopause – and further declines after menopause.\nOther things are happening with menopause, too. Your hormones shift a lot. These play a role in cravings and hunger. Hormones also create a shift in your body's muscle-to-fat ratio. So, you may see changes in the distribution of your weight, especially in your stomach fat. That can affect how easy or hard it is to lose or achieve a certain goal. This is why strength training and keeping a good amount of muscle is very important.\nYoga and tai chi are both exercise and stress relief. They’re good for resistance training as well. You hold poses, use muscle control, and engage your core strength. In certain cases, yoga and tai chi may be your only options for what you’re physically able to do.\nIt’s important to realize that everyone’s weight loss journey is different. Some people have been overweight for years, while others have more recently had to focus on it. Weight and body size differ around the world – and by culture, too. \nI think healthy lifestyle modifications, like being active, are incredibly helpful, regardless of your \nbody mass index\n. Typically, we recommend starting with lifestyle modifications when you’re in the overweight category, or if you have most of your extra weight in your belly.\nIf you’re in the overweight category but have other conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, you should talk with your doctor about additional therapies. At the end of the day, it’s important to talk to them about your body’s specific needs, to find the best approach for your goals.\nWatch a replay of the WebMD webinar\n\"Holistic Obesity Therapy.\"\nWatch other free \nWebMD webinars\n by leading experts on a variety of health topics.\nTest your knowledge of different types.\nWhat to know before taking them.\nAre they closer than you think?\nWhat to expect.\n© 2005 - 2019 WebMD LLC.

{"title": "Q&A: Wait, How Do I Protect Myself, Others From COVID Again?", "date": "2023-09-19 15:36:19", "text": "Sept. 18, 2023 – Americans may have a range of opinions on hot-button issues, but they seem to align on at least one: Wishing COVID-19 was truly behind us once and for all.\nBut 4 months after the CDC announced the COVID public health emergency was officially over, hospitalizations have increased almost 9% and deaths have risen almost 5% from the previous week, according to the most recent CDC data. \nLike it or not, the recent COVID uptick could mean a return to testing, isolation, and masking. So what are the recommendations again? The CDC’s guidance around COVID hasn’t changed much: If you test positive, isolate from everyone for 5 days and then, depending on whether symptoms are improving or if you still have a fever, you may need to continue to isolate. \nBut more than 3 years into the pandemic, with the public emergency over, are those guidelines still the most effective and reasonable? WebMD reached out to an emergency room doctor, a family doctor, and an infectious disease expert for a refresher. \nQ: What should you do if you are sick and think you might have COVID? Should you still isolate until you have test results?\nA: Leana Wen, MD, emergency medicine doctor and health policy professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.: Everybody should keep a supply of rapid home antigen tests on hand so they can take a test as soon as they develop symptoms. This is particularly important if they live with individuals who are more vulnerable to severe illness. If that is the case, they should isolate from those individuals while they are symptomatic regardless of test results. \nA: Dana Hawkinson, MD, infectious disease doctor and medical director of infection prevention and control, University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, KS: It is always best to have a plan if you become symptomatic and/or diagnosed with COVID-19. It still is very important to test early if you have symptoms. Look for free testing sites that may be available through state or county agencies, ask your doctor's office or local hospital if they have testing, or perform at-home testing. However, for at-home testing you may need to test on a couple of different days 24-48 hours apart. And yes, if you are symptomatic, try to stay home and isolate and wear a mask when around others.\nQ: How long should you isolate if you get a positive test result or diagnosis? Should you stay home from work and isolate from family?\nA: Wen: There is some misunderstanding about CDC guidelines. The agency recommends someone with mild symptoms isolate until after day 5, with “day zero” being the day of their positive test. That person should stay away from others in the same household, sleeping and eating in a separate room if possible. \nBut after day 5, it becomes a bit complicated. The CDC guidelines technically state people should continue isolating, but they can be in the same space if they wear a mask. That recommendation was made more so that individuals can go back to work if they're essential workers or take public transportation if they have to get to work. The misunderstanding comes because some individuals believe that after day 5, they're able to go back to having meals with their elderly grandparents.\nA: Hawkinson: The best practice is to always stay home if you are ill. You may end your isolation if 5 days have passed since symptoms started, you are fever-free for 24 hours, and your symptoms are improving if you have or had mild illness. Wear a mask and try to avoid others, if possible, through day 10. With moderate illness, such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, isolation through 10 days after symptom onset is recommended.\nQ: What should you do if you continue to test positive or experience symptoms over an extended period of time?   How should you proceed with life activities like going to the office or place of worship, taking the kids to practice, etc.?\nA: Tochi Iroku-Malize, MD, MPH, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and family doctor in Long Island, NY: Anyone who has been infected with COVID-19 can develop long COVID, which is considered as a possibility when someone does not return to their normal state of health following acute COVID-19 illness. Long COVID conditions might also include development of new or recurrent symptoms after the symptoms of acute COVID-19 illness have resolved, including brain fog, muscle fatigue, shortness of breath, and extended loss of taste and smell. Experts are still working to understand more about who experiences long COVID and the long-term effects.\nA: Hawkinson: Symptoms may linger for weeks. The important thing is to determine if the symptoms are improving from a time when they were the worst. The CDC addresses testing only in saying that you may consider testing with an antigen test when you would like to remove your mask prior to 10 days after symptoms onset. In this case you would want two negative antigen tests at least 48 hours apart.\nQ: What if you’re back to normal but confused on how to protect children or other family members? Should you monitor children, take off work for weeks at a time, etc.?\nA: Iroku-Malize: It can be stressful managing family, business, and social obligations while COVID-19 is still at large. If you do get sick, your family physician can help you make a health plan that works best for you and your family members.\nA: Hawkinson: We know attack rates of household contacts can be fairly high. It is best to continue to monitor others around you for symptoms, in your personal or family sphere, who may have been exposed. If it is felt there was exposure, the recommendation is to mask and monitor for symptoms for the next 10 days, with testing recommended 5 full days after the exposure, provided they have not experienced symptoms.\nQ: How useful are at-home COVID tests at this point?\nA: Iroku-Malize: At-home self-tests for COVID-19 are still useful and effective. I tell my patients that testing can be helpful even when you don’t have symptoms or a recent exposure to COVID-19, such as before an event or visiting someone, to ensure you’re not inadvertently exposing others. \nThe most important thing you can do to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community is to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

{"title": "Is Obesity Different in Asian Americans? Expert Q&A", "date": "2023-09-19 18:36:40", "text": "Obesity is a medical condition that’s found everywhere. It’s nearly three times as common worldwide as it was in 1975, according to the World Health Organization. \nIn the U.S., almost 42% of U.S. adults have obesity, CDC data show. But it’s less common among Asian Americans. Some experts have suggested that the standard definition of obesity – having a BMI of 30 or higher – might not be the best fit for Asian Americans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJennifer Ng, MD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn this interview, Jennifer Ng, MD, a certified obesity medicine specialist in New York City and chair of the Obesity Medicine Association’s Outreach Committee, discusses how obesity affects Asian Americans and what they need to know about this condition. This interview was edited for length and clarity.\nWebMD: How did you get interested in obesity medicine?\nNg: When I started practicing medicine, many of the patients I saw had elevated BMI, and this was across different socioeconomic classes. I was very surprised. This wasn’t something I was aware of when I was in medical school or residency. Medical school didn’t equip me to handle this or tell me how to counsel patients. It’s frustrating when you’re trained to be the person giving the answers and you just have no answers. I wanted to learn more.\nWebMD: How do obesity rates within the Asian American community compare to other demographics?\nNg: The obesity rate among Asian Americans is roughly 11%, which is lower compared with many other ethnicities. Under the current criteria, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 and above is considered overweight and 30 and above is considered obesity, and that’s applied across the board.\nBut there’s concern that we may not be capturing the full spectrum of the issue because BMI and the standard for measurement for obesity and being overweight is based on people of European descent. \nThere are some differences between ethnicities that we need to be cognizant of. Some guidelines suggest that perhaps we should consider Asian Americans to be overweight and having obesity at a lower BMI – a BMI of 23 and above for being overweight and 25 and above for having obesity – because there seems to be an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease at a lower body weight among Asian Americans. \nWebMD: Do overweight and obesity rates differ between different subpopulations of Asian Americans?\nNg: Different subgroups within the Asian community can have different rates of being overweight or having obesity. For example, Filipino Americans and South Asians tend to have a higher rate compared to East Asians. I will say that things change depending on how long you’ve lived in this country. Higher BMI seems to be associated with living in the United States longer. \nWebMD: When we use a standard like BMI that’s based on one population of people like Caucasians or those of European descent and then generalize those findings across all populations, what do we potentially miss? \nNg: We want to make sure we don’t apply one standard to everyone because people are different. People of different ethnic backgrounds are at different risks. When we use only one standard, sometimes we under-diagnose or under-screen certain populations or overdiagnose or over-screen other populations. \nWebMD: How does this impact the Asian American population?\nNg: There’s a lot of misconception out there. I have a lot of Asian Americans that come into my office who don’t think that being overweight and having obesity is an Asian problem because there is a tendency for Asian Americans to run on the thinner side, they don’t have a family history, or they don’t eat a Western diet. They may think they don’t need to exercise or worry about their diet. \nPrimary care doctors may not be aware either and they may under-diagnose or under-screen Asian American patients. \nWebMD: Why do Asian Americans experience cardiovascular and metabolic disease at a lower BMI compared to other populations?\nNg: You can gain fat in different ways. The size of the fat cell can increase, or the number of fat cells can increase. There’s genetic variation in how people store fat. It seems that, especially in the South Asian community, there’s a tendency for fat cell size to increase, which appears to be more problematic than increasing the number of fat cells. The fat becomes “sick” and starts to produce inflammatory markers and abnormal hormones, which can lead to a lot of the issues we see with metabolic disease. \nThere’s some thought that within the East Asian and South Asian community, there’s an increased tendency to store fat as visceral fat too. It’s the more dangerous fat that is stored in and around the organs. Our organs aren’t equipped to store fat, so they then become dysfunctional. That can lead to increased cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cholesterol issues.\nFor example, if you store more fat in the liver, it leads to inflammation because the fat produces inflammatory markers and interrupts the functioning of normal liver cells. This can lead to problems metabolizing cholesterol, glucose, and fat. If your glucose control is impaired because your liver isn’t working properly, your pancreas starts to release more and more insulin. That can lead to diabetes, and insulin itself causes fat cells to grow. \nWebMD: Aside from genetics, what else seems to be driving the rates of overweight and obesity among Asian Americans? Do diet and exercise among Asian Americans play a role?\nNg: Diet and lifestyle certainly play a role, but so do environmental factors. If people work a lot, live far from work, don’t have the opportunity to eat healthy food, and aren’t physically active, it becomes problematic. The diet that may have worked for them before moving to America, where they were more active and less sedentary, might not be OK here. \nThere are misconceptions about exercise among my patients of Asian descent, especially the older ones who didn’t grow up in America. They say, “This isn’t something that Asian people do. It’s too much. It’s too intense.”\nWebMD: How do you counsel your Asian American patients?\nNg: Every patient is different. I’m a primary care doctor, so when they come to me, I assess their overall health, diet, and exercise and see where they are. Regardless of BMI or weight, I educate them on healthy diets and exercise. \nWhen I see patients of Asian descent in my office, I am more vigilant. I do use the lower BMI criteria to counsel my patients and to start checking symptoms to consider whether they could be at risk for cardiovascular or metabolic disease. I also use waist circumference to evaluate patients because BMI doesn't always accurately tell you about body composition. Waist circumference can be a better marker of visceral fat, which is a more concerning risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease.\nYou don’t want to alienate your patient. You want them to come back. I try to meet them where they are because you can’t bulldoze over them and their culture. I’ll suggest tai chi, which is a gentle exercise that helps build balance and strengthen muscles, or bodyweight exercises like carrying their groceries. I’ll suggest trying brown rice or wild rice or cutting down on portions. Little changes are better than no changes.\nWebMD: What do you want Asian Americans to know? What message do you have for them?\nNg: My main message is just because you’re thin or in the normal range of the standard BMI criteria, it doesn’t mean that you’re not at risk. It’s still important to eat healthy, exercise, and see your doctor regularly. Many conditions are reversible if you catch them early enough, even if you have a genetic predisposition. There are changes you can make to your diet or lifestyle that can impact obesity and other disease risks.\nPHOTO CREDITS:\nPhoto courtesy of Jennifer Ng, MD.\nSOURCE:\nJennifer Ng, MD, certified obesity specialist; associate editor, Obesity Pillars, a journal of the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA); chair, OMA outreach committee.\nTest your knowledge of different types.\nWhat to know before taking them.\nAre they closer than you think?\nWhat to expect.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Glaucoma: A Hidden Threat to Vision Health Rising Swiftly", "date": "2023-09-20 17:09:10", "text": "Sept. 19, 2023 – A silent disorder is rising among older people worldwide, as millions unknowingly grapple with glaucoma – an eye condition that can cause irreversible blindness but shows no obvious symptoms until late-stage disease, ophthalmologists warn.\nIt's predicted that by 2050, the number of people with glaucoma will surge by more than 200%, highlighting an urgent need for heightened awareness, early detection, and advanced treatment strategies.\n“That's a lot of people with a blinding disease who don't know they have it,” said Joel S. Schuman, MD, a professor of ophthalmology and co-director of the Glaucoma Service at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. “Late in the disease, people may notice they're tripping over the curb, or walking into things they didn't see. It really is only in very advanced disease that people notice there's anything wrong.”\nGlaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 3 million people in the United States, and yet half of those affected are unaware, according to the CDC. \nRecent research at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden underscores glaucoma’s stealthy nature: 5% of 560 70-year-olds had the disease, and half of those did not know they had it before they took part in the study. \n“Living with glaucoma, especially without realizing it, can be very isolating,” said Lena Havstam Johansson, a PhD student at the University of Gothenburg and a specialist nurse at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, who did the study. “It may lead people to stay at home to avoid the trouble.”\nOnce symptoms arise, some may notice patchy blind spots in their peripheral vision, and in their central vision in late stages.\nWhile many people assume they are getting clumsier with age, Schuman said, they often have a condition that can be slowed with the right treatment. \nGlaucoma occurs when there is increased pressure within the eye, causing damage to the optic nerve, which transmits information from the eye to the brain. If left untreated, it will result in partial vision loss or complete blindness. It often develops gradually and without noticeable symptoms in its early stages, earning it the nickname \"the silent thief of sight.”\nThough there are various types of the disease, about nine in 10 people in the U.S. have primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).  \nIt is most common among people over the age of 60, those with a family history of glaucoma, and people who have diabetes. It disproportionately affects Black people, who are six times more likely than White people to have advanced vision loss from the disease. \nMore than 120,000 people in the U.S. are blind from glaucoma, accounting for 9% to 12% of all cases of blindness. \nGlaucoma treatments range from eyedrops to laser treatments to surgery, all of which aim to reduce eye pressure. Some doctors will recommend oral medication along with eyedrops.\n“We have a lot of treatment options, and they work pretty well,” Schuman said. “But the first step is the person knowing they have glaucoma, and the second step is that person seeking care.\nRarer types of glaucoma include normal-tension glaucoma, which is more common among people of Japanese ancestry, and congenital glaucoma, which is present from birth and affects about one in 10,000 babies born in the U.S.\nThe best way to ensure early detection and treatment is to get regular eye exams – every 2 to 4 years for adults under the age of 55, and annually thereafter, said Annie Wu, MD, a clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Kellogg Eye Center at the University of Michigan. \nThe fact that glaucoma’s symptoms are slow to develop, coupled with a lack of access to eye specialists many Americans face, make the disease even more dangerous. \nThe University of Pennsylvania is among those trying to change that. The Philadelphia school has hosted free glaucoma screening programs for Black residents. Black Americans are five to six times more likely to be diagnosed with glaucoma, the school said. \nThere are a number of organizations that also offer access to free glaucoma screening. \nGlaucoma testing can be done during a regular eye exam and may involve one test or a combination of tests that are relatively quick and painless. Those include dilating the pupil with eyedrops to examine the optic nerve, along with measuring thickness of the cornea to find out your risk for the disease, which is higher if the cornea is thin.\n “It is important not to wait until you have symptoms – if glaucoma is getting so bad you're starting to notice it in your central vision, it means you've lost pretty much all of your peripheral field,” Wu said. “Definitely go see an eye doctor, no matter what your family history is.”\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology: “The Changing Face of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma in the United States: Demographic and Geographic Changes from 2011-2050.”\nActa Ophthalmologica: “The prevalence of glaucoma in a 70-year-old Swedish population in the city area of Gothenburg.”\nJoel S.

{"title": "ADHD Med Errors Among Kids Have Surged in Last 2 Decades", "date": "2023-09-20 18:16:25", "text": "Sept. 20, 2023 – Medication errors among children who take drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, reported to U.S. poison control centers increased by nearly 300% over a 22-year period, a new study published in the journal Pediatrics has found.\nThe dramatic jump is likely due to a rise in prescriptions for ADHD medications for children. In 2019, nearly 10% of children in the United States had been diagnosed with ADHD, and some 3.3 million – or about 5% of all children in the country – had received a prescription for an ADHD medication, according to the study authors. \n\"Because therapeutic errors are preventable, more attention should be given to patient and caregiver education and development of improved child-resistant medication dispensing and tracking systems,\" the authors wrote. \nThe investigators analyzed data from the National Poison Data System from 2000 through 2021 for therapeutic errors linked to ADHD medication among patients younger than 20. \n\"As medicine changes, it's nice to look back at some of these things and see how some of these problems have changed,\" said Natalie I. Rine, PharmD, a co-author of the study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.\nThe researchers identified 124,383 such errors reported to U.S. poison centers during the study period. The frequency increased by 299%.\nTwo-thirds (66.6%) of the exposures involved children aged 6 to 12 years, three-fourths (76.4%) were among males, and half (50.5%) involved stimulants and related compounds. Most (79.7%) therapeutic errors were linked to exposure to a single substance. Nearly 83% of patients did not receive treatment at a health care facility. But 2.3% were admitted to the hospital, and 4.2% had a \"serious medical outcome,\" the researchers found.\nThe most common scenarios were \"inadvertently taken or given medication twice\" (53.9%), followed by \"inadvertently taken or given someone else's medication\" (13.4%) and \"wrong medication taken or given\" (12.9%), according to the researchers. Two percent involved mistakes by a pharmacist or nurse.\nEasily Preventable\nRine said simple mistakes caused the errors, which were likely the product of busy households and distracted caregivers. She said that the errors are easily avoided by storing the medication properly, keeping a sheet with the medication to document what was taken and when, and using a pillbox or one of many apps that can help document the dispensing of medications.\n\"I think the biggest thing is that a lot of these errors are preventable, more than anything else,\" Rine said.\nThe increase in ADHD diagnoses among children and the subsequent prescribing of medications are reasons for the nearly 300% increase in poison control calls. A 2018 study showed that the estimated prevalence of ADHD diagnoses among US children and adolescents increased from 6.1% in 1997 to1998 to 10.2% in 2015 to 2016. The CDC states that 6 million children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years have been diagnosed with ADHD, and 62% have received ADHD medication.\nColleen Kraft, MD, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said she was not surprised by the reported increase in errors. In addition to the simple uptick in ADHD diagnoses and prescriptions in the past 2 decades, Kraft said the growing variety of ADHD medication is a cause of more errors.\n\"Because we have so many more different types of these medications, it's easy to confuse them, and it's easy to make an error when you give this to a child,\" she said. \nKraft also said that since ADHD can have a genetic component, some parents with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD may be responsible for their child's medication, a scenario ripe for mistakes.\nPotential Dangers\nNot all ADHD medicinal overdosing is created equal, Kraft pointed out. Doubling up on a stimulant such as methylphenidate, more commonly known as Ritalin, or the combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, or Adderall, may cause headaches, suppress appetite, and cause an upset stomach, although those symptoms usually clear up in a few hours.\nBut, she noted, the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers is more concerning. Also used to treat high blood pressure, medications such as guanfacine and clonidine sedate you. A double dose can cause blood pressure to decrease to dangerous levels.\nThe study's primary limitation was bias in self-reporting, which may have led to underreporting of cases, according to the researchers. Not every case in which an error occurs that involves a child taking ADHD medication gets reported to poison control, because some will take a wait-and-see approach and may not call if their child doesn't have symptoms. \n\"Our data is only as good as what the callers report to us,\" Rine said.\nSOURCES: \nPediatrics: \"Pediatric ADHD Medication Errors Reported to United States Poison Centers, 2000 to 2021.\"\nNatalie I.

{"title": "Fitness for People in Wheelchairs", "date": "2023-09-20 21:19:48", "text": "In 2018, NikkiWalsh’s life took a sudden turn when she woke up in a hospital bed, paralyzed from the chest down from a car accident. Despite her challenges, a new purpose emerged from her limited mobility. Walsh, a 33-year-old certified personal trainer with a degree in kinesiology and exercise science from Penn State University, helps people in the wheelchair community, including herself, harness the power of fitness. \nA year after that near-deadly accident, Walsh decided to shift her focus from trying to walk again to rebuilding her overall strength, focusing on the muscles she uses most: her upper body and core. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNikki Walsh\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nShe felt nervous about going to the gym solo, a barrier faced by many wheelchair users, she says, so she asked a friend and fellow personal trainer for support. Since then, “exercise has been my saving grace,” Walsh says. “I feel like myself again.” \nStronger muscles can help you transfer in and out of your wheelchair. But exercising around people gives Walsh a sense of community and an outlet to ease stress and anxiety.  “When you’re just sitting around alone thinking about your disability, you’re way more likely to be in a down mood,” she says. \nExercise can be a challenge if you have limited mobility, but it’s important to get enough of it. Regular physical activity can lower your odds of getting health problems that stem from inactivity and long-term wheelchair use. \nThe good news is, “there’s adaptive everything at this point,” Walsh says. “No matter your abilities, you’ll be able to find something that works for you.” \nAccording to Frank Greco, a certified inclusive fitness trainer at Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital near Chicago, all adults, including people who use wheelchairs, should aim for at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week along with 2 to 3 days of strengthtraining, if possible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank Greco, right, works with Sue Lephew.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBut everyone’s starting fitness levels and abilities are different. While you should still try to exercise at least 3 to 5 days a week, “you can start at the bare minimum,” Greco says, “and then adjust your goals as you go along.” \nIn general, wheelchair users should target endurance and strength in the upper body, Greco says, especially the muscles in your shoulders, wrists and hands, rotator cuff, triceps, and trunk – the muscles in your lower back, upper back, chest, and abs. And don’t forget to stretch. \nBy improving your overall fitness, upper body strength, and flexibility, Greco says, you’re less likely to get overuse injuries and muscular imbalances that are common among people in wheelchairs. Regular exercise can also go a long way to boost your quality of life, self-esteem, and self-reliance.\nIndependence – getting it back or maintaining it – is a huge goal for many wheelchair users when it comes to fitness. And a strong upper body and core can give you the confidence and power to go from your wheelchair “into your bed, onto the couch, into a car, or onto the toilet,” Walsh says, “without constantly relying on a caregiver, friend, or family member.” \nOther benefits of regular exercise for wheelchair users include: \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank Greco, left, with Sue Lephew\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSue Lephew, 55, a client who works with Greco, is a big believer in the benefits of exercise for wheelchair users. Lephew hasn’t been able to walk since her spinal cord injury at the age of 17. She’s developed back and nerve problems after 38 years of sitting, but regular exercise helps ease some of that pain. \nIncreased strength and stability have also lessened her fear of falling when she transfers and prevents pressure sores. “You can lift yourself a lot longer and do a better job of shifting your weight,” Lephew says. \nThere isn’t one type of physical activity that’s best for everyone. It depends on your abilities, fitness goals, and what you want to do with your body every day. But there are three types of exercises to focus on: cardiovascular, strengthening, and flexibility. \nFlexibility exercises include things like adapted yoga or simple 5 to 10-minute stretches you do before or after a workout or during the day. Lephew stretches every day, sometimes “for hours.” \nWhen it comes to strength-training exercises for people who use wheelchairs, Greco recommends using weights or resistance bands to do a variety of things that target your big and little muscles, such as: \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank Greco, left, with Sue Lephew\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTrunk exercises are also key. “Including what we call the Pallof press,” Greco says, which is when you pull a weighted cable or resistance band toward the center of your chest while using your ab and back muscles to stabilize your core.\nTo further strengthen your belly, back, and upper body, Greco says, you can do the following: \nAny movement is better than none. But try to do aerobic exercises for at least 25 to 30 minutes most days of the week, if possible. What kind of cardio is best for people who use wheelchairs? “Really anything that’s going to get your heart rate up,” Greco says. \nExamples of aerobic exercises for people in wheelchairs include: \nLephew’s go-to for cardio is a tabletop arm bike. She uses it at home for 40 minutes a day, at least five days a week. She sometimes leads a small dumbbell workout class at the Marianjoy fitness center. “Arms by Sue, we call it,” Greco says. \nIf you have access to a safe space, you can exercise outside or inside your home. Check out the YouTube channel for the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD) if you’re looking for free exercise-from-home videos. \nBut rehabilitation centers and some mainstream gyms offer adaptive fitness classes and accessible exercise equipment, including weight-lifting machines that let you move the seat out of the way, so you don’t have to transfer out of your wheelchair.\nIf you’re new to exercise, ask your doctor to refer you to a fitness trainer or physical therapist who works with people who use a wheelchair. These exercise experts can create an at-home workout plan or teach you how to use free weights or adaptive equipment with or without a trainer at a gym. \n“There’s always an initial run through when someone first comes in (to the fitness center),” Greco says. “You don’t want someone sitting at a machine wondering: How the heck do I get this thing to move? How do I adjust the seat or turn myself?”\nYou might feel more comfortable working with an adaptive fitness trainer or athlete coach who has limited mobility themselves, like Walsh, who offers virtual or in-person workout sessions for people of all ability levels. “Many of my clients come to me saying they’re happy they found a wheelchair user who gets it,” Walsh says.   \nWhat if you meet with a physical therapist or trainer and you don’t click? “Keep searching,” Lephew says. “There’s going to be someone out there who understands you and your needs.”\nPhoto Credits:\nPhotos of Frank Greco and Sue Lephew: Courtesy Northwestern MedicineNIkki Walsh: Courtesy Nikki Walsh\nSOURCES:\nFrank Greco, certified inclusive fitness trainer, Northwestern Medicine Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital, Wheaton, IL. \nSue Lephew, spinal cord injury and wheelchair advocate, Warrenville, IL.\nNikki Walsh, personal trainer and nutrition coach, Nikki Walsh Adapt Fit LLC, Philadelphia. \nNational Institutes of Health Office of Disease Prevention: “Can Physical Activity Improve the Health of Wheelchair Users?”\nCDC: “Physical Activity for People with Disability.” \nNHS (UK): “Fitness advice for wheelchair users.”\nAging & Disability Resource Center of Dane County: “Recreational Resources.” \nPlanet Fitness: “Planet Fitness, Home of the Judgement Free Zone, and the Coalition for Inclusive Fitness, Announce Accessible Exercise Equipment Commitment Benefitting People with Disabilities.” \n\n\n\n\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "As U.S. Syphilis Cases Rise, Those at the Epicenter Scramble", "date": "2023-09-21 17:47:39", "text": "Sept. 21, 2023 – It was just a routine checkup – or so she thought. But this time, Marnina Miller’s love interest came along. The pair headed to an STD clinic in Houston, where Miller worked, to get tested for syphilis and HIV. \nWith an already compromised immune system due to an HIV diagnosis 9 years ago, it is critical for Miller to ensure she is clear of any other diseases. She tested negative for syphilis. Her partner, on the other hand, tested positive for latent (or stage 3) syphilis. \nSyphilis has been on the rise in the U.S. for more than 2 decades. From 2017 to 2021, the number of cases shot up 75% (to 176, 713), according to the CDC. Houston – the fourth largest city in the U.S. – seems to be at the epicenter. Between 2019 and 2022, there was a 128% rise in syphilis cases there, particularly among women and people of color, according to the Houston Health Department. This summer, drugmaker Pfizer reported a widespread shortage of the antibiotic penicillin, which is used to cure early-stage syphilis and treat latent syphilis. \n“I was immediately scared,” Miller said. “I was nervous about what that meant for me because we did kiss before. And although I am openly living with HIV, there is little education around syphilis and how it is contracted.”\nThe Houston Health Department has been warning Houstonites to take this public health crisis seriously by practicing safe sex and getting tested if they're sexually active. There has also been a nine-fold increase in congenital syphilis – which is when a pregnant mother passes the disease to her baby – in Houston and Harris County, TX. To help curb the spread, residents can now get free testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) at Houston health clinics. \n“It is crucial for pregnant women to seek prenatal care and syphilis testing to protect themselves from an infection that could result in the deaths of their babies,” said Marlene McNeese Ward, deputy assistant director of the Houston Health Department's Bureau of HIV/STI and Viral Hepatitis Prevention. She said a pregnant woman needs to get tested for syphilis three times during her pregnancy.\nThere are four stages of syphilis: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. (See each stage's symptoms here.) Oral, anal, and vaginal sex are some of the ways the disease can spread. Some people who contract syphilis never have symptoms and could have the disease for years without knowing.\nPenicillin can cure both syphilis and congenital syphilis. The antibiotic cannot reverse damage done to your organs via infection, especially if the disease has greatly progressed before treatment. \nTeriya Richmond, MD, explained what an average test day looks like. Upon arriving at the testing site, you will get checked in and learn about the types of STDs you can be tested for. The CDC recommends you get tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Syphilis tests are done through blood samples. Testing for other diseases include oral or anal swabs, and urine samples, said says Richmond, a board-certified family medicine doctor who specializes in women’s health. \nSergino Nicolas, MD, creates TikTok videos and Instagram reels to raise awareness about the outbreak. The Pittsburgh-based emergency medical doctor said there is often a “nonchalant” attitude toward STDs among some people in their 20s and 30s. Being unaware of the consequences of syphilis could drive that attitude. “With thoughts like ‘I can just get treated,’ I think there is danger in that, because when you have these infections, [irreversible] complications can occur,” he said.\nPreconceived notions among this age group that oral sex is a safer alternative to vaginal or anal sex is also common, Nicolas said. “Any time you might have infected secretions, or be exposed to mucosa, including the vaginal mucosa, that can result in spreading the infection.”\nWomen of color have been particularly impacted by the outbreak. Syphilis has a wide range of signs and symptoms, and that could play a major role, Nicolas said. Lack of education on the dangers of unprotected sex, particularly if you have multiple sexual partners, could be another reason, as doing so increases your rates of yeast infections and STDs, he said.\nAnother potential factor: Sexually explicit music and entertainment can also cloud judgment on whether to engage in sexual activity, Nicolas said. Younger generations can especially fall prey to this. “There have been new artists over the past few months that have really been pushing for ‘female empowerment’ in a sense,” he said. “At the same time, they can also push a narrative more so pertaining to promiscuity, which could result in certain psychological effects\" that could lead to unsafe sex practices.\nPublic health activists in Houston are spreading the word on the importance of getting tested for STDs. Kevin Anderson is the founder of the T.R.U.T.H. Project, a Houston-based nonprofit that educates and mobilizes LGBTQ communities of color through social arts that promote sexual, mental, and physical health.\nWhile celebrating its 10th anniversary, T.R.U.T.H. Project is creatively promoting syphilis education and awareness. The organization’s recent events have included an open-mic night called “Heart and Soul,” with free STD testing on site for attendees. It also hosted a sex-positive night aiming to educate attendees about STDs and safe-sex practices. Self-love, self-care, and self-awareness of your body is one of the group's most prominent messages. “If something feels or looks different, love yourself enough to be proactive in following up to find out what's going on – because avoidance leads to outbreaks,” Anderson said.\nMaybe you’re nervous that you might be STD-positive.

{"title": "'Beer Goggles' a Myth, but Alcohol’s Allure Real and Risky", "date": "2023-09-22 17:01:08", "text": "Sept. 22, 2023 -- We humans have a mixed relationship with alcohol. On one hand, it helps us relax after a stressful day and feel more at ease in social situations. But excessive use can impact your health, raising the risk of unsafe behavior, injuries, violence, and disease. \nNow researchers are saying that curbing those negative effects starts by better understanding alcohol’s appeal. Take a recent study into alcohol’s effects on men’s sexual urges. \nA couple of drinks does not give you “beer goggles” that make other people look more desirable, the study found. But being tipsy may make you more eager to approach an attractive stranger. \nAn amusing finding? Maybe. But it also raises questions about alcohol abuse.\n“While these findings may appear titillating, we hope that they contribute to a more serious objective, namely to better understand why some people are especially sensitive to alcohol’s alluring social effects,” said study co-author Michael Sayette, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, where the study was conducted. \nFor the study, in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, college men in a casual setting rated images of men or women depending on sexual orientation. They did this twice — when intoxicated on vodka and when sober.\nResult: Men with a buzz (average 0.07 breath alcohol concentration) didn’t rate images any higher than sober men. But when the men were told they might be able to meet the people they rated highly, they were 1.71 times more likely to want to meet their top choices when drinking than when sober.\nThat vodka-fortified confidence could be explained by a few factors, said study author Molly Bowdring, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University. “Drinking alcohol could cue people to be more social, or they may anticipate even prior to drinking that they’ll be better performers sexually when intoxicated,” Bowdring said.\nAlcohol may also reduce anxiety about rejection, she said. “Alcohol can limit the rumination on that, the thinking that, ‘Oh this interaction might go poorly,’ or ‘I might not be able to communicate the way I want to,’” Bowdring said.\nIn the study, the psychologists had 18 pairs of good friends (for a bar hangout vibe) drink vodka and cranberry drinks before rating images. The men could chat but not discuss their ratings.\nThe men had been told that after rating the images, they would be able to select their top four to potentially interact with in a future study. (That meet-up was never intended to be real.) On a separate occasion, the same pairs of men came into the lab and rated images while drinking alcohol-free cranberry drinks, as a point of comparison.\nThere’s nothing wrong with self-confidence, of course. But when you learn to rely on beer or tequila shots for courage -- especially, perhaps, if that confidence results in sex -- it could trigger or worsen alcohol abuse, Sayette said. \nA Sobering Issue\nAlcohol abuse has serious health consequences. According to an Australian study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Conference in Barcelona on Tuesday, patients who visited the emergency room for alcohol-related reasons returned 44% more times over the next 10 years, and were 138% more likely to die within the next 20 years, than patients whose illnesses or injuries were not caused by alcohol.\nOther research has found that alcohol-related deaths in the United States increased dramatically between 2007 and 2020. In 2021, they jumped again, to 108,791 alcohol-related deaths. That’s more than the number of drug overdoses from opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine combined. \nFor many of the 29.5 million Americans with alcohol use disorder, a lack of self-confidence could be at the root of the problem. “The majority of those with severe alcohol use disorder have this ‘learned hopelessness,’” said Daniel Farmer, DO, the medical director at the West Virginia University Medicine Center for Hope and Healing. “[They’ve] had a life in which their perception has become warped to the point that they feel nothing can change for the better.”\nTwelve-step programs, group therapy, and motivational interviewing, a counseling technique where the therapist tries to motivate you to stay sober, all aim to rebuild the patient’s self-confidence and willingness to improve their lives, Farmer said.\nAs for “beer goggles,” the small Pitt study does not prove it’s a myth.  The men in the study drank only to an average BAC of 0.07, below the legal limit in the United States. Most people drinking that amount “do not participate in risky behaviors” or lose inhibitions to the point of desiring another at a “higher level,” Farmer said.\nWhen Bowdring and Sayette analyzed 16 previous studies on the topic, they identified a small but statistically significant association between drunkenness and sexual attraction to another person. “I am not prepared to say that at this dose alcohol does not affect perceived physical attractiveness, just that we did not observe it in this study,” Sayette said. \nSayette said they hope the study demonstrates the importance of studying physical attraction in settings that mimic real life. Larger future studies could include volunteers who all drink together in a room, or even take the research out to a bar and interview the patrons. \nIt’s all part of an effort to uncover habits and behaviors that can lead to problem drinking. “If we can help people to understand what they’re getting out of their drinking experiences, they might be able to achieve their social goals without alcohol, whether it’s social bonding, or improved mood, or intimacy,” Bowdring said.\nSOURCES:\nMichael Sayette, PhD, professor of psychology, University of Pittsburgh.\nMolly Bowdring, PhD, postdoctoral scholar, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA.\nDaniel Farmer, DO, medical director, West Virginia University Medicine Center for Hope and Healing, Morgantown, WV. \nPrescription and over-the-counter medications.\nKnow when to seek medical attention.\nChanges that happen in the body and the mind.\nCauses, symptoms, and treatment.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Psychedelics Scientist Roland Griffiths Faces the End and Finds … Joy", "date": "2023-09-22 17:18:50", "text": "Griffiths talks about life after cancer with fellow psychedelics researcher Dr. Manish Agrawal.\nWhen last we spoke with Roland Griffiths, PhD, in the fall of 2021, psychedelic-assisted therapies were just starting to enter mainstream public consciousness – as WebMD explored with Griffiths’s help in an in-depth series Magic Mushrooms, MDMA, and the Promise of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy. \nFor Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist and an elder statesman of psychedelic research, it was a very gratifying time in both his professional and personal life. The psychedelic substances he had been studying in the lab for 2 decades were finally being taken seriously as medications that could help people with specific mental health issues like depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD. His personal relationships with those closest to him were good, and his primary relationship with his life partner, Marla, was a source of great meaning and sustenance. \nThen, just a few months after our conversation, doctors diagnosed Griffiths with end-stage colon cancer. He had every reason to be resentful and angry, as he’d been careful about his health and followed doctors’ orders regarding screenings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Manish Agrawal of Sunstone Therapies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGriffiths knew of the possibly devastating psychological toll of such a diagnosis through his previous research – the first of its kind – on psychedelic therapies for those with end-stage cancer.\nAnd yet, after the initial shock and denial that often come with such a diagnosis, he found something else: Joy. \n“I'm just overwhelmed with gratitude and joy and love for how I'm experiencing the world despite everything,” says Griffiths. \nThe response is as much a surprise and a mystery to him as it is to anyone else. And yet his feeling about his diagnosis has been clear and unalloyed. “What a tragedy it would have been,” he says, “if I had been run over by a bus on the way to that cancer screening.”\n“I would have missed so many amazing things.”\nThe diagnosis has shifted his priorities in profound ways, says Griffiths, bringing him closer to those he loves and making him more open about his own experiences with psychedelics – something he had been careful to avoid previously. \n“There are going to be some people who are going to think that I've not been an objective scientist. I don't think that's true, because I went into work for psychedelics as a skeptic. … Now I have some personal experience that I can also speak to.” \nSince the diagnosis, Griffiths also established an endowed professorship at Johns Hopkins University to support world-class research on psychedelic substances “to advance understanding of well-being and spirituality in the service of promoting human flourishing for generations to come.”\nHere, Griffiths and his wife, Marla Weiner, sit down with Manish Agrawal, MD, an oncologist and psychedelics researcher at Sunstone Therapies, to discuss Griffiths's diagnosis, his meditation practice, the psychedelic experience, and more. \nDifferences between feeling depressed or feeling blue.\nSigns of mania and depression.\nCauses, symptoms, and therapies.\nWhen food controls you.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Is Pneumonia The Surprising Root of Severe COVID?", "date": "2023-09-25 15:32:22", "text": "Sept. 25, 2023 -- As we continue to live with COVID-19, patients and doctors will learn more about the reasons infections can range from asymptomatic to very serious. Many researchers and doctors believe inflammation is the cause of severe COVID. This is due to the virus causing a \"cytokine storm\" that can adversely affect the organs in a patient's body, including the heart and lungs.\nNew research from Northwestern University and the University of Wisconsin, however, is pointing to bacterial pneumonia as the cause of many severe COVID deaths. Deceased COVID patients studied were not shown to have experienced inflammation at all. Instead, the researchers, using machine learning to analyze data, found that half of the severely ill COVID patients who required a ventilator had bacterial pneumonia as a secondary infection. They did not find evidence of a cytokine storm in these patients; instead of dying from organ damage or failure due to COVID, they died of pneumonia. \n“Critically ill patients who recovered from pneumonia were more likely to live,” said Benjamin D. Singer, MD, senior author of the study, professor of pulmonary medicine, and a Northwestern Medicine pulmonary and critical care doctor in Chicago.\nOther researchers don’t debunk the idea of cytokine storms in COVID, however. Cytokines are chemicals that are released when a person’s immune system overreacts to an infection. Too many cytokines are toxic and can cause organ failure. In COVID-19, cytokines have been thought to release inflammation that can circulate through the body and cause death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCritically ill patients who recovered from pneumonia were more likely to live.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA new study from CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology in Chandigarh, India, and M. M. Engineering College in Ambala, India, for example, found that controlling this inflammatory factor is essential in order to treat COVID. Italian researchers further find that hyperinflammation plays a definite role in severe illness in COVID patients.  \nAdditional new research does show that specific bacteria can cause negative outcomes for COVID patients. A study from the New York University Grossman School of Medicine found that bacteria from the gut may move into the blood of patients with severe COVID. “Bacteria circulating in the blood can accelerate complications in these COVID patients,” said study co-author Jonas Schluter, PhD of the Institute for Systems Genetics and assistant professor of microbiology at NYU Grossman in New York City.\nCan these findings affect any patient who is diagnosed with COVID-19 and may be at high risk for complications? Potentially, yes. A very important aspect of the Northwestern study is that it highlights the importance of screening susceptible COVID patients for pneumonia as soon as possible. The good news: Patients who test positive can immediately talk to their doctors about their risk factors and get the treatment they need to prevent serious illness. \nWho Is at Risk for Severe COVID?\nThe CDC reports that anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk for severe COVID. Other factors include:\nWhat Symptoms of COVID Are Emergency Warning Signs? \nAccording to the CDC, symptoms of COVID that can range from mild to severe include:\nThe following symptoms indicate a potentially more serious or critical progression of COVID-19:\nAnyone experiencing any or all of these symptoms should call 911 right away and explain that this is a confirmed or possible case of COVID.\nHow Is Severe COVID Treated? \nIf a patient tests positive and has risk factors, their doctor may prescribe one of three drugs to keep the illness from progressing: molnupiravir,  Paxlovid, or remdesivir. If a patient is hospitalized, additional drug therapy that reduces inflammation may be given, as well as blood plasma therapy.\nPatients will also be treated for any other infections they have, which is why it’s important to let health care providers know about new symptoms right away. \nWhat Can Be Done to Avoid Severe COVID-19?\nFirst, get vaccinated and boosted. “It’s the best way to prevent the likelihood of severe illness,” Singer said. “It’s very rare to see a fully vaccinated COVID patient critically ill in the ICU.”  \nIf a patient tests positive and has respiratory symptoms that are worsening, they should ask their doctor for a pneumonia screening. Antibiotics are often necessary to treat a co-infection, and Schluter had some unexpected but important advice: Stop eating junk food immediately. “You don’t want to eat rubbish because antibiotics and sweets do not mix,” he cautions. “Sugar from your diet, combined with antibiotics, can exacerbate damage to the organs in your body. COVID can create a forest fire in your body. Not consuming excess sugar can extinguish the flame.”\nThe most important things to do: Take all prescribed medication, isolate for at least 5 days, wear a high-quality N95 or KN5 mask around others, and don’t stress. Taking these steps means a patient is doing everything right, and everything possible, to have the least severe outcome with COVID-19.\nSOURCES:\nBenjamin D.

{"title": "Why MS Is Difficult to Diagnose", "date": "2023-09-26 15:21:50", "text": "After a weekend of knee boarding and outdoor activity, Laura Nixon noticed a tingling spot in her lower body. At first, she brushed it off as a simple injury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaura Nixon with her family\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“I really just thought that I was having some back problems,” she says.\nBut the tingling began to spread and get worse, so she scheduled an appointment with her doctor.\nAfter a referral to a neurologist, Nixon’s care team still didn't know what caused her pain.\n“They did an MRI on my back, and they couldn’t find anything,” she says.\nDuring the next few years, Nixon visited neurosurgeons, orthopedic doctors, neurologists, and chiropractors. Still, it started to get harder for her to walk and keep her balance.\nAt that point, she brought up the possibility of MS. But her doctors didn’t think that her symptoms fit.\n“It seemed like it was kind of taboo. No one really wanted to touch that diagnosis,” she says.\nWith few options left, Nixon’s neurologist suggested a spinal tap. After that, in August of 2019, she got a diagnosis of MS at the age of 50. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt seemed like it was kind of taboo. No one really wanted to touch that diagnosis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“It was a relief to know that I wasn’t crazy, but it was also devastating to know that I had a chronic illness,” Nixon says.\nBut why did it take 14 years to figure out that she had MS?\nMultiple sclerosis happens when there’s scarring in a part of your central nervous system. But there’s no test or list of symptoms that definitely signals the disease. So doctors look at symptoms and the results of diagnostic tests, like MRI scans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEspecially with milder symptoms, doctors may mistake MS for another medical issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“Depending upon where the scarring occurs, whether it’s in the brain or in the spinal cord … you can have very different symptoms that occur,” says Lily J. Henson, MD. She's the CEO of Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge, GA, and a member of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society board of directors.\nThe possibility of these different symptoms makes it harder for doctors to find MS right away. Some people may have symptoms of the condition and not even know it.\nMost people find out they have MS after they have an MRI.\nIt's rare, but doctors sometimes do something called a lumbar puncture to confirm the condition. That's when doctors take out some fluid around the spinal cord and examine it. They did this in Nixon's case.\nSometimes, though, a doctor's hunch isn't enough to get the test you need.\n“MRI is available in the United States, much more than any country in the world. But it’s still expensive. Health insurance has to cover it,” says Farrah J. Mateen, MD, PhD, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.\nShe says that in addition to insurance, there has to be a really strong case made to do the MRI in the first place.\nDoctors use a set of guidelines known as the McDonald Criteria to help diagnose MS.\nThey'll first determine if you show signs of a typical MS episode. After that, doctors must confirm that you’ve had MS symptoms in multiple places in your nervous system, and that they've happened more than once. Your doctors may call this “dissemination in time and space.”\nThis process can be simple. But there's no guarantee that it will be.\n“It can take 5 minutes, or it can take years,\" says Aaron E. Miller, MD. “It depends entirely on the circumstances.”\nThe catch is, to make an MS diagnosis, there must be no better reason for someone’s symptoms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore on Multiple Sclerosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSigns of MS can vary for each person.\nA common one is swelling in your eye’s optic nerve, called optic neuritis. Many people might notice numbness, tingling, or weakness on one side of their body. You may have trouble walking, balancing, or going to the bathroom.\nBut with these symptoms alone, doctors can’t confirm MS. Many other conditions have similar warning signs.\n“A vitamin B12 deficiency can mimic MS,\" Henson says. \"Lyme disease, lupus, or Sjogren's -- two other autoimmune diseases -- can also mimic MS. And then there are some very rare, inherited metabolic disorders that can mimic MS.\"\n\"It’s important to make sure that you’ve ruled those conditions out.”\nDoctors can write off “mimickers” through an MRI of your brain and spinal cord as well as repeated blood tests.\nIf your doctor finds no other condition and your symptoms meet the McDonald Criteria, you’ll likely get a diagnosis of MS.\nif you're thinking that there has to be a better way, doctors would like that, too. But they don’t expect a better method of MS diagnosis to come along any time soon.\n“We’d love to have a simple body fluid test, preferably blood or urine,\" Miller says. \"But I don’t think it’s likely to happen.”\nBut advances in technology offer hope for the future.\nMateen is studying a portable MRI that's about the size of a computer. This could be a game changer for people in low-income areas who need access to MRI tests.\n“What if you could actually make MRI really cheap and really simple for patients and even have it in more convenient locations?”\nPhoto Credit: Sandy Lingerfelt\nOURCES:\nLaura Nixon, Cumming, GA.\nLily J.

{"title": "What People With MS Wish You Knew", "date": "2023-09-26 15:29:19", "text": "When you live with a complex condition like multiple sclerosis (MS), there are a lot of misconceptions that can come along with it.\nFor example, many think people with MS are old, disabled, and end up in a wheelchair. That’s not entirely true. MS usually starts between ages 20 and 40. And while it may worsen over time, it looks different for different people.\nMS symptoms can range from mild to severe. They may flare up now and then or last for long periods of time. Some symptoms are visible while others may not be obvious. If you have MS, this can make it hard for those around you to understand what you’re dealing with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne minute you're feeling great, and then 5 minutes later, you're too fatigued to even get up and go to the bathroom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“MS is a very unpredictable disease. [It] can change from minute to minute. One minute you're feeling great, and then 5 minutes later, you're too fatigued to even get up and go to the bathroom,” says Daana Townsend, a 40-year-old educator from Milwaukee, WI.\nDoctors still don’t know exactly what causes or worsens MS. Although there’s no cure, treatments can slow the worsening of the conditions for some.\nThe uncertain nature of this chronic illness can take a toll on the day-to-day lives of people with MS. Explaining how they feel can be both difficult and exhausting. Here’s what they might want you to know.\nMS is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the central nervous system. This may block or slow down the communication between your brain and spine with the rest of the body. You can have numbness and tingling, balance problems, dizziness, vision issues, fatigue, or other things including problems with sex or your bladder and bowel.\n“I was very lucky to be diagnosed rather quickly after my first very obvious flare-up,” says Jenna Green, a 36-year-old MS advocate from Boston who was diagnosed in November 2015. She says that after an emergency room doctor missed her optic neuritis, a vision problem and an MS symptom in which you can have pain and blurriness in one eye, she saw a neurologist for a second opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMS has many symptoms, and it's rare for anyone to have all of them. That can make it tricky to diagnose\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAn MRI confirmed MS. Green has relapsing-remitting MS. It’s the most common type, with flare-ups that can come and go. It can last for a few days or even weeks. In between attacks, you may have mild or no symptoms.\nGarvis Leak, who was also diagnosed in November 2015, says his MS symptoms started with back problems 4 years after he retired from the Air Force.\n“I was sent to a neurosurgeon for the back pain. She told me point-blank, ‘Mr. Leak, yeah you have back problems, but you also have MS.’ Then she showed me lesions on my spine and neck,” says Leak, an entrepreneur from Dayton, OH.\nLeak went to the local Veterans Affairs clinic and was referred to a neurologist who confirmed it. Like Green, he sought a second opinion from a neurologist from a VA in Cleveland, OH. This time, he found a more specific answer: He has primary progressive MS. This type is less common. It can make your symptoms steadily worsen over time. \nFor Leak, who had been physically active all his life, the diagnosis felt it “was like a hit in the gut.”\nGreen recalls being a healthy 31-year-old in “the best shape of her life.” The MS diagnosis felt like the rug was pulled from underneath her. It took her a long time to tell people not in her immediate family.\n“It was very perplexing. It's a lot of emotions,” she says. “It causes a lot of grief. You don't realize it at the time.” It took her a while to take it in. She saw a therapist who told her that grieving is a process. Green resisted that at first. “She was right.”\n“I found that friends, close friends, and family -- even my parents -- they say that they understand, and they really don't.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't make someone with MS feel like they have to justify their disease to you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\"I have gone through periods of not feeling so well internally. But on the outside, I may seem fine. They say, ‘Oh, you look so good.’ And that is something that is said often to people who have MS,” says Dawn Morgan, 45-year-old teacher from Washington, DC, who was diagnosed nearly 20 years ago.\nMS symptoms like fatigue, spasms in the limbs, or general lack of energy may be seen by others but still take a toll. It hurts when friends or family dismiss her symptoms and think she’s “flaking” or “not taking the relationship seriously,” Morgan says.\nAs Green puts it, “Don't make someone with MS feel like they have to justify their disease to you.”\n“Fatigue is terrible, and so despite doing everything in my power to try and go to, say, a fun event with my friends, I come to that day and I just physically -- I can't do it,” Green says. “I'm used to that disappointment. It sucks.”\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms. It affects as many as 80% of people with MS, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Why it happens isn’t clear, but it can hamper your daily routine.\nWhile MS can sap you physically and mentally, its impact also extends to near and dear ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou're going to need to lean on [your family] when you get a diagnosis and to help you get through those difficult days. You just have to be honest with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor partners, “it’s difficult in different ways,” Green says. “They're not feeling what you're feeling and they want to support you, but there's no handbook for this.”\nWhat’s harder is feeling like you’re letting someone down all the time, Townsend says. “Even though, for the most part, my friends and family haven't made me feel like this, it makes you feel like a burden. You feel like you’re ruining everybody else's fun plans.”\nOpen communication and reassurance can go a long way. “I think that it’s important to always reassure them that they're not a burden,” Townsend says. “Reassure me that you see me.”\nKeep clear lines of communication with your family, Leak says. “You're going to need to lean on them when you get a diagnosis and to help you get through those difficult days. You just have to be honest with them.”\nMorgan says that she used to teach at a college but the demands became too much for her to handle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore About Multiple Sclerosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“They didn't understand the accommodations, for example, bladder and bowel issues -- I've had accidents teaching in the classroom and you just can't help it,” Morgan says. If you have MS, it’s common to use the bathroom more frequently or even lose control at times.\n“I would love, love for co-workers to understand I need accommodations. This is not easy,” Morgan says. “What I would wish for employers to understand that sometimes, I'm not ready for a meeting -- I don't want to talk. I don't because I'm tired.”\nNow, Morgan works from home. For her, given her unpredictable MS symptoms, this feels like the ideal situation.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act allows for reasonable accommodations in the workplace. You may need to work with your supervisor and HR office on that if you have MS.\nSome people with MS live symptom-free for long periods of time. Others with severe MS symptoms may need special accommodations just to go out to a restaurant, especially if they have physical limitations.\n“If we're going somewhere that doesn't have an elevator [and] has a bunch of stairs, that's not going to work for me,” Townsend says. “It’s really about being conscious of those things.”\nWith MS, it’s common to have balance or movement issues. Mobility aids can help you stay independent, adapt, and get around.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome people find it hard to get over the negative stigma of using mobility aids.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“If you do use a cane or need to use a wheelchair, or you're using the scooter at Target or Costco or whatever, that is nothing to be ashamed of.

{"title": "Many Parents Struggling to Find COVID Shots for Kids", "date": "2023-09-26 16:33:46", "text": "Oct. 5, 2023 – COVID vaccines are scarce, but the challenges that parents face in finding shots for their children make the hunt even more complex.\nThere are doses specific for children, and kids can’t get the shots in pharmacies in many states because pharmacists aren’t allowed to vaccinate them, depending on their age. Parents across the country have reported not being able to get their kids vaccinated.\nWhen the CDC announced its recommendation in September that all people ages 6 months and older get the new seasonal shot, the agency noted that 600 children had died from COVID-19 since May, adding that the risks of severe complications, like a widely publicized heart problem, were much more common due to getting COVID-19 itself, compared to getting vaccinated.\nThe search for a vaccine is unfamiliar for many parents. In prior years of the pandemic, parents often got their children vaccinated against COVID-19 at pop-up clinics, many of which set up in the parking lots of schools. But this year, those pop-up clinics are scarce. This is the first vaccination campaign without the resources of a declared federal health emergency, which ended in May.\nFive pharmacies in the Washington, D.C., area told parent Kevin Goldberg recently that they don’t yet have the new version of the COVID-19 vaccines for children.\n“Two CVSs near us and the Safeway we usually use told us that they don't have the kids' doses -- but they were having enough trouble getting shots in adult arms,” said Goldberg, who plans to get his 5-year-old son, Milo, vaccinated. “The local, privately-owned pharmacy we used said they expect to have them in next week and suggested we check back over the weekend to see if we can schedule him.”\nThere has been dwindling demand for kids’ COVID vaccines. The CDC says about 32 million people age 18 and younger have gotten at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according to the CDC COVID Data Tracker, which reports vaccinations through May. But the bivalent booster that came out last fall was administered to just 3.5 million people under 18 years old. Demand for young children was especially low: Just 125,801 kids ages 5 years or younger got the bivalent booster.\n“Oddly, I'm not worried yet,” said Goldberg, an attorney. “I'd obviously like to get him the booster and his flu shot but there's not a whole lot I can do right now.\nThe lack of supply is especially frustrating as the CDC has strongly recommended children get not just the COVID vaccine, but a flu shot, too. \nThe new recommendations are that children 5 and older receive at least one dose of the updated Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and those 6 months to 4 years get two doses of either vaccine (with one of the doses being the updated shot).\nThis year’s jabs are slightly different from prior COVID vaccines. Not only do they target a specific mutation of the virus called XBB.1.5 and its related variants, but they are also expected to provide protection against strains linked to an uptick in cases and hospitalizations over the summer. \nStill, more than half of U.S. children between the ages of 6 months and 17 years have not received a first COVID-19 shot, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. What’s more, concerns – often misguided-- about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines and the potential for long-term side effects in children and adolescents – like an inflamed heart muscle (myocarditis) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C, a severe immune response that affects multiple organs) – continue to impact parents’ and caregivers’ choice whether to vaccinate their children or not. \nDespite those concerns, research has found that the risk of myocarditis is much higher in children who develop COVID than in those who are vaccinated against it. It has also mostly occurred in boys. MIS-C in children after COVID vaccination is also extremely rare, and research shows those who develop it may have a specific genetic marker making them more susceptible. \nYet some parents remain skeptical.\n“I’ve seen the articles, especially in boys about the heart issue stuff, and that’s terrifying to me especially because my boys are super active,” said Sarah Weaver, a 40 year-old mother of three and high school English teacher in the Detroit metro area. \n“I’m not a risk taker. The risk of what could happen if they got [COVID] seems to outweigh the risks [of vaccination] because kids were not seriously affected for the most part.”\nBut experts point out that COVID is now one of the top causes of pediatric deaths and that most deaths have come in children with no preexisting medical condition. \nIs Myocarditis Still a Concern?\nEarly in the pandemic, questions over vaccine safety increased as researchers started to track reports linking the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to myocarditis in young adult males and adolescents, mostly after the second dose. \nSince that time, however, the CDC’s surveillance efforts have demonstrated a significant decline in these cases.\n\"It seems that the risk was highest after that second dose of the initial series and we’re not seeing it at this point,” said Sean O’Leary, MD, professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital, Colorado, and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases.\n\"We’re not anticipating with the new booster that MIS-C is going to come back based on what we’ve seen in the past year and a half,\" he said.\nShelby Kutty MD, PhD, director of pediatric and congenital cardiology and professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, agreed.\n\"There were substantially more patients in the first wave than in recent times; frequency has come down overall,\" he said. \nBut Kutty also had an important message for parents and caregivers.\n\"When we talk about myocarditis, we think about a very scary infection of the heart and complications. ... But it is not a new disease; it can happen with different viral infections,\" he said.\n\"Most of the reported [vaccine-related] cases overall were clinically mild and most people recovered in 3 to 5 days with no other problems after that. They just required supportive treatment -- like anti-inflammatory drugs -- and almost 90% had resolution of symptoms when they were discharged from the hospital,\" he said.\nIn contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been and continues to be associated with \"a substantially increased risk of myocarditis, other heart rhythm problems, pericarditis [inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart], and increased risk of hospitalizations and death,\" he said, also emphasizing that \"the actual infection is increased by nearly 10- or 11-fold if the person is not vaccinated.\" \nWhat About MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome)?\nAnother concern that arose early in the pandemic (and remains top of mind among many parents) is MIS-C, a condition that mimics Kawasaki disease and mostly occurs in young children, causing the blood vessels to become inflamed. Initially, most MIS-C cases developed 2 to 4 weeks after infection with COVID. Since that time, cases have followed the peaks of overall COVID-19 infection cases by about a month.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParents want to keep their kids healthy; they want to keep their kids safe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRobert W. Frenck Jr., MD, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio, explained that MIS-C is basically an overexuberant immune response. \n\"You get fevers, you get conjunctivitis, enlarged lymph nodes, rash, etc. But if you look at the rate and severity of MIS-C from the infection versus the rate and severity from the vaccine, it’s about 7 to 8 times higher,\" he said. \nThus far, rates with both previous bivalent mRNA vaccines continue to be quite low, according to CDC data.\nPediatric COVID in Perspective\nThe flurry of information and headlines and numbers since the start of the pandemic has overwhelmed many parents and caregivers who, like Weaver, only want what is best for their children. \n\"Parents want to keep their kids healthy; they want to keep their kids safe,\" said Frenck. \"They’re weighing the evidence and saying, 'I don’t think that it’s important to vaccinate my child, it’s a mild disease, the risk is low.' The problem is that I have no way to know if it’s their child or that child or the other child who’s going to have severe disease.\"\nBoth he and O’Leary said not only is COVID now one of the top 10 causes of pediatric deaths, but more than half of COVID-related deaths in children have occurred in children with no underlying or preexisting medical conditions, meaning that they were preventable had these kids been vaccinated.\n\"You know, when you look at the lists of causes of deaths in kids like cancer and motor vehicle accidents and suicide, if we had a safe, simple, effective intervention to eliminate any of those, we’d jump at it, right?\" said O'Leary. \n\"We have that in this case, in the vaccine.

{"title": "How to Manage Depression Triggers", "date": "2023-09-26 16:51:45", "text": "Stress can take a toll on anyone. But if you have depression, you might not bounce back from stress easily. The death of a loved one, a job loss, or a divorce could trigger symptoms such as guilt and hopelessness. But there are steps you can take to get better.\n“You need to see that you’re about to go down the rabbit hole, and take a step back,” says Jeannie Lochhead, MD, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine. “Meditation, mindfulness, good sleep, avoiding alcohol, spending time with people who actually care about you -- that’s what builds resilience. It’s not push, push, push. Try harder.”\nYou can manage your depression, no matter what causes it. Here are some common triggers and expert tips on how to take action to reduce their impact on you.\nYou might have a lot tied up in your work. For starters, a job loss can take you away from an entire network of people. “That alone causes social isolation, which can cause depression,” Lochhead says.\nAdvice: Try to gain some control of the situation, says Tim Pearman, PhD, a professor of medical social sciences and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\nPearman suggests you update your resume but stay flexible. “There may be a whole bunch of job opportunities available to you that you might not even think about outside of your field,” he says. “Maybe it’s time to break the mold of how you self-identify in terms of your career path and consider other options.” Casting a wider net in your job search may help you feel more in control and less hamstrung by the recent job loss.\nNo one likes to feel unwanted. But rejection, whether from a potential employer, a friend, or a significant other, can spark depression in some people. That includes those with rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD).\nAdvice: Use a technique called benefit-finding. “The idea is basically finding silver linings,” says Kate Sweeny, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside.\nSweeny studies strategies that help people get through stressful or uncertain times. She says people tend to feel less depressed when they think about positive things that might come out of bad news, such as the loss of a job or relationship.\nThe end of a relationship is hard, whether you live with depression or not. That’s true whether you’re the one who decides to leave or not. “It’s going to be a bumpy ride,” Lochhead says. “People need to expect that. Even if they’re the ones who decide they want the divorce.”\nAdvice: It’s important to plan for your future and feel hopeful about it. To do that, Lochhead suggests you look to the things in your life that fulfill you most. And don’t pull away from your loved ones. “Avoiding social isolation is really important after divorce,” she says.\nA marriage and family counselor can be a big help. Pearman says a couple’s therapist can help you decide to stay together or “make the splitting-up process as non-traumatic as possible.”\nAll families have their ups and downs. But you don’t have to push through and fix your problems on your own.\nAdvice: As a parent, you have lots of outlets. Pearman says to reach out to a family counselor, peer group, or friends and family. The same is true for children and teens. “Kids who do the best, in terms of their emotional health, are the ones who have a really strong social network.”\nPearman suggests you head off family problems at the pass. Check in with your kids every week. Ask them about school, friends, and their likes and dislikes. “It can be in the context of something fun, like going out for ice cream or taking a walk,” he says. “But if your child knows you’re going to have that time, it can really open the door for them to be a little more communicative.”\nIt’s normal to feel sad after you lose someone close to you. But depression and grief aren’t the same thing. “Active grief tends to be a little bit more dramatic. It’s crying spells and not being able to focus on anything because you’re so torn apart by it,” Pearman says. “With depression, a lot of what people experience is a sense of numbness.”\nAdvice: Pay attention to your symptoms. If you can’t focus on your work or get out of bed, or you’ve been depressed for more than a few months, “at that point, it’s probably time to seek professional help,” Pearman says.\nYou can seek grief counseling before or after your loss. A counselor can help you work through strong emotions. Also, give yourself a break if you think you’re “not grieving right.” Don’t beat yourself up for grieving for too long or feeling too sad or not sad enough. “It’s not a linear process,” he says.\nThe anniversary of a loss can also be tough. It can help if you plan something for that day. “That can be as simple as having a moment to reflect on what that person meant in your life,” Pearman says. “Or it can be as big a thing as getting family or friends together to talk about that person.”\nIt’s normal to feel uncertain and lonely when your kids leave home. It’s a major change.\nAdvice: Lochhead almost always suggests mindfulness meditation for soon-to-be empty nesters. It’s OK to be upset for a little while. But, she says, you need to focus more on “accepting the change that’s about to happen and letting the thoughts go.”\nPearman thinks it’s a good idea to volunteer or take a course to learn something new. This can help fill that newfound time and space with something that brings you joy.\nYour daily routine changes a lot when you don’t go to work every day. That can raise your risk for depression triggers such as social isolation, bad sleep habits, and lack of physical activity.\nWithout a job, your days can feel as if they lose their structure. This can open your time up to all kinds of bad habits if you’re prone to them. For example, Lochhead says, “You’re more likely to drink alcohol. If you usually drink only on the weekends, now you can drink Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.”\nAdvice: Try to figure out what it is about retirement that might trigger depression. Then learn how to manage those cues. Lochhead says it’s all about planning. For example, do you feel low without a routine and a full social calendar? If so, create your own schedule and meetups with friends.\nAs with empty nest syndrome, Pearman suggests you volunteer or take a class. But he says it’s also the perfect time to get active. “Try a bunch of different things,” he says. “And if one kind of exercise doesn’t speak to you, try something else.”\nDepression can sometimes be a symptom of an ongoing illness. It’s easy to get mentally or physically overwhelmed if you’re sick or care for a loved one who’s ill.\nAdvice: You might get the message that you need to stay positive. But it’s natural to feel bad when bad things happen, Pearman says. “Let yourself feel that.”\nBut more importantly, he says, is that you ask for help. Be specific. Maybe you need meals a couple of times a week. Or perhaps you want someone to stay with your loved one while you go to the gym. Don’t worry about being a burden. Friends and family usually want to help. Pearman says it can actually “be a gift” if you tell them exactly what you need.\nThe holidays can be a time for celebration with friends and family. But all that activity can be hard to handle. The holidays often trigger depression for people. The stress of the holidays can lead to anxiety, too. “If you have social anxiety, going to a holiday party may actually be incredibly stress-inducing,” Lochhead says.\nAdvice: It’s healthy to limit the time you spend with certain people. That includes family members, friends, or co-workers. And don’t feel bad about it. “Realize your own need for space and [figure out] how you can get that,” Pearman says.\nBut if you do start to notice unhealthy thoughts or behaviors, “that’s where mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful,” Lochhead says.\nThe holidays can also throw you off your otherwise healthy routine. Keep an eye on your holiday sleep habits, eating patterns, physical activity, and alcohol intake. “All of those things impact depression relapses,” she says.\nMany people have new or worse depression when the seasons change. That’s called seasonal affective disorder (SAD).\nAdvice: Talk to your doctor. They might suggest light exposure, talk therapy, or antidepressants. Physical activity can also help. “Exercise is the number one most important strategy,” Pearman says. “It really can turn things around.”\nWrite down your feelings as they happen. You might see that you’re more depressed in the morning or as the day goes on. “It’s really important to notice those patterns, because then, you can actually plan for when you need to get things done,” he says.\nCertain hormonal shifts can affect your mood. For women, that includes before the start of your period and during or after pregnancy or menopause. “It can be overwhelming to feel like your emotions aren’t in your control,” Lochhead says\nAdvice: No matter the cause, hormonal changes can bring serious symptoms that affect your daily life. Lochhead suggests you ask your doctor about medication or other treatments that can help you feel better.\nIf you get premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), plan for your symptoms. “Set an alarm 4 days before your cycle that says, ‘Hey, warning, for the next 4 days, you’re going to feel things much more intensely,’” Lochhead says.\nPeople with depression are more likely to use drugs and alcohol. On the flip side, a substance use disorder (SUD) can worsen your low mood and other symptoms. This is what Pearman calls a “circular relationship.”\nAdvice: Keep track of your substance use. “People who regularly overuse alcohol, or who’ve had any problems with addiction in the past, should make sure to keep a record of their drinking to ensure that it is staying within the limits they set and not increasing over time,” Pearman says.\nSeek professional help if you can’t control your drug or alcohol use. Pearman suggests a certified alcohol drug counselor (CADC). They’ll help you manage your depression and your substance use.\nSOURCES:\nJeannie Lochhead, MD, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry, University of California, Riverside School of Medicine.\nTim Pearman, PhD, professor of medical social sciences and psychiatry and behavioral sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; director of supportive oncology, Robert H.

{"title": "The Link Between Stress and Depression", "date": "2023-09-26 16:56:09", "text": "When you think of stress, it probably brings negative emotions to mind. But some stress is good for you, like the anticipation you feel when you start a new relationship or job. It can fuel excitement and make you want to do and achieve more. Stress can also help you be prepared to face challenges or respond to dangerous situations.\nGood stress doesn’t stick around. It boosts your mood to meet the moment, then goes away. If you’re under stress for long periods of time, it can become overwhelming and affect you both physically and emotionally.\n“Our stress response does pretty good in the short term, but it doesn’t do very good if you activate it in the long term,” says David Prescott, PhD, associate professor of Health Administration and Public Health at Husson University in Bangor, ME.\n“If we stay under chronic stress, our physiological stress response is taxed beyond what it’s designed to do, and it starts to impair us.”\nThe effects of chronic, or long-term, stress can be harmful on their own, but they also can contribute to depression, a mood disorder that makes you feel sad and disinterested in things you usually enjoy. Depression can affect your appetite, your sleep habits, and your ability to concentrate.\nAnd the effects of depression can cause stress.\n“The impact of stress on depression, and vice versa, is one of the most important problems of our times,” says Carol Landau, PhD, clinical professor at Brown University.\n“We think that the causal relationship between stress and depression is what’s called ‘bidirectional,’” Prescott says. “One can cause the other, and the other can cause the first, and both can make each other worse.”\nThe ways depression can lead to stress are pretty clear.\n“Depression disrupts your life, so you often are more isolated,” Prescott says. “Sometimes you shrink your interpersonal network and stop doing a lot of activities, like work or school or things that you enjoy. We know that kind of isolation makes your perceived stress level go up, so we know that depression can cause stress.”\nThere’s good evidence that the reverse is true as well.\n“A severe stress, like a divorce or a huge financial change, is a major stressor, and it sends the psyche sort of out of equilibrium. If you keep raising levels of stress, something’s going to happen, and often it is depression,” Landau says.\nBut the reasons stress contributes to depression are less obvious.\n“It’s pretty clear that chronic stress raises the incidence level of depression,” Prescott says. According to The Mental Health Survey Report from The Mental Health Institution, levels of depression among members of Gen Z went up about 4% or 5% between pre- and post-pandemic.\n“We think the social isolation, the disruption in normal activities, and the general stress of having your college or work disrupted appeared to increase levels of depression. But I would say we don’t know, causally, exactly how that happened.”\nSometimes a few small changes can break the stress-depression cycle, beginning with a more positive mindset.\n“If you’re stressed and feel like you’re starting to become depressed, the biggest thing is to get a little more active coping strategy in the way you’re going to deal with your stress,” Prescott says. “Don’t just think that you’re going to have to ‘suck it up and take it.’\"\nA more active coping strategy can include:\n“If you’re depressed and you’re trying to minimize the impact of stress on your life, it’s important to overcome that belief that ‘nothing I do is really going to matter,’” Prescott says. “It’s just not true in most cases. It may not change everything, but it’s a big thing to overcome that kind of hopeless belief.”\nAnother way to ease the effects of stress and depression is to not try to handle them alone. Strong, supportive relationships can make a big difference.\n“Depression is a state of disconnection,” Landau says. “So one of the most important things would be to find a way to connect. Adding a couple of people who you’ve known from the past and finding a way to connect is extremely important.”\nTalking with friends and family can help you better understand what’s causing your stress, which can be a big step forward.\n“If stress and depression are playing off each other, it can help to kind of articulate and pinpoint the stressors in your life that are causing the most impairment,” Prescott says. “We ultimately all feel ‘I’m stressed,’ in general, but it’s really helpful to sort of pinpoint down what specific things are getting to you.\n“It’s helpful to have someone say things like, ‘How are you doing dealing with your stress?’ or ‘Tell me about how your mood is holding up?’ or ‘How are your spirits?’ Then just listen.\n“A lot of times, what helps people is not specific advice like, ‘Do this or do that,’ but just a chance to talk it out with somebody who pays attention. Ask an open-ended question like that and then bite your bottom lip and listen for a while.”\nIf talking to friends or family doesn’t work well enough, you can talk with a professional. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one way to change your perspective and approach.\n“Cognitive behavior therapy is important because we want to be able to get control back,” Landau says. “CBT helps you focus on what small thing you can accomplish today, how you can implement it, how you can evaluate it. So it’s a great educational tool as well as a therapy tool.”\nSOURCES: \nDavid Prescott, PhD, associate professor in Health Administration and Public Health, Husson University, Bangor, ME. \nCarol Landau, PhD, consulting psychologist, author, and clinical professor, Brown University, Providence, RI. \nBritish Psychological Society: “Stress: the good, the bad and the ugly.” \nAnxiety & Depression Association of America: “Depression.” \nMental Health America: “The State of Mental Health in America.” \nNational Institute of Health: “Stress and Depression: Preclinical Research and Clinical Implications,” “The Effects of Psychological Stress on Depression.”  \nMayo Clinic: “Stress Management.” \nAnxiety & Depression Association of America: “Exercise for Stress and Anxiety.”\nCleveland Clinic: “Stress: 10 Ways to Ease Stress.” \nUniversity of Michigan Health: “Healthy Eating to Decrease Stress.” \nMental Health Foundation: “Smoking and Mental Health.” \nAmerican Psychological Association: “Sleep and Stress.” \nAmerican Psychiatric Association: “What Is Depression?” \nSleep Foundation: “Stress and Insomnia.” \nDifferences between feeling depressed and feeling blue.\nFamous people who've struggled with persistent sadness.\nLearn the truth about this serious illness.\nTips to stay the treatment course.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "How Long Should You Take Antidepressants?", "date": "2023-09-26 16:59:23", "text": "If you start to feel better while taking antidepressants, you may wonder how long you should take this medication or whether you can stop.\nExpert guidelines about antidepressants can be confusing. They depend on a variety of factors, including:\nWhether it’s a good idea to stop depends on you.\n“We know that taking antidepressants for too short a time might pose real risks for some people, but for others, taking them for longer could be more than you need,” says David Baron, a psychiatrist and provost of the Western University of Health Sciences in California.\n“This decision needs to be made with a professional, just as a patient who takes insulin or chemotherapy would have specific discussions with their specialist,” he says. “Antidepressants can and do work, but they should be used like any other medication.”\nIf you and your doctor decide it’s time to stop, you’ll need to know the best way to do it and how to avoid possible side effects.\nUnder American Psychiatric Association guidelines, if you are taking an antidepressant for your first depressive episode, you should stay on it for at least 4 or 5 months after your symptoms of depression stop. Keep in mind that you may need to try several different antidepressants to find the right option for you, and even then, it can take 2 or 3 weeks to see an initial improvement. After that, it can take 3 to 6 months for symptoms to improve to the point that you are no longer depressed. Altogether, this could mean taking a prescription for about a year to get the full benefits.\nIf you have ongoing major depressive disorder, or you have had three or more depressive episodes, the APA recommends treatment for at least a few years. Doctors may also recommend longer treatment when the risk of relapse is high.\nThis can depend on a few factors including your:\n“Decide with your doctor what you expect to gain and improve from taking medication,” Baron says. “Poor sleep, low energy and low self-esteem symptoms might respond to medication, but antidepressants don’t take care of relationship problems.”\nIf you decide to stop taking antidepressants, don’t quit taking them on your own. And don’t stop all at once. A major drop in medication levels can trigger a relapse or other harmful symptoms, such as suicidal thoughts.\nWork with your doctor to create a plan to gradually reduce your medication dose over time. Every antidepressant enters and exits the body at a different speed. It may take several weeks to decrease medication levels safely. During this process, you should schedule regular follow-ups so your doctor can closely monitor you for any side effects or signs of relapse.\nYou may also want to schedule sessions with a therapist to deal with other life issues, such as grief, low self-esteem, or negative thinking that may control your mood.\n“Cognitive therapy can help people reexamine the accuracy of their negative beliefs, which can relieve their distress,” says Steven Hollon, a professor of psychiatry who researches the prevention and treatment of depression at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\nConsider your daily routine, too. Healthy lifestyle habits, such as proper sleep, good nutrition, regular physical activity, and stress reduction techniques, can help your body adjust to the changing medication levels.\nSome people report side effects or noticeable changes when they lower their antidepressant dose. Common complaints include:\nKeep track of any symptoms you have and discuss them with your doctor. They may be able to further tweak your dose to reduce the discomfort or prescribe something else to relieve the symptoms.\nIf you quit taking antidepressants suddenly, you may get “antidepressant discontinuation syndrome,” especially if you’ve been taking medication for more than a month or two. Symptoms can include:\nIt’s important to talk to your doctor about these symptoms to avoid a relapse and to find the right solution to ease symptoms as your body adjusts.\nSOURCES:\nDavid Baron, DO, Provost, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA.\nSteven Hollon, Professor of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.\nAmerican Psychiatric Association: “Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.”\nDifferences between feeling depressed and feeling blue.\nFamous people who've struggled with persistent sadness.\nLearn the truth about this serious illness.\nTips to stay the treatment course.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Depression Treatment Is Different for Everyone", "date": "2023-09-26 17:01:07", "text": "Depression is a mood disorder marked by feelings of sadness and a loss of interest in things you usually enjoy doing. You might also have a hard time thinking or getting things done, among other symptoms. Thoughts of suicide are possible in more severe cases.\nThe good news? There are lots of ways to treat depression and get you back to your best self. Here’s what you need to know.\nA diagnosis of depression is different from feeling down one day or being in a crappy mood for a few days. These are normal reactions if you lose your job, a loved one dies, or something else happens. But with major depression disorder (MDD), chemicals in your brain don’t always work the way they’re supposed to. Other things, like genetics, sometimes play a role. So you feel this way for a much longer period of time -- typically 2 or more weeks.\nDavid A. Adler, MD, a senior psychiatrist and director of the Mental Health Services Research Group at Tufts Medical Center, says that 50% of people diagnosed with MDD will have a second episode of depression. And if you’ve had two episodes, there’s a 75% chance it’ll happen a third time, and then a 95% chance of a fourth.\nDepression can come on by itself or be triggered by a life event. There are different kinds, some of which include:\nMajor depression disorder (MDD). This is considered the classic type. It includes common symptoms like loss of interest in hobbies, trouble sleeping, and more.\nPersistent depressive disorder. This lasts for at least 2 years, but it may not be as intense as major depression. It used to be called dysthymia.\nPostpartum depression. This type of depression happens after giving birth.\nSeasonal affective disorder. This can happen as the seasons change and the days get shorter. Experts think it may have something to do with not getting enough sunlight, among other things.\nBipolar disorder. If you have this condition, you may get depressed but also have periods of really high or intense energy levels.\nTreatment depends on the person. What worked for a friend or family member may not work for you. And just because they had certain side effects doesn’t mean that’ll happen to you. For example, just because a certain antidepressant triggered weight gain in your mom doesn’t mean the same thing will happen to you. It’s important to approach treatment with an open mind.\nOptions include:\nPsychotherapy. Also called talk therapy, this involves meeting with a mental health professional in person or virtually to talk about and work through your feelings. It “helps the person optimize their coping strategies to deal with life’s stressors,” says James Murrough, MD, PhD, director of the Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai.\nAntidepressants. These are prescription medications that help balance brain chemicals.\nBrain stimulation therapies. This is when doctors use electrical pulses in hopes of changing brain activity. It’s an option for people who don’t respond to psychotherapy or antidepressants.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This is used for severe depression. Unlike brain stimulation therapies, your doctor puts you to sleep during the procedure. They send electrical currents through the brain to cause a short seizure. This seems to ease symptoms of some mental health conditions.\nMurrough says talk therapy and medication are equally likely to be effective in treating a person with MDD. John Greden, MD, founder of the Eisenberg Family Depression Center in Michigan, says he believes people with MDD who receive both psychotherapy and antidepressants fare better.\n“It shouldn’t be [psychotherapy] versus [antidepressants],” Greden says.\nIt’s important to talk with your doctor honestly about what’s going on so they can help you decide what might work best. It may take a few tries, but you’ll figure it out together.\n“The best evidenced-based treatments follow an individual’s preference, since both medication therapy and the psychotherapies have demonstrated good outcomes,” Adler says.\nThese also depend on the person. Some people have zero side effects, while others have to try a few antidepressants before they find one whose side effects they can handle.\nThe older class of traditional antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or MAOIs) were known to cause significant weight gain or lower your sex drive. They worked, but people tend to choose the newer ones that have better “side effect profiles,” Greden says\nIt’s hard to get good data on how lifestyle changes can help manage depression, says Murrough, but “exercise has been shown to have antidepressant effects.”\nHe says there’s also evidence to suggest that stress management, whether through meditation or other mindfulness practices, is helpful.\nResearchers are also looking into ketamine for treating severe depression.\nIf you’re having suicidal thoughts or feelings of self-harm, know that you’re not alone. There are resources and people that can help. Reach out to your doctor, a family member, or friend. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Helpline at 800-662-4357.\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Psychiatry Association: “What is Depression?”\nDavid A.

{"title": "Depression: Finding What Works for You", "date": "2023-09-26 17:03:09", "text": "\nFor many people, treating depression isn't as simple as popping a pill. For about half of people with depression, the first medication they try isn't the right fit. Even an antidepressant that works to relieve symptoms could cause unpleasant side effects like drowsiness, nausea, weight gain, or problems with your sex drive.\nYou might need to change drugs or change doses -- maybe more than once. Your doctor could have you try a combination of medications. If you're not already doing talk therapy, they may suggest you add it to the mix. Therapy and antidepressants work about equally well to relieve depression symptoms.\nYour doctor needs to monitor this process closely. It takes time and patience. And patience isn't easy when you're still having depression symptoms or dealing with medication side effects. But it pays off when you and your doctor zero in on the treatment that's right for you.\nChoosing an antidepressant is more nuanced than you might think.\n\"Everyone is unique,\" says Michelle Riba, MD, clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan. \"Just picking a medication off the shelf won't do it. … You have to do a really good evaluation and medical examination and look at the medical history.\"\nBefore prescribing one, your doctor will ask a lot of questions. One might be what antidepressants you or other family members with depression have taken before, and how well they worked. The answer could predict how you'll respond to the same drug or drugs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEveryone is unique. Just picking a medication off the shelf won't do it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThey'll also consider other medical and mental health conditions (bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety) you may have. For example, your doctor might avoid selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if you have a bleeding disorder. This type of antidepressant slightly increases your risk for bleeding.\n\"And if you've got bipolar disorder, you shouldn't take an antidepressant by itself,\" says Michael E. Thase, MD, chief of the Mood and Anxiety Section and professor of psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania. \"You'd want to take a mood stabilizer first.\"\nYour doctor will also consider any other medications you're taking, to avoid interactions. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, they'll avoid drugs that aren’t safe for you.\nWhen you start on a new antidepressant, your doctor will check in at regular intervals to ask how you feel and whether you have any side effects. \"You're learning as you're going,\" Thase says.\nYou may need to take a new drug for up to 6 weeks to give it enough time to work. Side effects often go away over time, too.\nIf your symptoms are a little better but still there, your doctor might bump up the dose. Or they might put you on a different antidepressant in the same class, to see if it's a better match.\nBut if a particular drug didn't help or caused annoying side effects, your doctor will likely switch you to a different type. Your response to the previous medication helps your doctor choose which one you get next. \"If you had too many stomach side effects with an SSRI, your next choice of medicine would not be an SSRI,\" Thase says.\nSometimes, adding another type of medication to the antidepressant helps it work better. Another option is to add a newer antipsychotic drug to the mix. The upside is that the antipsychotics work quickly -- within a week or two. The downside is that they can cause more side effects than SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), Thase says.\nTreating depression isn't much different than treating a medical condition like high blood pressure. Not only might you need to try different medications and dosages, you also may need to make changes to your lifestyle to see an improvement.\n\"With high blood pressure you have to change your diet, exercise, and stop eating salt. You try medication and you may have to increase or change it. It takes time,\" Riba says.\nResearch shows that these lifestyle changes may help people with depression:\nYour genes offer important clues to help your doctor narrow down the search for the right antidepressant.\nNew genetic tests use a sample of DNA from your blood or saliva to predict how your body might respond to a certain type of drug. These tests can't tell you which antidepressant will definitely work for you. But they can give your doctor an idea of how your body processes certain drugs, or if a certain type of antidepressant might cause side effects for you.\nBut the tests can be expensive, costing up to $2,000. Some insurance companies will pay for genetic tests, but may want you to try a few antidepressants first. Most people don’t get this testing unless they're having trouble finding an effective treatment, Thase says.\nYou've got a 50-50 chance of finding the right antidepressant on the first try, Thase says. If that one doesn't work, there's about a 40% chance of getting it right the second time. Each time you switch to a new med, your odds of success drop slightly.\nWhen you're dealing with depression symptoms even after getting treatment, you may be tempted to stop the medication completely. But there are benefits to sticking with it. About 9 out of 10 people who stay on their depression treatment for a year eventually do feel better, Thase says.\nEach time a medication doesn't work, your doctor will dig into the reasons why.\n\"Sometimes there's a point at which you have to go back and ask, 'Is this the right diagnosis? Are we missing something?'\" Riba says.\nIf your depression is stubborn, it may be time to rethink your treatment plan. Your doctor could try a different type of treatment, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or ketamine.\nIn TMS, doctors use an electromagnet to stimulate nerve cells in certain areas of your brain. These regions of your brain are thought to have less activity when you have depression. Scientists aren't sure exactly how TMS works, but it can ease depression symptoms.\nECT is a procedure in which a doctor sends low-voltage electric currents through your brain, causing a brief seizure. This causes brain changes that relieve symptoms for some people. Ketamine is an anesthetic, once known as a club drug, that doctors can prescribe for treatment-resistant depression.\n\"The most important thing is to collaborate and be open and willing to learn from your experiences,\" Thase says. \"Your chances of being on the good side of the 50-50 really do go up.\"\nOnce you get on the right medicine and dose, follow your doctor's directions for taking it. And stay on it for as long as your doctor recommends. Depression is a chronic condition, and it can come back if you stop treatment too soon.\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Psychological Association: \"Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Depression Across Three Age Cohorts.\"\nHarvard Medical School: \"What are the real risks of antidepressants?\"\nInformedHealth.org: \"Depression: How Effective Are Antidepressants?\"\nMichael E.

{"title": "Robots Are Taking Over Your Surgery (and You Should Be Excited)", "date": "2023-09-26 18:41:05", "text": "Sept. 26, 2023 – On her flight to Atlanta, Robin Pollack nibbled gummy bears and sipped a cranberry juice cocktail. It had been a week since she'd gotten robotic surgery to remove a cancerous stomach tumor at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and she was heading home – feeling surprisingly good.\nThe surgery required five small cuts. “I now have four little dots and a 2-inch slit that he superglued shut,” Pollack said. “After surgery, I woke up hungry.”\nShe was out of bed and walking in a day, and out and about town with her husband within a week, enjoying crème brûlée and eggs Florentine.\n“I have not had one bit of pain since,” she said 2 weeks after surgery. “I have not taken pain medication, not even one Tylenol. I walked 2 miles yesterday.”\nA better post-operative quality of life is one perk of robotic surgery, said surgical oncologist Naruhiko Ikoma, MD, who performed Pollack’s procedure. \nThere are pluses for the surgeon, as well. “I feel more precise in terms of dissection and in suturing,” said Ikoma. “In conventional open operations, surgeons use instruments. … In robotic surgery, surgeons feel like they’re operating with their own fingers with precise tips.”\nRobotic surgery, or robot-assisted surgery, is more than 20 years old, but experts believe it is now poised for growth. Propelling the technology forward are the very advantages that Pollack and Ikoma describe: improved accuracy, shorter recovery times, and less pain. \nAbout 644,000 robotic surgeries were performed in the United States in 2021, and that figure is expected to approach 1 million by 2028. Millions more have taken place worldwide. The global market hit $6.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $26.8 billion in 10 years.\nRobot-assisted devices are FDA-cleared across many specialties. For prostate removals and hysterectomies, the use of surgical robots is now more common than not. It’s also rapidly growing in bariatric surgery and hernia repair, and has increased steadily in hip and knee replacements. Several surgical teams have pioneered robot-assisted kidney transplants, and recently the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis reported the first robotic liver transplant in the U.S.\nThe most widely used robotic system in the U.S. is Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci. The FDA first approved a da Vinci in 2000 and has cleared newer models since then. Today, more than 7,500 da Vinci surgical systems are in use in 69 countries across six continents. \nDozens of other companies have entered the game. Advances in materials science are driving soft, flexible designs that can navigate winding pathways or operate on some of the body’s most delicate tissues. \nAuris Health’s Monarch, a flexible robotic endoscopic system, enters through the mouth into the trachea and bronchial passages to examine potentially cancerous tissue in the lungs. The platform recently earned a urological clearance for kidney stone removal. Other flexible robots enter the rectum and travel through intestines, as for colonoscopy. Still others snake through the nose to reach the brain, or the thigh’s femoral vein to get to the heart. \nAn upgrade of Stryker’s Mako robot, currently used for hip and knee replacements, will enable its use in spine and shoulder surgery and could launch as early as next year. (The doctors interviewed for this article are not promoting or endorsing any products mentioned.) \nMeanwhile, artificial intelligence, or AI, is letting researchers and developers make robots more autonomous, capable of performing surgical subtasks or even entire surgical procedures.\n“It is an exciting time,” said Michael Yip, PhD, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, and director of the Advanced Robotics and Controls Laboratory, at the University of California San Diego. “The diversity of robotic technologies is really widening exponentially.”\nBenefits for Patients\nData shows that robotic surgery can help reduce bleeding, scarring, and recovery time, and it allows for shorter hospital stays, compared to traditional surgery. \nOne of the most striking benefits: Many patients, like Pollack, do not need opioids – or any painkillers, for that matter. That’s remarkable when you consider the norm. \nFor kidney transplant, “it’s 100% narcotic use after an open transplant,” said Thomas Pshak, MD, a robotic kidney and liver transplant surgeon at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital. Open surgery patients go home with as much as a week’s supply of opioids, and sometimes need morphine or oxycodone in an IV after surgery.\nRobotic surgery patients heal much faster, returning to work and normal activities within a few weeks, vs. the recommended 8 weeks after open kidney transplant. \n“A painless kidney transplant seems like science fiction, but here we are,” Pshak said.\nHe uses a da Vinci surgical robot system with four slender arms, each about the size of a pencil, that hold surgical instruments and a high-definition camera. During surgery, he sits at a computer console a few feet away, looking through binoculars that provide a highly magnified 3D view of the operation site. With both hands on joystick-type controls, he guides the arms into the cuts to perform “delicate, precise movements,” such as suturing the new kidney to blood vessels. Foot pedals engage and disengage the robot arms. \nPshak performed UCHealth’s first robotic kidney transplant in 2021 and has done more than a dozen since then, and even more donor kidney removals, using the robot. With robotic kidney transplant, “the biggest incision is about 2 inches, near the bellybutton,” he said. For context, a traditional open kidney transplant involves a 10- to 12-inch cut.\nRobotics may improve access to surgery as well. One-third of patients waiting for a donated kidney have body mass indexes over 35. The higher BMI can mean longer, deeper cuts, increasing the risk of complications and negative outcomes. The less invasive robotic procedure could make kidney transplant possible for these patients.\nBenefits for Doctors\nIn a sense, robotics give surgeons superhuman skills. The robot can correct for any tremor in the surgeon’s hand and lets a surgeon view hard-to-see creases, moving the camera and small tools into places the human hand can’t reach.\n“I can set the [robot] arm movements to move at one-tenth of my normal hand movement,” Pshak said. “That just allows for some insane accuracy.”\nIn spinal surgery, robotics minimize the misplacement of a screw. That means “a lower revision rate – having to go back and remove and replace a misplaced screw,” said Mohamad Bydon, MD, a neurosurgeon and clinician-scientist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, where they’ve been performing robotic neurosurgeries since 2018.\nBydon was the lead author of a study in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that reported that out of 402 screws placed in 77 patients who had robot-assisted spinal surgery, none had to be redone after surgery.\nOther advantages, Bydon noted, include the ability to map out the surgery in advance, and sub-millimeter accuracy around a patient’s nerves and spinal cord. \"It preserves muscles, tendons, and ligaments,” he said.\nCorey Walker, MD, is a neurosurgeon at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles who performed minimally invasive robotic back surgery on a high school football player last year after the player fractured his spine in three spots. The robots collect data that is fed back into AI algorithms to improve planning and accuracy. “The robot is not just giving us a technical advantage,” Walker noted, “but also a data advantage.”\nAfter surgery, the football player was back to normal activities and training again within weeks instead of the usual 6 months.\nWith younger patients, Walker said, it’s important to preserve their longevity and avoid injury to the muscles surrounding the spine. Robotic procedures “leave as little of a footprint on the structure of the spine as possible.”\nRobotic Surgery: What Patients and Doctors Should Know\nIn the United States, academic medical institutions and hospitals have developed their own credentialing paths. Many robotic surgeons train in conventional surgical techniques and later move into robotic procedures, taking web-based and in-person courses with equipment manufacturers, practicing on sample tissues, in virtual reality simulations, and on inanimate objects (like picking up small items or peeling tape from a surface). \nSome surgeons and medical centers offer robotic training for those outside their institution. At the Ohio State University College of Medicine, interested surgeons from around the world can visit, observing existing and emerging robotic procedures for $500 a day. \n“The biggest challenge with robotics is that it is so automated, it sometimes takes away from the residents’ ability to learn the anatomy,” Walker said. “Our challenge is to still be able to teach residents the anatomy and to not become reliant on the technology.”\nPatients should look into a hospital’s history with robotics and ask how many procedures their institution and surgeon have performed, as Pollack did before her surgery. Not all surgeries are suitable for robotics; patients and surgeons should discuss pros and cons.\nChallenges\nRobotic surgery is not without controversy. A 2021 review of 50 randomized trials comparing robot-assisted surgeries with laparoscopy and/or open surgery for belly or pelvic surgery found little difference in outcomes. \nSome older studies suggest risks or potentially worse outcomes for some procedures. In 2018, a New England Journal of Medicine multicenter study led by MD Anderson Cancer Center researchers reported that, in women with early cervical cancer, laparoscopic or robotic minimally invasive radical hysterectomy was linked to lower rates of disease-free survival and overall survival, when compared to open abdominal radical hysterectomy. And in 2021, the FDA cautioned against robotically assisted surgical device use for mastectomy.\nStill, scores of other recent studies back up robot-assisted surgery’s benefits.\nOne drawback: It’s not available everywhere. \"You have to be at a place that is willing to invest in it and that believes in it as a technology,” Walker said. \nFor certain specialties, the high cost (the da Vinci’s price tag is reported to be $2 million) may not outweigh the return on investment, Yip said , stalling growth.\nAccording to Francis Sutter, DO, chief of cardiac surgery at Lankenau Medical Center, part of Main Line Health, and a longtime robotic surgeon, the number of robotic heart surgeries has fallen in the past 10 years. \n“There’s not a market for it,” he said. \"I hope there will be more interest from cardiac surgeons in the years ahead.”\nWhat’s Next?\nSemi-autonomous devices that perform surgical tasks – like holding a clamp in place or removing damaged tissues – could start to emerge clinically in the next 10 years, Yip said. \nLike a self-driving car, they use sensors to localize with respect to anatomy and map the environment.\nSomeday, we may see fully autonomous robots capable of performing an entire procedure. At Johns Hopkins last year, surgeons tested a new robotic technology called Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) that visualizes and plans its next surgical move almost in real time.

{"title": "Caring for Adult Children with Mental Illness: How to Help", "date": "2023-09-27 16:45:32", "text": "Sept. 27, 2023 -- George Kaufmann, an 81-year-old retiree from California, has been dealing with his son’s mental illness for close to 30 years.\nHis son, Patrick, 48, had his first psychotic episode at 19, Kaufmann said. He’d previously dealt with depression, suicidal ideation and drug use, ““but things came to a head at that point.”\nLike many people with severe mental illness, Patrick lacked insight into his condition. “Despite his dangerous behaviors, he didn’t realize he had any type of problem,” Kaufmann said. \nThe only way Kaufmann and his wife were able to get help for their son was by getting a court order to have him treated involuntarily. Patrick’s first experience with the mental health system was being dragged out of the house in handcuffs.\nThe difficulties the Kaufmanns’ have experienced is not unique. New research is showing that caring for a loved one with a mental illness exacts a tremendous toll. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDespite his dangerous behaviors, he didn’t realize he had any type of problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“Needless to say, this didn’t get his relationship with mental health providers off to a good start. What followed was a rocky period of about 8 to 10 years, where he had a series of involuntary hospitalizations because he was a threat to himself and others.” Kaufman said. \nDuring that time, Patrick was assigned to an intensive case management program called ACT (assertive community treatment). The program consists of psychiatrists, nurses, therapist, and case managers, who work as a team to provide holistic care. \nAlthough he attended the program, he usually refused to take medication unless the court ordered it. But the staff didn’t give up and eventually, Patrick decided to accept treatment. \nPatrick’s care team got him into a residential program for people with dual diagnosis (mental illness and substance abuse). After becoming clean, sober, and regularly taking his medications, he was able to start living independently. He got certified as a peer specialist, working as an employment counselor for youth with first-episode psychosis at the same provider where he’d received services.\n‘Exhausting’ Burden\nKaufmann described difficulties he and his wife faced dealing with an adult child with mental illness. “As parents and family members, we got frustrated. We didn’t know what to do,” he said. “We didn’t have experience dealing with mental illness. We repeatedly did stuff that didn’t work or made things worse.”\nKen Duckworth, MD, chief medical officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, agrees that being a caregiver to an adult child with mental illness is one of the most difficult things a parent can face. “Parents are confused and afraid,” he said.\nThe burden can be overwhelming, says Barbara S, a mother from New York whose 36-year-old daughter has bipolar disorder. Barbara’s daughter moved in with her after a manic episode and hospitalization, during which she lost her home, her employment, and most of her friends.\nBarbara, who asked that her name not be used to protect her daughter’s privacy, said, “I was enjoying the freedom that comes with having grown-up kids who left the nest. Now, I’m involved with day-to-day details of my daughter’s life, as if she were a younger child—like medical appointments, safety planning, and helping her find work—while trying to juggle my own work so I can keep a roof over our heads. It’s exhausting.”\nA recent study evaluates the impact on the mental health and quality of life of family members who care for a mentally ill person at home. Researchers in Lebanon studied 600 caregivers who completed a questionnaire about their quality of life and wellbeing.\nCaregivers of family members with mental illness had higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and work fatigue as well as lower quality of life, compared to caregivers of family members without mental illness. \nThe researchers note that their findings align with those of previous studies suggesting that caregivers of family members with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dementia experience more stresses, anxiety, and depression, compared to caregivers of people with other chronic illnesses.\n‘You Are Not Alone’\nOne of the most common feelings that parents of adult children with mental illness face is the sense that no one understands what they’re going through, Duckworth said. They feel lost, not knowing where to turn for practical and emotional support.\nTo address these concerns, Duckworth wrote the book, You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health—With Advice from Experts and Wisdom from Real Individuals and Families. The book encompasses a spectrum of mental illness-related topics, including diagnoses, navigating the health care system, insurance questions, co-occurring substance abuse, suicide, and helping family members who don’t believe they need help. Beyond professional advice from experts, it contains first-person accounts of 130 people with mental illness who shared their stories. \nDuckworth encourages parents to attend the National Alliance on Mental Illness Family-to-Family program — an 8-week group run by family members of people with mental illness — which offers education about topics such as effective communication, self-care, compassionate support of one’s family member, and locating resources. People can share what they’re going through and find emotional support.\nKaufmann, whose story was told in the book You Are Not Alone, went to his first meeting of the group 25 years ago.\n“We had no idea there’s a whole community of people out there who’ve had similar experiences,” he said. “In the meeting, we made statements we thought people would regard as strange or off-putting about our son and our reactions to his illness. Instead, people said, ‘Yeah, we went through the same thing’ and shared how they dealt with it.” Now, Kaufmann is a certified teacher of Family-to-Family classes.\nNo One-Size-Fits-All Approach\n“There’s no one-size-fits-all,” Duckworth said. Strategies that work for one patient or family may not work for another. \nFor example, one of the most challenging aspects of dealing with mental illness in loved ones is lack of awareness on their part that they’re ill. Patrick is an example. “He thought he was fine and we, his parents, were the ‘crazy’ ones,” Kaufmann said.\nThis condition, called anosognosia, affects as many as 40% of people with bipolar disorder and 50% of people with schizophrenia (as well as other conditions) and is responsible for many patients refusing to take medication or discontinuing once they’ve started.\nParents often need to use whatever works to “find ways to get the person to accept treatment,” Duckworth said.\nFor example, Barbara’s daughter stopped taking medication when she got home from the hospital because she “didn’t like how the meds made her feel and she thought she didn’t need them anymore,” Barbara said.\nBarbara “bribed” her daughter to resume medication by promising to take her on a trip to Europe. “I told her we’d travel together when she’d been on medication for 6 months and I’d buy the tickets when she’d been on medication for 1 month.”\nDuckworth shared the story of a man with schizophrenia whose mother had a different approach. She made taking medication a condition for her son to live in her home. The son had enough awareness to know that he didn’t want to be homeless, so he agreed.\nLetting Them Find Their Own Way\nIt’s often necessary to be “hands-on” with a person with mental illness and offer practical assistance beyond what’s usually appropriate for most adults. Duckworth notes that this approach is sometimes discouraged by the 12-step philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous and similar groups, which teach that a person is the “agent” of their own recovery. Parents are thought to be “enabling” their child’s illness if they provide concrete assistance after the child has lost a job or home, for example, due to his/her own behavior and choices. \nBut that approach isn’t necessarily applicable to individuals with severe mental illness, who might not have the capability to be accountable for their behavior. \nBut trying to force a child into recovery won’t necessarily work either, Kaufmann said. “We realized that by making treatment acceptance the focus, we were pushing Patrick away. We weren’t giving him the space he needed to make his own decisions and he felt ‘stifled’ by us.” Patrick became more open to treatment when his parents stopped pushing for it.\nAnd once he started taking medication, “he let me know he didn’t like it when we harped on whether he had remembered to take his meds today,” Kaufmann continued. “We found that the best thing to do was to back off let him have his own struggle if necessary. After years of banging our heads against the wall, we needed to try something new, and we couldn’t do something for him that he needed to do for himself, no matter how impaired he was by his illness,” he said.\nWhen Patrick decided to return to college, Kaufmann initially had reservations. By this time, Patrick was married, and Kaufmann thought the stress of school, together with his responsibilities as a spouse and father, could be dangerously overwhelming. But it turned out to be a good decision. “Even if you see flaws in your child’s decision, they may need to try it out for themselves in order to learn. The more space you can give them, the better. But that’s the hardest thing you can do as a parent, and it never gets easier.”\nKeepers of Light and Hope\nPatients sometimes have relapses, which happened to Patrick after many years of stability. This was a reminder to Kaufmann that mental illnesses are “lifelong, and ‘recovery’ doesn’t mean ‘cure,’ although treatment does work, and recovery is possible.” Fortunately, Patrick has stabilized and is recovering from his episode.\n“Recovery isn’t linear, and it’s a journey rather than a destination,” Kaufmann said. \n“The hardest thing for us to accept as parents is that we can’t control the outcome of our child’s life,” Kaufmann said. “We want to keep our kids alive, but our worst fears sometimes happen. That’s not because of something parents did or didn’t do. It’s because of the illness itself.”\nHe added, “Even though there’s much we can’t do, we can give unconditional love—which doesn’t mean approval of their behavior all the time—and we can try to be the keeper of the light and the keeper of hope.” \nSOURCES:\nGeorge Kaufmann, California.\nKen Duckworth, MD, chief medical officer, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).\nBarbara S, New York.\nJournal of Clinical Psychiatry: “Caring for a Mentally Ill Patient at Home, Mental Health, Religiosity, and Spirituality and Their Association With Family Caregivers’ Quality of Life in Lebanon.”\nDifferences between feeling depressed or feeling blue.\nSigns of mania and depression.\nCauses, symptoms, and therapies.\nWhen food controls you.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "The Facts About Food Cravings", "date": "2023-09-27 20:35:20", "text": "Erin Morse hears about her patients' food cravings a lot, especially for \"ultra-processed\" and \"salty, sweet, crunchy\" snacks. Chips and french fries top the list, followed by doughnuts, cookies, and cakes. \nAs the chief clinical dietitian at UCLA Health, Morse offers strategies to help them handle these hard-to-resist cravings. But why do people get them in the first place?\nCravings are frequent, specific, intense desires to eat a particular type of food, says John W. Apolzan, PhD, a nutrition scientist and associate professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center of the Louisiana State University System. \nIt's not about hunger, Morse says. \"Hunger is the need for food for fuel, for nutrition, for all the good things that our bodies and our brains need,\" she says. In contrast, with cravings, \"Our bodies are telling us that we want something to eat.\"\nSnack makers know this, Morse says. \"Companies have tailored food to be extremely palatable, so people do eat a lot of it.\" \nExperts don't agree on this.\nIt's best to avoid eating craved foods, even in small amounts, Apolzan says. According to his research, \"the amount doesn't matter,\" he says. \"Completely stopping the food will reduce the craving.\" \nMorse takes another view. \"Everyone has to think about what's good for themselves,\" she says. \"I think it's best not to completely avoid things that people want. Food is not only good for nutrition, but also enjoyment.\"\nStay hydrated. Being dehydrated can make you feel hungry or increase food cravings, Morse says. So make sure that you get enough water. If cravings strike at night when it's time to relax and unwind, a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea is an option, she says.\nGet proper sleep. Not sleeping enough will rev up your appetite and hunger hormones, Morse says. The exact amount of sleep that you need might be different from someone else, but for most adults, it's at least 7 hours per night for good health.\nEat enough protein. It will help you feel satisfied longer and reduce cravings, Morse says. Some suggestions: a scrambled egg with breakfast, beans on a salad, or salmon at dinner. \"Not just a big bowl of pasta,\" Morse says. Also avoid skipping meals, which could trigger cravings, she says. \nSnack smart. Plan healthy snacks that give you fiber and protein, like Greek yogurt with berries and a handful of nuts, Morse says. A little bit of dark chocolate might satisfy a sweet tooth -- unless, like Apolzan has seen in his research, that small taste just makes you want a lot more. Swap chips for homemade popcorn made with a healthy fat, such as olive oil, which will spare you from the types with too much salt, sugar, and chemicals. \nChew gum. Gum or even brushing one's teeth with minty toothpaste are distractions that may take away a craving, Morse says. \"It works for some and not for others.\" \nBe careful with alcohol. It's famous for making people do things that they didn't plan to do. And it increases appetite, Morse says. When people drink, they may not realize how much food they're eating. \nFind healthier ways to counter stress. Stress can increase cravings, Morse says. \"Instead of reaching for the candy bin,\" Morse says, \"go outside with a colleague to get fresh air or take a 5-minute walk.\" If emotions are spurring your food cravings, \"the first step is to acknowledge the stress or the sadness or emotion,\" Morse says.\nRemove triggers. \"If you're keeping a lot of those foods that are triggers for you at home, do your best to replace those items with foods that will provide you with more nutrition,\" Morse says. \nWhat if your family or friends want to have those foods around? Talk with them about how you can all support each other, Morse says. And if your food cravings spring from difficult emotions, Morse says, \"seeking the help of a therapist or a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable on mental health\" is a good idea, too. \nSOURCES:\nErin Morse, RD, chief clinical dietitian, UCLA Health.\nJohn W.

{"title": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Coming to Terms With His AFib Diagnosis", "date": "2023-09-28 03:05:36", "text": "The basketball legend talks candidly about the long road to his atrial fibrillation diagnosis -- the symptoms he dismissed and the denial that almost killed him.\n“I went to a baseball game.”\nThat’s how NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 76, found out he had atrial fibrillation (AFib). Two years ago, he attended a Los Angeles Dodgers game, and “every time I tried to move from one place to another,\" he told WebMD CEO Bob Brisco, \"I’d get extra tingly fatigue and out of breath. And I didn't understand it.”\nThis wasn’t the first time. Abdul-Jabbar had been dealing with similar symptoms for a while and downplayed them because they’d been subtle and came and went. But now he admits they’d been getting worse over time and the ballgame was the worst yet.\nHis business manager was with him and insisted Abdul-Jabbar go to the hospital. He refused, of course – this was just a passing thing, he thought. He finally relented, however, and once at the hospital he received a quick diagnosis: AFib.\n“We can't defeat something if we can't even acknowledge that it exists,\" he said. \"The denial aspect of it is a killer. It's no big deal, it's going to go away, and then it doesn't go away. You're the one that might go away.”\nVideo Transcript\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\nBob Brisco: It's our privilege to have as our guest this morning Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. You may know him as an athlete. He's also an author, a screenwriter and activist, and a health advocate.\nKareem, we have you with us today to talk about atrial fibrillation (AFib). Why are we talking to you about AFib?\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, I'm someone who has had to deal with AFib. Just a couple years ago, I was dealing with it and it was not fun, especially because I didn't know what was happening to me.\nBrisco: Can you take us through that? How did you discover that you have it?\nAbdul-Jabbar: I started to notice that I was having shortness of breath, and at various times, I felt lightheaded and tired though I hadn't been doing anything. I went to a baseball game. I got to the Dodgers game. And every time I tried to do something, to move from one place to another, I got extra tingly fatigue and out of breath. I didn't understand it. My business manager saw what I was dealing with and told me I was going to the hospital and I was like, No, I don't want to do that.\nThe fact that I didn't want to do that was a problem, because when you're dealing with this issue, you really need help. So, finally, I went from the baseball game straight to the hospital, and I was diagnosed with AFib.\nBrisco: I want to talk a little bit about the reluctance to get care and treatment. You said you were a little reluctant because you thought, oh, this can't really be a major thing that I'm dealing with here? But then it turned out that it kind of is. Did you have thoughts about that? You've written for us before about how there's reluctance in some underprivileged communities around that in particular. Do you have thoughts about leaning in and getting the care that you need?\nAbdul-Jabbar: Many times, people wait until they can't function to say, oh, there's something wrong with me. The denial aspect of it can be a killer. You know, it can force you or incentivize you to not worry about it. It's no big deal. It's going to go away, and then it doesn't go away. And you're the one that might go away. You don’t want to be that person.\nWe should discuss the fact that AFib increases your probability of having a stroke by a factor of five. That's serious. You know, most people don't want to have strokes. I don't know anyone who does. And there are other aspects of it. The symptoms you have — shortness of breath, fatigue, lightheadedness — it's something that will continue and continue to get worse.\nBrisco: You know, on Medscape, we have about 10 million physicians and other healthcare professionals who read our coverage every day, every week, every month worldwide. And this is a topic we talk about a lot — about unequal access and what's going on there. I know everyone's trying to improve it, but it's got a long way to go still. So I think that the issues that you're raising, we can't be afraid to talk about. We need to do better on that access and supporting those communities.\nAbdul-Jabbar: I think you're absolutely right. We can't defeat something if we can't even acknowledge that it exists.\nBrisco: Is your sense that the dialogue is getting better about this a little bit?\nAbdul-Jabbar: I think we are getting momentum because people are starting to talk about the various factors that keep people from having the best results from their visits to the health system. If you understand what can go wrong and how you need to approach it, you're going to get a much better result and you will find out that something that might have been a problem in 6 months, if you deal with it now, you can rest assured that in 6 months you'll be on your way to a complete recovery. Instead of worrying about it, taking you further down a bad path.\nBrisco: What I appreciate about you, and I know our readers and viewers do, is that you lean into these topics and try to put a spotlight on what we should do better as communities, and as a society. So I want to thank you in this case as well. I think raising awareness around this is very important in your willingness to share all the aspects of your journey. And like all of ours, there are ups and downs. But I think your courage in talking about it is really a benefit. Thank you so much, Kareem. \nAbdul-Jabbar: No problem.

{"title": "What Is Food Noise and How Can You Quiet It?", "date": "2023-09-28 15:13:57", "text": "Nikki Levy opened the DoorDash app on her phone, craving Vietnamese food. Then she remembered the 95% fat-free turkey she’d defrosted: She could cook instead of ordering in. She closed the app and then reopened it, over and over. “I can go back and forth like this for an hour,” she says. \nLevy, a Los Angeles-based content executive and story coach, recently rejoined WW (formerly called Weight Watchers). She’d lost 35 pounds on WW before her 2019 wedding. Some of that weight was back, and intrusive food thoughts made it hard to stick with the plan.\nThis is the internal chatter that’s sometimes called “food noise.” It doesn’t have an official definition. Levy calls it a “barrage” of thoughts that nudge her toward the food she craves. “I’ll eat the thing and be revitalized and everything will be better,” Levy says. “But it never actually is.”\nThere are ways to turn down the volume on food noise, with or without the newest type of obesity medication. \nEveryone thinks about food to some extent. We all need calories and nutrients to survive. Plus, food is part of all cultures and a source of enjoyment.\nBut thoughts about food can become excessive and harmful.\n“It often comes up with patients,” says Steven Batash, MD, founder of Batash Endoscopic Weight Loss Center in Queens, NY. “Some people become almost dysfunctional because all they think about all day is food.”\nA key issue is how we respond to our food noise, says David Creel, PhD, a psychologist, registered dietitian, and exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic. “It can certainly be a problem,” Creel says, if it prompts unhealthy eating and leads to, or worsens, obesity or other medical conditions.\nMany things affect weight, including genetic, social, cultural, economic, and environmental influences. Psychology is also part of it. \nThoughts about food can be triggered by internal cues (including hormones involved in hunger and appetite) and external ones (like smelling freshly baked cookies or seeing a fast-food ad). Both can contribute to food noise, Creel says. \nIf food noise is overwhelming and your body mass index (BMI) is in the obesity range, the newest obesity medications may be an option. These meds, called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, include semaglutide. \nSemaglutide was developed to treat type 2 diabetes. It still does that under the brand name Ozempic. It’s also the active ingredient in the obesity medication Wegovy.\nGLP-1 agonists like semaglutide slow down how quickly food leaves the stomach. That makes you feel full longer. \nThese meds also target brain areas involved in appetite. In a small study, people with obesity who took semaglutide ate less and their cravings for sugar and high-fat snacks dimmed.\nIt’s not yet clear if that happens for everyone taking these meds. But in his clinic, Batash says, “Patients tell me, ‘I no longer think about food all the time.'” \nHe describes several theories about how this may happen. These drugs may stimulate the hypothalamus, a brain area that plays a role in controlling hunger and fullness. They may also block the release of the brain chemical dopamine. That makes food less rewarding.\nThe effect is temporary, Batash cautions. Stop the medication and the food noise is likely to return. \nCreel agrees that these medications can help. But he says they’re best used with other approaches. \n“I don’t think medication will solve things permanently for most people long-term, so being able to change your relationship with food is really important,” Creel says. “Medication doesn’t make you exercise, control what you put in your shopping cart, or dictate what you do when you’re bored.” \nIf you want to curb food noise without obesity medications – such as if you shouldn't take them, your insurance won’t cover them, or you’re wary of the side effects – you have options. As with medication, none of these alone are a perfect solution, but they may help, Creel and Batash say. \nWork on stress and sleep. When you’re anxious, irritable, or not rested, you may think more about food because eating temporarily makes you feel better, Batash says.\nFind positive ways to manage stress and anxiety, such as deep breathing exercises, spending time in nature or with loved ones, or being physically active. Depending on your situation, mental health counseling and treatment may also help.\nEat more often. If you get too hungry or deprive yourself of food, that may spur food noise – and trigger overeating when you finally give yourself permission to eat, Batash says. His advice: Stay hydrated, try to eat three to four times a day, and get enough protein and fiber to help you feel full. \nTweak your environment. You can’t control everything in your surroundings. So focus on what you can change. For instance, if ice cream is a food you’d like to limit, don’t put it front and center in the freezer where you see it all the time, Creel says. Look for patterns. Notice when food noise is loudest and most problematic. If it’s while streaming shows, could you watch in a part of your home that’s not close to the kitchen? “The goal is to break the habit so you don’t evoke the same hunger and desire to eat,” Creel says. \nEat more mindfully. Slow down and curb distractions. Engage all your senses and chew thoroughly. Savor each bite and stop eating when you feel satisfied. \nPhoto Credit:\nGetty Images.\n \nSOURCES:\nDavid Creel, PhD, RD, psychologist, registered dietitian; exercise physiologist, Cleveland Clinic. \nSteven Batash, MD, founder, Batash Endoscopic Weight Loss Center, Queens, NY.\nDiabetes, Obesity & Metabolism: “Effects of Oral Semaglutide on Energy Intake, Food Preference, Appetite, Control of Eating and Body Weight in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes.”\nHarvard T.H.

{"title": "Eczema: Keeping a Positive Body Image", "date": "2023-09-28 16:01:40", "text": "Gabby Bachner, a pharmacy student at the University of Georgia in Athens, found out she had eczema soon after she went to college. The specific type she has, called contact dermatitis, happens when her body touches something that causes an allergic reaction. Bachner, who works in a pharmacy, found that her scrubs and certain lotions triggered her eczema flare-ups.\n \nEczema can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, including:\nThese changes can also have an emotional and mental impact. Bachner says her eczema flares definitely affect her self-confidence.\nYour skin is your largest organ, so problems with the way it looks can have a psychological impact.\nLower self-confidence can take a toll on your mental health. “With eczema both in children and adults, we do know that there's a higher rate of depression, ADHD, anxiety, and also a lot of sleep disturbances,” says Mamta Jhaveri, MD, assistant professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGabby Bachner\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPeople with eczema have a higher chance of getting depression and anxiety than those without it. The odds are even higher if you have severe eczema. This can lead to a frustrating cycle. “Stress makes eczema worse and eczema makes stress worse,” Jhaveri says.\nThere are three main ways eczema can affect your mental health:\nBachner says past vacations with eczema were never stress-free. Before a trip, she would often get a pedicure. Lotions used during the treatment led to eczema flares on her legs. And since many eczema therapies don’t work right away, she couldn’t get the outbreak under control before she left. That made it difficult to feel confident in a bathing suit. She was afraid people would mistake her condition for an infection.\nThe combination of lower self-confidence, itch, and fatigue can make it hard to be around others during a flare. People with eczema often crave a comfortable and private setting. You may need to stay home and take care of your skin.\n“It does lead to a lot of missed work, missed school, and people sometimes opt out of social interactions,” Jhaveri says. “Eczema can also impact intimacy. ... If it impacts the face or any intimate parts, it can impact relationships.”\nWhen Jhaveri treats someone with eczema, she also uses anxiety and depression rating scales to gauge how their skin condition affects their mental health.\nBut the first line of treatment is always to control the eczema. “Sometimes that in itself will help the mental side effects,” she says. If skin symptoms don’t go away, Jhaveri will help people find more assistance.\nThe path to building confidence is slightly different for children than it is for adults. There are some things parents can do to help build their child’s self-image:\nThese steps can help adults improve their mental health and body image:\nSOURCES:\nGabby Bachner, Cumming, GA.\nMayo Clinic: “Atopic dermatitis (eczema),” “Contact dermatitis.”\nNational Health Service: “Atopic eczema.”\nAmerican Psychological Association: “The link between skin and psychology.”\nAmerican Academy of Allergy: “Adults with Atopic Eczema at Risk of Anxiety and Depression.”\nMamta Jhaveri, MD, MS, assistant professor of dermatology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.\nMedications and methods your doctor may recommend for relief.\nkin problems that have similar symptoms but aren’t eczema.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Eczema in Hard-to-Treat Places: What Helps?", "date": "2023-09-28 16:18:12", "text": "If you or your child has eczema, you’re probably no stranger to the itchiness, inflammation, and rash-like symptoms it can bring on. You can get eczema anywhere on your body. Exactly where depends partly on how old you are, says Kalyani Marathe, MD, a pediatric dermatologist and director of the Division of Dermatology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.\nInfants tend to get eczema on their:\nOlder children and teens tend to get symptoms in creases or on places where they sweat, like their:\nAdults are more likely to get eczema on their hands, Marathe says, perhaps because they wash their hands and do the dishes more. It’s also common for symptoms to show up on the:\nAdults are less likely to get facial and scalp eczema, Marathe says.\nBoth adults and children can get eyelid eczema, she says. That’s often due to an allergic reaction to something touching the skin.\nThe amount and type of treatment that’s right for you or your child also depends on where the eczema is, Marathe says. Some areas are harder to treat than others.\nTreatment can be trickier when eczema flares up on parts of your body with thinner skin, like your lips, the areas around your eyes, and your groin.\nSteroids, the most common treatment, can thin out your skin if you overuse them, which could lead to bruising and tearing, says Steve Daveluy MD, an associate professor and program director at Wayne State Dermatology in Michigan. Accidentally getting steroids in your eyes can also raise your chances for a temporary type of glaucoma, which could affect your vision, he says.\nStill, you can safely use low-strength (weaker) steroids on your face and groin, Daveluy says. You just have to be careful. Work with your dermatologist to make sure you’re using the right strength for the right amount of time, and call them right away if you have side effects.\nYour dermatologist might also recommend nonsteroid drugs, like ones called topical calcineurin inhibitors. “They’re great because they don’t have the same side effects as steroids -- they don’t thin the skin, there’s no risk of glaucoma -- so they’re super-safe to use on the face and on the genitals,” Daveluy says. The only possible drawbacks, he says, are that they can sting a bit at first, and getting your insurance to cover them might be a hurdle. Nonsteroid medications also include crisaborole (Eucrisa) ointment, ruxolitinib (Opzelura) cream, and abrocitinib (Cibinqo) or upadacitinib (Rinvoq) pills.\nWant to try home remedies to ease your symptoms? The kinds that might help also depend partly on where the eczema shows up. (Note: Talk to your doctor before you try home remedies on a baby.)\nWet wraps, which can help medicines work better, work well on body parts where the skin is thicker, like the legs, feet, hands, wrists, and forearms, Marathe says. To make a wet wrap:\nYou can do the same thing with store-bought tubular dressings. The only difference is that you soak them in warm water and wring them out, so they’re damp when you put them on, Marathe says.\nIf your small child has eczema, you can do something similar if they wear long-sleeved pajamas at night: Soak the PJs in warm water, then put them in the dryer for a few seconds so they’re damp but warm. “Sometimes kids will sleep in them, so [parents] put dry pajamas on top of that,” Marathe says. “Some kids really like that because it has a bit of a cooling sensation, but for other kids it’s too cold for them, so they don’t really like it.”\nA couple of whole-body home remedies can also help. “Diluted bleach baths are great for people of all ages, and we recommend them for kids as well,” Marathe says. You can get the benefits from swimming in a chlorinated pool, or by making a bleach bath at home. Use a quarter-cup of plain bleach -- not concentrated -- for half of a tub of water, or half a cup for a full tub of water, she says. Whether you go swimming in a pool or take a bleach bath, it’s important to shower or to rinse off right afterward. If the chlorine dries on your skin, it’s likely to make you itchier, Marathe says.\nA little bit of sunlight can help ease the itch of eczema, too, she says. Go outside for 15 minutes without sunscreen before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m., when the sun’s ultraviolet rays are weaker.\nOther ways to ease the itch in tough-to-treat areas include:\nMoisturize. To keep your skin from getting dry, inflamed, and irritated, your daily moisturizer is a must, Daveluy says. Choose one with no fragrance, which can irritate the skin. The most important thing is to find one that you like and that you’ll use at least once a day, he says. “Most people need it more than once a day.”\nWash off pollen. If you notice your eczema flares up during pollen season, rinse your face after you’ve been outside for a while, Daveluy says. Put on moisturizer right after.\nCool off. Instead of scratching or rubbing a lot, which can damage skin, ease the itch with an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas. “Ice actually soothes itch really well, because the same nerves that feel itch feel cold,” he says. You can also put your moisturizing cream in the refrigerator.\nMake a soothing mask. “You can make a facial mask out of rice paper, like the kind they use to make spring rolls or fresh rolls,” Daveluy says. “You basically cut eye holes and a mouth hole … and then you get it wet [with water]. You can put that on to soothe the skin, because it has some natural moisturizing effects in it from the starch in the rice. Some people even wear it to bed.” You may want to cut the rice paper in two before you wet it, because it can be hard to handle.\nTry massage. If your child’s face itches at night, massage some moisturizer into their skin before bedtime, Daveluy says. “They’ve done some studies that found massage can be soothing for kids with eczema and help them fall asleep. And it can actually help improve the eczema, probably by helping it calm down a little.”\nShop safely. Talk to your dermatologist before you use over-the-counter products for your groin, especially for women’s genitals. Many of these products have a lot of ingredients that can irritate eczema, Daveluy says.\nSOURCES:\nSteve Daveluy MD, associate professor; program director, Wayne State Dermatology, Michigan.\nKalyani Marathe, MD, pediatric dermatologist; director, Division of Dermatology, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital; associate professor, Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati.\nNational Eczema Association: “What is Eczema?”\nPenn Medicine: “Eczema vs. Psoriasis: Similarities, Differences and Treatments.”\nCleveland Clinic: “Eczema.”\nMedications and methods your doctor may recommend for relief.\nkin problems that have similar symptoms but aren’t eczema.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Eczema and Your Relationships", "date": "2023-09-28 16:21:20", "text": "Self-confidence hasn’t always come easy to Linette Roungchun. The 35-year-old eczema advocate spent the first half of her life worried about how her skin looked to others. But over time, she says, living with the skin condition helped her form “incredibly real” connections.\n“Everyone has that vulnerable side to them,” Roungchun says. “When they see you be vulnerable first, they feel like they can be themselves. That’s why I’ve had very good fortune when it comes to relationships and friendships in my life.”\nThere's no cure for eczema. But your symptoms don't have to get in the way of your relationships. And you might be surprised by what happens when you’re comfortable with yourself and open about your condition.\nRoungchun, who also has topical steroid withdrawal (TSW), met her current partner on Instagram. He’s also a part of the eczema and TSW community. (TSW is a condition in which you develop symptoms like burning, stinging, and bright red skin after you stop taking topical steroid medications.)\nBut she’s used dating apps in the past. She’d post photos without any skin-smoothing filters. And just in case they didn’t get a close look at her pics, she’d bring up her eczema before the first date.\n“It’s not that I’m insecure about it, but it’s a physical attribute that’s a huge part of my life,” she says. “And I wanted them to know.”\nShe says her honesty led to some “beautiful moments.” Her dates didn’t seem concerned about her looks. Instead, they’d check in to see how she was feeling. Would a certain restaurant be better for her allergies? Did she have her medicine?\n“They wanted to make sure I was comfortable, that I was OK and had the things that I needed,” Roungchun says.\nBeyond being up-front about your eczema, Roungchun recommends some practical preparations before you head out on dates. This is especially important if they may last overnight. Consider packing a bag with:\nLindsey Bordone, MD, assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center, says one reason to bring skin care products with you is that eczema can feel worse at night. That's because your body's cortisol levels naturally go down in the evening. This stress hormone acts as a natural anti-inflammatory during the day.\nIf first-date jitters have you stressed out, think twice about having a cocktail to calm your nerves. Drinking makes some people itchier, Bordone says.\nWhether you're looking for love, friendship, or support, you might feel more at ease around people who understand what you’re going through. Roungchun says she can see someone from afar and know whether they share her symptoms.\n“I know that skin pattern. I know that look. I’ve experienced it my whole life,” she says. “They don’t even have to say anything and we’re family already.”\nRoungchun lives in California, where she leads in-person and virtual meetups with others in the eczema and TSW communities. Sometimes she hosts a global remote chat with the help of her partner, who lives in London.\n“We started something called The Itch Factor, which is basically itchy performing arts people trying to get through this crazy condition together,” she says.\nSearch for online groups, local meetups, or social media hashtags to find like-minded folks. You can find groups on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nYour friends and family may know more about eczema than you think. But Bordone says an easy way to explain your symptoms is to say you have a skin condition that flares up from time to time. It can cause lots of itching and pain.\nRoungchun describes her eczema in a little more detail. She likens it to an injury that gives you a big open scab, except the wound covers your whole body -- and it itches at the same time.\nWhen talking to your family, she says, you could point out that eczema ranks just below cerebral palsy in how much it can affect quality of life. “It really does have such a large impact,” she says.\nHowever you explain them, don’t keep your symptoms to yourself. The support of spouses, partners, friends, and family can make a big difference in your life.\nAnd when they know what's going on with you, they'll be more understanding when you need to cancel a social outing or don't want to wear an itchy lace bridesmaid dress.\nLet your loved ones know if eczema gets in the way of your daily life, like if it:\nNot only can eczema make you feel embarrassed about your skin, but the itching and pain might sometimes get so bad that you don't want to leave the house. But staying engaged with others is important for your mental -- and physical -- health. To help save your social life:\nDon’t isolate yourself. You might feel less self-conscious when you avoid others. But an ongoing condition, such as eczema, raises your risk of anxiety and depression. Loneliness may make these feelings even worse. “It’s better for your mental health to be around people,” Bordone says.\nMake time for big events. You don’t need to go to every social outing. But Roungchun tries not to miss out on a niece or nephew’s birthday party or a friend’s wedding. “Go to the things that’ll never happen again,” she says.\nGet out of your head. Roungchun says she forgets about her skin when she’s on stage. That’s one reason she loves performing arts, such as opera. But everyone's different. “You just need to find that thing that really grabs you and makes the rest of the world fall away,” she says.\nSeek mental health care. A psychiatrist or psychologist can help you manage life with an ongoing illness. They’ll also give you an outlet to talk about how eczema makes you feel. That can be a big help when you’re really troubled by your condition, Bordone says.\nThe bottom line is there’s no need to hide your eczema or let it keep you from the good things in life. That includes strong friendships and intimate relationships. “This illness can’t take that away from you,” Roungchun says.\nSOURCES:\nLindsey Bordone, MD, assistant professor of dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center.\nLinette Roungchun, eczema and topical steroid withdrawal advocate, Southern California.\nNational Eczema Association: “Eczema and Emotional Wellness,” \"Education Announcement: Use of Topical Steroids for Eczema.\"\nThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice: “Atopic Eczema in Adulthood and Risk of Depression and Anxiety: A Population-Based Cohort Study.”\nJournal of Investigative Dermatology: “The Burden of Atopic Dermatitis: Summary of a Report for the National Eczema Association.”\nChildren: “Quality of Life and Disease Impact of Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis on Children and Their Families.”\nMedications and methods your doctor may recommend for relief.\nkin problems that have similar symptoms but aren’t eczema.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

To perform in pointe shoes was out of the question. \n“There’s no way I’ll be a dancer anymore,” Graf Mack says she once thought.\nNow the dean and director of the Dance Division at The Juilliard School – and the first Black person and the youngest person to hold that role – Graf Mack says AS has shaped her life in surprising ways. And she has advice to help other people get diagnosed sooner and manage it.\nAs a teen in the Dance Theatre of Harlem, Graf Mack had symptoms that were easy to dismiss. “I was training like an Olympic athlete, so you expect aches and pains,” she says. “Most dancers have that every day.”\nBut her symptoms got worse. Even after surgery and rehab for a small knee cartilage tear, the pain didn’t quit. She couldn’t even walk to the subway to go to follow-up visits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlicia Graf Mack reimagined her future for health reasons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“For 6 months or so after the surgery, no one could give me any answers,” Graf Mack says. “My whole dream for my life was wrapped up in the health of my body. I really hit rock bottom.”\nShe reached out to her cousin, Jonathan Graf, MD, a rheumatology professor at the University of California San Francisco. He reviewed her medical records, concluded that she had reactive arthritis, and prescribed anti-inflammatory medication. \nGraf Mack’s knee swelling began to ease. But over time, more problems followed. She consulted knee and ankle specialists, had more operations, and did physical therapy constantly.\nWith an extremely demanding physical career looking out of reach, Graf Mack started to imagine a different life. She enrolled at Columbia University, aiming for a career in arts administration. She kept going to PT and taking medication. She was even able to join a student-led praise dance ministry. By senior year, she was strong enough to be back in classical dance classes just because she loved it.\nWith a corporate job on the horizon, she had one last summer free after college. She reached out to New York’s Complexions Contemporary Ballet, hoping for a summer job in arts administration or marketing. \nBut the founders of Complexions, dance icons Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, had another idea. “We hear you’re dancing again,” they told her. “We have a tour of Italy this summer, and one of our dancers is injured. Can you come back?” \nGraf Mack was apprehensive. She hadn’t danced full-time or performed in a long time. But it might be her last chance. \n“I said, ‘I’m going to be doing a desk job for the rest of my life. Let me do this.’ ”\nGraf Mack ditched the corporate path and danced for famed companies including the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the San Francisco-based Alonzo King LINES Ballet, and Alvin Ailey. \nMeanwhile, she still had her chronic condition, which she still thought was reactive arthritis. She remembers switching to a new disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, or DMARD, called adalimumab (Humira), when it came on the market in 2003 – and the challenges that came with it.\n“I had to figure out how to travel with the syringes, keeping them cold during 18-hour international travel days, finding out which hotels had refrigerators in them, ensuring that medications were shipped to hotels on the right schedule,” she says. “That was choreography in itself!”\nBlurry vision, along with pain and redness in her eyes, was how Graf Mack learned that she had AS.\nHer eye problem was uveitis, an inflammatory condition. Graf Mack’s rheumatologist told her that uveitis pointed toward AS. It’s common in people with AS, but not in those with reactive arthritis, Caplan says.\nHer doctors got the uveitis under control, and Graf Mack was able to keep dancing as a pro. \n“I had another 5 or 6 more years of dancing, a blessing that I never expected would happen,” she says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s strange, but I never would have had such a full life if I hadn’t been stopped in my tracks by my body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAfter yet another knee surgery, she moved to St. Louis with her now-husband, Kirby Mack, to get a master’s degree in arts management. \nShe would still perform and even returned to Alvin Ailey for 3 more years. She finally retired in 2014 after surgery for a herniated disk. She’s since become a mom to a son and daughter, the host of a dance podcast called Moving Moments, and the founder of a comprehensive wellness program for young dancers at Juilliard. \n“I’m still taking Humira, with a round of prednisone every so often for flare-ups,” she says. Although her back and hips are “really stiff most days,” she stays very active and still performs on occasion. \n“I consider myself super blessed because I know so many people with AS are in an extreme amount of pain,” Graf Mack says. In hindsight, without AS, “I never would have discovered my love for teaching or realized that I wanted to work in a university setting,” she says. “It’s strange, but I never would have had such a full life if I hadn’t been stopped in my tracks by my body.”\nGraf Mack has this advice for people facing an AS diagnosis:\nFind a supportive doctor. “At first, I was seeing doctors who didn’t fully believe me, and that made it so much harder,” she says. “With this disease, flare-ups can happen at any time and can get bad fast, and you should have a doctor who can be reached quickly and not make you wait 3 months for an appointment.”\nManage it one day at a time. “This is a condition that is not going to go away,” Graf Mack says. “You have to be proactive in taking charge of your condition and working with your doctor and other members of your care team. Find a great doctor and take it day by day.”\nBe patient with yourself. “Some days are going to be really bad,” she says. “I’d allow myself that. ‘Today is a bad day. I’m going to allow myself to be angry and cry and do all the things. But that’s all I get, and tomorrow I’m going to get up and do something that makes me feel good.’ ”\nPhoto Credits:\nPhoto of Alicia Graf Mack teaching by Rachel Papo, courtesy of Juilliard.\nPortrait of Alicia Graf Mack by Gregory Costanzo, courtesy of Juilliard.\n \nSOURCES:\nAlicia Graf Mack.\nLiron Caplan, MD, PhD, associate professor of rheumatology, University of Colorado School of Medicine.\nCommon Spine Problems\nWhat Is Ankylosing Spondylitis?\nPosture Tips for AS\nHow AS Affects Your Eyes\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "How What You Eat Is Linked to Midlife Weight Gain", "date": "2023-09-28 18:36:34", "text": "Sept. 28, 2023 – The message about weight gain in midlife is probably familiar: Avoid excess sugar, starchy vegetables and refined carbohydrates. At the same time, eat more fruit, whole grains, and green, leafy vegetables rich in fiber. \nA new large study confirms these recommendations, but researchers also calculated, on average, how the quantity and quality of what you eat can affect weight gain over time. \nEating an extra 100 grams a day of starch from vegetables like corn, green peas, or potatoes was linked to 3.3 pounds more weight gain over 4 years, for example. In contrast, adding 10 grams per day more of fiber was linked to 1.75 pounds less weight gain at the same time. (For comparison, one medium russet potato is about 170 grams, one cup of green peas is 150 grams, and one ear of corn is about 100 grams)\nThe researchers found that women with excess weight gained more weight, compared to men. \nNot All Vegetables Are Created Equal\nThe findings are generally consistent with previous research, said study author Yi Wan, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. But unlike many previous studies, Wan and colleagues make the distinction between unfavorable, starchy vegetables and favorable, non-starchy ones. Finding a larger effect among people with excess weight has not been widely reported either, he said. \nThe study was published online Wednesday in the journal BMJ. \nThe researchers also looked at extra sugar, including sugary drinks. Adding 100 grams per day of sugar (about 24 teaspoons, or about three 12-ounce cans of soda per day) was linked to almost 2 pounds more weight gained over 4 years.\n“The quality and source of carbohydrates is crucial for long-term weight management, especially for people already with excessive body weight,” Wan said. “Transitioning from low-quality carbohydrate food sources to high-quality sources may support efforts to control body weight.” \nSpecifically, shifting away from added sugar, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, and starchy vegetables and toward adding whole grains, fruits, and non-starchy vegetables can help,  he said.\nThe advantages could go beyond less midlife weight gain, Wan said, “Other studies have shown that this shift would also reduce risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.”\nWan and colleagues followed 136,432 men and women who were healthy and younger than 65 when they enrolled in 1986 or 1991 in one of three long-term health studies. Researchers checked in on their health, diet, and wellness every 2 to 4 years over 24 years. \nOverall weight gain was common. On average, people gained 3.3 pounds every 4 years or 19.4 pounds over the 24 years. \nThe Advice is Not Anti-Potato \n“People can take away from this research that a diet rich in non-starchy vegetables and whole grains may result in a healthier weight,” said registered dietitian Kristen Smith, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, who was not involved in the study. “This research supports my current practice with clients who are seeking to maintain a healthier weight.”\nThe researchers are not recommending people cut out all peas, corn, and potatoes, said registered dietitian Jessica Alvarez, PhD, “but more about making sure to incorporate other kinds of vegetables.” \nThis research reinforces the messages health professionals give us, said Alvarez, a spokesperson for the Obesity Society, “and they show it in a very large, well-designed study.”\nSome messages about diet and weight management can be oversimplified or misleading, she said. But this study reinforces the “tried and true” advice about eating whole grains and leafy vegetables. “I feel like that needs to be reinforced more often than it is.”\nSmith offered a couple of caveats. The research focused on preventing weight gain and not weight loss. Also, the study had an observational design, meaning the links between quantity and quality of the foods and weight gain were not cause-and-effect relationships. Wan and colleagues also noted that people self-reported their diets, which is also a potential limitation. \nAlvarez said research findings like this can help people interested in gaining less weight in midlife adjust their diets. For example, someone may have already reduced excess sugar in their diet, but they continue to eat a lot of starchy vegetables. This gives them a chance to “see what you are eating more or less of and try to tweak it.”\nSOURCES:\nYi Wan, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow, Harvard T.H.

{"title": "FDA Adds Warning of Intestinal Blockages to Ozempic Label", "date": "2023-09-28 19:19:02", "text": "Sept. 28, 2023 – Following more than a dozen reports of intestinal blockages among people using the diabetes drug Ozempic, the FDA announced that the potentially life-threatening condition will be listed on the drug’s label.\nThe medical term for intestinal blockage is “ileus,” and 18 cases of it in people taking Ozempic have been reported to the FDA. \nThe FDA has received more than 8,500 reports of gastrointestinal issues among people taking medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, the latter of which is approved for weight loss. Ileus is mentioned in 33 cases, including two deaths, of people taking drugs containing semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Ozempic, Wegovy, and another widely used weight loss drug called Mounjaro. \nSemaglutide works by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that targets brain regions that regulate appetite and food intake. The labels for Mounjaro, Ozempic, and Wegovy already mention that delayed stomach emptying can occur. Significant weight loss is associated with taking semaglutide, often in the range of 15% of body weight.\nThe FDA stopped short of saying there is a direct link between Ozempic and intestinal blockages.\n“Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure,” the FDA said in its approval of the label update.\nThe same warning for the risk of intestinal blockages is already listed on the labels for Mounjaro and Wegovy.\nThe label change comes after a Louisiana woman filed a lawsuit in August that claims she was “severely injured” after using Mounjaro and Ozempic and that the pharmaceutical companies failed to disclose the drugs’ risk of causing vomiting and diarrhea due to inflammation of the stomach lining, as well as the risk of stomach paralysis (known as gastroparesis.)\nSOURCES:\nFDA: “FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Public Dashboard,” “Drug Safety-related Labeling Changes (SrLC) OZEMPIC (NDA-209637) 09/22/2023 (SUPPL-20).” \nTest your knowledge of different types.\nWhat to know before taking them.\nAre they closer than you think?\nWhat to expect.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Mental Well-being for Cancer and Beyond", "date": "2023-09-28 20:21:22", "text": "\nAfter a cancer diagnosis, you’ll be concerned about your physical health. But your mental well-being is equally important. It’s crucial that you care for your mind as you would your body.\nIn the WebMD webinar,\n\"Mental Wellness for Cancer and Beyond,\"\nLidia Schapira, MD, explained why taking control of your mental health after a cancer diagnosis is key. She covered how reducing your stress, finding support, and taking control of your story help you go from victim to empowered survivor.\nSchapira directs the Cancer Survivorship Program at Stanford Cancer Institute and Comprehensive Cancer Center, where she focuses on breast cancer and mental health care within oncology.\n“What I’ve learned from my experience is that mental well-being is a big part of health,” said Schapira. “It's very important that you attend to your mental wellness from the moment of diagnosis – and from then on.”\nSchapira gave strategies for easing the stress of cancer and other serious diagnoses. \nA webinar poll found that 74% of attendees cope with such news by learning about their medical condition.\nQuestion: This helps me most when facing a serious diagnosis:\nAnother poll asked about \nsupport\n, a known benefit tied to better health and outcomes. \n“Connecting with others and receiving support is really fundamental to being able to get through cancer, live with it, and move beyond,” said Schapira. \nOver two-thirds of those questioned said they find support through family and friends.\nQuestion: I find support during hardships from:\nTo shift your mindset, Schapira said it’s important to ask:\n“Thinking about these things helps us prepare and have a little bit of a strategy,” said Schapira. \n“Cancer is difficult and uncertain at times. \nWe need to have a plan\nfor dealing with various symptoms and emotions. This could mean reaching in the medicine cabinet for a prescription, turning on music, having a bath, having a conversation with a friend, and so much more.”\nSchapira explained the stress paradox. While we know too much\nstress\ncan be bad, some can be helpful. \n“Stress can actually help us mobilize ourselves to think about what we want to do with the rest of our lives,” she said.\nYour body’s stress response is designed to meet the demands you face. You can find productive ways to cope with new sources of stress. In some cases, you can turn that stress into something that challenges you to make a plan for what you want out of your cancer journey.\nHow do you mend relationships that were damaged after a cancer diagnosis and during cancer treatments?\nHow can you become more comfortable asking others for help or relying on others?\nEach situation can be so different. But it’s always good to figure out if a conversation can help. If you need special help with the conversation, maybe you can bring in a mediator or somebody else. But the reality is that sometimes, there are relationship shifts.\nSometimes, we have a friend whom we thought would be more helpful and “be there” for us after a cancer diagnosis, but they weren’t. This relationship may be affected forever. But we might also receive kindness from people who we didn't expect to get it from. And that may bring these people closer.\nAll of these shifts in relationships may happen after a cancer diagnosis. \nSometimes, relationship changes require attention. It may be difficult to navigate this. But if it's possible to repair relationships. If there’s enough love and trust, it's possible.\nWithin your relationships, you may feel you need to ask for help or rely on others after a cancer diagnosis. Having the courage to ask for help, and allowing yourself to do so, is important. \nBe compassionate with yourself. Know that it’s OK to ask for a little extra help. You’re not “failing” by asking for support.\nTo get more comfortable with this, start by asking someone you trust or love. Ask questions like, “I wish you could be there with me when I hear the results of my scans,” or “I'm having trouble coping with all of these things I'm doing for the kids. Could you come and take over for me for just an evening?” \nWhatever it is, be specific about what you need. Starting with an ask that seems manageable. And then, if they’re helpful, you can begin to ask for more help.\nYou may feel you can do everything yourself. But that’s a quick way to get overwhelmed. Don’t let yourself get to this point. \nIf you can ask for help, do it. If you’re really stuck and don’t have someone to go to, talk with your cancer care team and see if they’re able to offer support.\nHow does cancer fog or “chemo brain” affect mental health?\nIs it hard to sustain life lessons and coping skills from cancer long term?\nCancer fog and\n“chemo brain”\nrefer to thinking and memory issues that can happen during and after your cancer treatment. Having cancer in general can also affect your ability to focus.\nThere’s a whole spectrum of things you may notice. You may be distracted, anxious, or have a hard time remembering things. For some, this can be a serious side effect or problem that requires professional help.\nThere's a lot of research about ways to map out areas of your brain affected by cancer fog or “chemo brain.” Experts track these symptoms to understand more about them.\nSome experts suggest using techniques similar to ones used for an older brain. You may be able to help your cancer fog through games, puzzles, or cognitive therapies that help you stay sharp.\nBut cancer fog and “chemo brain” remain challenging. You might be unable to return to your job because you can’t perform as quickly or precisely as before. This can affect many aspects of your life, including your mental health. If this is happening to you, bring it to the attention of your cancer care team. You can get an evaluation and speak with them about ways to treat this symptom.\nOn the flip side, there are many skills you can take away from your cancer journey. Resilience, or posttraumatic growth, happens when you go through a life-threatening challenge like cancer. When you face intense distress, you may develop a new level of strength you didn't know you had.\nThese experiences can lead to more meaningful lives. And that can extend to your circle of loved ones. Especially with children who’ve seen a parent go through cancer. They tend to become more resilient.\nYou may feel better able to manage other types of stress when you’ve been able to manage cancer. You’re able to manage other challenges and crises in your life. \nThis is why it's important to address mental health and mental well-being during and after cancer. There are ways for you and your loved ones to become stronger and live life more intensely.\nAre mental health issues related to cancer usually short or long term?\nShould mental health counseling be part of every cancer treatment plan?\nThere's a spectrum of \nmental distress\nthat can develop from a cancer journey. You may feel distressed, afraid, or anxious. In other cases, these emotions can develop into more physical symptoms. They may affect your sleep, your ability to perform, or your mood. You may become depressed, develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or have other heightened mental health issues that require help from an expert.\nEveryone’s cancer experience is different. If your symptoms create issues in your life (short-term or long-term), you may want to have an assessment where a mental health expert spends time asking questions. They can find the therapy, medication, or other option that helps you best. \nRemember, it’s not a sign of weakness to need extra support. It’s crucial that you manage your mental health. This helps you minimize long-term issues, even after your cancer is cured.\nIn an ideal world, mental health care would be a part of everyone’s cancer care. But in the U.S., there aren’t enough mental health professionals to care for everyone with cancer. \nSince there’s not a formal 1:1 mental health care during cancer treatment, be quick to ask for help if you need it. It’s important to learn what mental health is. This could mean learning new relaxation methods or picking up meditation.\nMost places that offer cancer care, either in community settings or cancer centers, do have mental health teams. So it’s crucial that you ask what’s available.\nWatch a replay of the WebMD webinar, \n\"Mental Wellness for Cancer and Beyond.\"\n \nWatch other free\nWebMD webinars by leading experts \non a variety of health topics. \nPagination\nThings your doctor considers when making a recommendation.\nWhat to know about today's surgical procedures.\n© 2005 - 2019 WebMD LLC.

People in this age bracket are the most likely to need hospital care for or to die from the flu. “As we age, our immune system response doesn’t work as well for vaccines,” Stinchfield says. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) of the CDC recently decided to recommend higher-dose vaccines or vaccines with adjuvants – ingredients in the vaccine that boost immunity – for older people. Another thing that might help to protect this age group is to make sure people in all racial and ethnic groups can get it.\nThe answer is everyone, but for some people, it’s vital.\nPeople over 65.

You might worry that having a vaccine when you’re pregnant might harm the baby. The opposite is true, Stinchfield says. “Pregnant women really ought to have an influenza vaccine,” she says. She prefers the word “influenza” because “flu” makes the illness seem milder than it is.Pregnant women also are more likely to get severe cases that mean a hospital stay.

Even when we’re sick, we often find ourselves running to the store for “just for a couple of things.” The average cart or basket is used many times a day, collecting bacteria that can include E. coli and salmonella that can live on them for 2 to 8 hours.

{"title": "Shortages, Cost, and Frustration: Quest for the New COVID Shot", "date": "2023-09-29 20:48:44", "text": "Sept. 29, 2023 – If you’re having trouble getting the latest COVID-19 booster, you’re not alone.\nAs the rollout of the newly formulated shot begins in earnest, many Americans are finding roadblocks, while federal officials urge everyone to be patient and get the shot when you can.\nDana Tofig was lucky. He signed up for the latest COVID-19 vaccine the minute it became available. When his appointment time came, he stood in line at a CVS in Gaithersburg, MD, and received his shot. Just as he finished, the pharmacy clerk told everyone in line behind to go home: There were no more doses available.\nHe said the pharmacy also had to cancel everyone’s appointments for the following day. \n“The woman who gave me the shot said that [the pharmacy] had been given what they had anticipated was a week's supply – it ended up just lasting a few days,” said Tofig, 56. \nDespite appointments continuing to be canceled, a statement released after a meeting held by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and health insurance company leaders said that more than 6 million vaccines have been shipped to pharmacies and, so far, 2 million Americans have received their shots. \nAnd according to a statement from Moderna, the maker of one of two authorized vaccines, the company has shipped millions of doses to distributors across the country and are “working to support these distributors to ensure that the significant supply of vaccines we have already provided to them continues to rapidly reach pharmacies and other points of care.”\nIn tandem with vaccine supply issues, those who have been able to get the shot have been running into trouble getting insurance to pay for it, reportedly due to technical issues. In a letter,  major health insurance companies assured customers that they “largely, if not completely, resolved,” these technical issues and are committed to “fully covering the new COVID-19 shots, as required, with no cost sharing when consumers access them from a network provider or receive them through an out-of-network provider when in-network options are unavailable.” \nDotty Johnson was one of the many who couldn’t get the shot. She is a 73-year-old retired college professor in Pennsylvania. She recently completed chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, which places her at higher risk for more severe outcomes from COVID illness. For her and her husband, there is a sense of urgency to get the new monovalent shot.\nJohnson and her husband received the RSV vaccine in mid-September. At the time, the pharmacist told them CVS did not have the COVID vaccine yet and they should make an appointment to come back. The Johnsons made an appointment for this past Tuesday but received a text message the evening before saying CVS did not have the vaccine available the next day and they would need to reschedule. When Johnson checked online, there were no nearby appointments for the vaccine and the earliest appointment was the end of October.\nShe and her husband kept the Tuesday appointment to get the flu shot. But the CVS Medicare system was down, so they were given a choice – reschedule or pay out-of-pocket. They chose to pay $110 each for the flu vaccine. \nCVS recommended they keep calling to find out when the COVID vaccine will be available in their area. “I am immunosuppressed and over 65. My husband is 75 and he's in good health. He lives with me and so if he gets sick, I get sick, right?”\nCVS acknowledged some issues with its supply chain. \n“We’re receiving updated COVID-19 vaccines from suppliers on a rolling basis and most of our locations can honor scheduled appointments,” said Matt Blanchette, senior manager of retail communications for CVS Pharmacy. “However, due to delivery delays from our wholesalers, some appointments may be rescheduled. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will continue to offer additional appointments at those locations as supply is received.”\nIn New York City, Zoe Cohen and Levi Shaw-Faber had the same bad luck. In preparation for an upcoming wedding, the couple planned to get their shots a few days in advance. But one hour before their scheduled appointment for the updated COVID vaccine and flu shot, they got a call from CVS explaining that they had run out of doses. By the time Cohen and Shaw-Faber had started scrambling to find another availability that day, every pharmacy in the New York City area, besides one in New Jersey, was either booked up or run dry. \n“The good news is we’re in a different place than we were last year,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, said during a news conference Sept. 27 sponsored by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Cohen already had her flu shot and plans to get the COVID one as well. “Not only as CDC director, but as a mom, a wife, and a daughter, I wouldn’t recommend something for the American people that I would not recommend for my own family.” \nEven leading infectious disease experts face some challenges. Robert Hopkins Jr., MD, medical director of the infectious diseases foundation, for example, received his flu and COVID shots separately “because of availability,” he said at the news conference.\nA ‘Shaky’ Supply Chain\n“This is a total disaster. It's bad enough we've had pandemic fatigue and anti-science and everything else, but this rollout is just a curse,” said Eric Topol, MD, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, CA, and editor-in-chief of Medscape, WebMD’s sister site for health care professionals.\nThe COVID booster distribution chain is “really shaky,” Topol said, and supply levels are lower than many anticipated at this point. An unforeseen consequence is the “eager beavers” who normally get vaccinated in the first few weeks are not getting immunized.  \nThe situation is “just going to further undermine the public health agencies’ coordination in a post-emergency state pandemic management.”\nCohen said, “We’re about 2 weeks into having the new updated COVID vaccine, and it is a different process this year.” \nIn past years, the federal government purchased and distributed the COVID vaccines, so it was one system.

{"title": "Study: Fitness Matters More Than Weight Loss for Kidney Disease Risk", "date": "2023-10-02 16:40:03", "text": "Oct. 2, 2023 – Here's a better reason to work out than simply losing weight.\nHigher physical fitness and maintaining body weight lowered the risk of chronic kidney disease in adults with obesity, according to a study published Thursday in Obesity. But losing weight did not lower that risk. \n“We need to know more about the optimal strategies to reduce kidney disease risk in adults with obesity,” said study author Meera Harhay, MD, the medical director of clinical research at Drexel University in Philadelphia. \nObesity is a well-established risk factor for kidney disease, a leading cause of death in the United States. Hormonal changes related to extra body fat can increase body fluid volume, raise blood pressure, and promote insulin resistance. All that forces your kidneys to work harder to filter your blood, leading to damage and scarring. \n“The kidneys can only compensate so much before there is permanent damage,” said Harhay, an epidemiologist and a kidney transplant expert. \nIn the study, Harhay and colleagues used data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a National Institutes of Health initiative that followed 6,814 middle-aged adults in six U.S. cities, tracking their weight and other health measures over 10 years. From that pool, the researchers zeroed in on 1,208 adults who fit the medical definition of obese but did not start the study with kidney disease or diabetes (which can cause kidney disease).\nThey found that for every 11 pounds people gained, their risk of kidney disease shot up by 34%. But losing weight did not decrease the risk. This suggests that preventing weight gain may be more important than weight loss. \nUsing the participants’ self-reported walking pace as a measure of fitness, the researchers found that those who walked slower than 2 miles per hour were 57% more likely to get kidney disease than faster walkers.\nOnce scar tissue forms in the kidneys, that damage can’t be undone. But regular exercise may help the body survive that damage, the researchers surmised.\nHarhay said the benefit could be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of regular exercise and/or better health in the heart and blood vessels. “The mechanisms by which exercise and higher fitness are protective to the kidneys represent an important knowledge gap,” she said.\nBeyond Body Weight\nThe study reflects a growing trend in obesity research away from a focus on just body weight to looking into other things that may explain the link between obesity and disease.\n“For about 2 decades now, there has been in-depth research into what is the stronger factor for our longevity and disease risk,” said Matthew Ahmadi, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney, in Australia. “Is ‘fitness’ the primary driver, ‘fatness,’ or a balanced combination between the two?”\nIn a 2022 study co-authored by Ahmadi, people who walked at a faster pace had a 36% lower risk of dying during the study period (7 years) than those who walked more slowly. A 2021 study, from researchers at the University of Arizona, found that starting a regular exercise routine – whether it resulted in losing weight or not – countered the risk of early death linked to a high body mass index. \nIt’s important to note that heart-pounding workouts can pose complications for patients with kidney damage. Kidney disease is linked to muscle loss (sarcopenia) and the loss of muscle strength (dynapenia). As such, resistance training may be a good option. In fact, recent research suggests that resistance training may be better at improving walking speed in patients with sarcopenia than programs that also use other types of training.\n“A person with kidney disease should consult with their physician about their exercise goals,” said Harhay, who intends to explore how people with obesity and kidney disease can lose weight while maintaining muscle mass. \nSOURCES:\nMeera Nair Harhay, MD, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, Drexel University, Philadelphia.\nMatthew Ahmadi, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow, University of Sydney, Australia.\nDangers that can result from high blood sugar.\nPotentially serious physical effects of alcohol abuse.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

But building a retirement fund isn’t enough to prepare you for life after work. You need to consider the social and emotional aspects of retirement, too. “There's a tendency to think that the social side … is something that you can just do quickly once you've got the money part figured out,” says Wes Moss, managing partner and senior investment adviser for Capital Investment Advisors. “But it should be a lifelong pursuit to make sure that you've got all of the non-financial components in a good place when the time comes for you to stop working.”Many people don’t give much thought to these things ahead of time. An AARP survey found that 57% of retirees never planned for their emotional health, and 46% never thought about how they would remain fulfilled, once they stopped working.\nIn planning for retirement, you may have contributed to a 401(k), met with financial planners, and created a budget to make sure you could afford to leave the workforce.

But compared to some other races and ethnicities, Black or Hispanic people are less likely to have savings or supplemental insurance coverage to pay out-of-pocket costs to treat those health problems. \nAnd while many older people live on fixed budgets, people of color often face greater economic challenges and other barriers due to racism.But if you have financial problems, Jean-Jacques says, there’s no reason to hide that from your doctor. Your care team can help you find ways to cover your costs without interrupting your health care. “This is important because many people go years skimping on their medication and not taking it for several months or taking half-doses,” she says, “when actually they’re eligible for some support programs that would allow them to continue access to their medication and to do so more affordably.”Ask to speak with a social worker or health advocate at your hospital or doctor’s office.

In 2022, the annual cost of car ownership, including gas, maintenance, insurance, licensing, and registration, topped $10,000. Selling a second car could add up to big savings.Downsizing to a smaller home or moving to a less expensive area can also cut expenses and increase your budget for travel or other leisure pursuits.

{"title": "What It's Like to Live Well With Schizophrenia", "date": "2023-10-03 14:35:07", "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLisa Guardiola\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n“I like the fact that, through my work, I’ve been able to really break down the stigma,” says Lisa Guardiola, vice president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) affiliate in the south suburbs of Chicago. Guardiola, along with 20 million people worldwide, has schizophrenia. Through her recovery and volunteer work, she’s been able to inspire herself and others. “Even though I have a debilitating mental illness, I can live a productive life -- a fulfilling and happy life.”\nBut her road to recovery took time. From a young age, Guardiola remembers showing signs of schizophrenia. She heard voices, or auditory hallucinations. It was hard for her to socialize and form relationships.\nWhen her symptoms peaked after high school, Guardiola’s family checked her into a hospital. It was there, in 2004, that doctors diagnosed Guardiola with paranoid schizophrenia.\nSince then, Guardiola has been able to lead a successful life helping others manage symptoms of schizophrenia. “I derive a sense of pride from what I do. It gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of wonderful people in the community,” she says. “It has also provided me the opportunity to share my story.”\nAfter her first hospitalization, Guardiola attended different programs for support as she worked toward her goals. Here, she strengthened her coping skills, ability to form relationships, and medication routine. She learned to use her favorite hobbies, like drawing, journaling, and pottery, as ways to manage her symptoms.\nThis prepared Guardiola to go back to school and graduate with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and another in studio art.\nSince then, Guardiola has had other hospitalizations, but notes that they’re unlike her first. “The difference between my first hospitalization and my other hospitalizations is that I’m self-aware,” she says. “I know when I’m struggling, and it gives me the ability to know when to ask for help.”\nAs with many other conditions, recovery from schizophrenia isn’t linear. Even though you may be improving, you may still have moments where your symptoms get worse. Guardiola reminds herself and others to be patient as they heal. “It didn’t happen overnight. It takes practice and time,” she says. “Be forgiving of yourself.”\nCarlos Larrauri was always a good student. But when he attended college, he found himself obsessed with religious texts. He eventually began to hear voices, which he thought belonged to angels. Soon after, his grades started to slip, he ignored his hygiene, and began to show changes that were too extreme to be from the typical stress of university life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCarlos Larrauri\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn his early 20s, Larrauri’s doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia. Now, at the age of 33, he is a law student at the University of Michigan, a board-certified family nurse practitioner, a mental health advocate, and a volunteer with NAMI. “I’m achieving the goals I want to achieve. With that comes self-confidence and a sense of self-determination,” Larrauri says. “But it’s not easy. It’s still a difficult journey.”\nA healthy routine can maximize your recovery. There are many things you can do in addition to taking prescribed medication and talking to therapists to manage your symptoms.\nLarrauri and Guardiola both find that family and peer support help normalize their recovery. “I have a friend who also has the same lived experience,” Larrauri says. “That sense of camaraderie and bonding that we get through sharing our experiences is valuable.”\nPhysical activity, a good sleep schedule, advocacy, and self-education are just a few other things Guardiola and Larrauri use to lead a successful life. They also emphasize the importance of understanding the condition from a scientific standpoint. Learning about schizophrenia on a biological level can help you stay grounded during recovery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou have to take the reins of your recovery. It’s not a passive process.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlaying an active role in your mental health is also important. “It’s not like having a cast where someone puts it on for a couple months and they’re fine,\" Larrauri says. \nGuardiola points out that being an advocate for your health is crucial. She urges people to ask questions about their treatment and medication. If you’re able to learn more about your own care, you’ll be able to tell your doctors what works for you and what doesn’t.\"\nThrough their self-advocacy, Larrauri and Guardiola encourage others in their community to stay hopeful. “You have to have the belief that things can get better,” Larrauri says. “Even if there’s periods that are very thick with fog, or very dense and difficult.”\nLarrauri admits that he linked many biases and stereotypes to schizophrenia despite his decent knowledge of the condition. He believed his diagnosis was a death sentence and that he’d never reach his goals of living independently, creating meaningful work, or having relationships.\n“There’s so many misconceptions surrounding mental illness, especially one like schizophrenia,” Larrauri says. “Stigma is very real; it’s a barrier to care and quality of life.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“You are not to be feared. You are a person, an individual. You deserve the dignity and respect that every human being has. You’re more than your disability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhether it’s community discrimination or self-judgment, people with schizophrenia often develop issues with self-esteem and confidence.\nAfter her diagnosis, Guardiola didn’t want to be labeled. “You don’t want to reduce people to their diagnosis,” she says. “You want to make sure that you see the person first and not the diagnosis.”\nGuardiola and Larrauri believe that the best way to beat stigma is through conversation. When people share their stories, they break down barriers to understanding mental illness.\nYears ago, Guardiola remembers hardly hearing about celebrities with conditions like schizophrenia. Now, more people in the media share their stories. Not only does this dialogue normalize these conditions, but it also shows that individuals who live with them are able to overcome struggles and achieve great things.\nSOURCES:\nWorld Health Organization: “Schizophrenia.”\nCambridge University Press: “Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia: helping patients to develop effective coping strategies.”\nSchizophrenia Bulletin: “Recovery From Schizophrenia: With Views of Psychiatrists, Psychologists, and Others Diagnosed With This Disorder.”\nNHS: “Living with Schizophrenia.”\nCarlos Larrauri, nurse practitioner, Miami.\nLisa Guardiola, vice president, NAMI South Suburbs of Chicago.\nFamous faces you may recognize.\nBe aware of these warning signs.\nThe real truth on this condition.\nSymptoms of schizoaffective disorder.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

I taught school for over 30 years and began menopause during my teaching career. I was about 45 years old, and I remember seeing the afternoon teacher (I taught morning kindergarten) fanning herself while I too was fanning myself! After talking for a bit, we realized we were both going through menopause.At first, I didn’t connect my night sweats to menopause. I figured it was due to the tea I had before bed or that the house was just warm. I tend to be on the colder side, so being hot was different for me. I would even take my temperature, thinking maybe I was sick. \nI started menopause somewhat on the earlier side. I taught school for over 30 years and began menopause during my teaching career.

After talking for a bit, we realized we were both going through menopause.\nAt first, I didn’t connect my night sweats to menopause. I figured it was due to the tea I had before bed or that the house was just warm. I tend to be on the colder side, so being hot was different for me. I would even take my temperature, thinking maybe I was sick. \nInsomnia was also a challenge during that time. I thought it was from stress on the job or from just being a busy mom. I remember taking an allergy medication when I couldn’t sleep. Back then, they said you could take sinus medication if you needed to sleep. I’m not sure that’s what doctors recommend now, but it helped me.I was thankful because I had moderate hot flashes and night sweats, but they weren’t as bad as some of my friends. They actually weren’t as bad as my mother’s hot flashes, either. I recall seeing sweat drip down her face when she was going through menopause.I didn’t talk to my doctor a lot about my symptoms other than the time my period lasted 2  weeks. She put me on birth control for a while to get that stopped. She didn’t offer any other medications, but I don’t think I would have been open to them anyway. I didn’t want to use hormones because I had read about some of the side effects and risks.I’m thankful I didn’t have a long list of symptoms other than hot flashes, night sweats, and insomnia. My toughest symptoms were during my periods where I’d have terrible cramps, mood swings, and the full list. By the time menopause rolled around, I was somewhat happy to be done with periods and all that.\nInsomnia was also a challenge during that time.

By the time menopause rolled around, I was somewhat happy to be done with periods and all that.\nThose menopause days (and for me, it lasted about 3 years) were manageable because I kept busy. My students needed me. My family needed me. I had to take my sons around to various practices. Continuing to work helped me. It kept me occupied and kept my mind on other things. I also had the support of my husband and sons before, during, and after menopause. Having a support system has made a difference.At the end of the day, however, I know I have control over how I treat my body. I started getting somewhat serious about my health when I was younger. But, like a lot of people, I was inconsistent with working out and eating healthy. Right around the time I turned 60, I retired and found myself sitting around, feeling sorry for myself. Then, I told myself I’ve got to do something. I’ve got to make a change. Someone told me about CrossFit. I tried it, and I loved it! I started off with 2 days a week and increased to 4 days, all the way up until when the gym closed during the pandemic. I didn’t let that stop me. My son talked to me about an exercise bike, and I started using one. My husband and I got a rower. Sometimes life happens, and exercise is the last thing on my list, but I know how very important it is.\nThose menopause days (and for me, it lasted about 3 years) were manageable because I kept busy.

These are times when female hormones go up and down a lot, like before your period, after you have a baby, or around the menopause transition.When you go through menopause, your ovaries stop releasing eggs and make little to no estrogen. But hormone levels tend to fluctuate a lot during the 10 or so years before your period stops, otherwise known as perimenopause. “And we think it’s these hormonal shifts that cause anxiety more than the actual decline in estrogen,” Faubion says. Vasomotor symptoms, or hot flashes and night sweats, can also affect your mood in direct and indirect ways, says Hugh Taylor, MD, a menopause specialist and chair of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. \nMood changes tend to affect women during menstruation in what are called “windows of vulnerability,” says Stephanie Faubion, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health and medical director for the North American Menopause Society.

Some people get dizzy or have chest pain. You may also have a surge of adrenaline, a hormone “designed to make you a little anxious in a stressful situation,” Taylor says.Hot flashes can also wake you up at night. So not only are you having hormonal shifts that might affect your mood, now you’re sleep-deprived. And you might have a harder time managing stress if you’re tired or exhausted all the time.   If you add all these physical and emotional changes together, that makes menopause “a very stressful and anxiety-producing time,” Taylor says. \nWhen your body warms up suddenly, your heart might speed up as you start to sweat.

She also added more lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. “I felt 95% better just from changing my diet,” she says. \nPagano talked to her doctor about her physical and emotional menopause symptoms.

But the key is to find exercise that helps you feel good, Pagano says, which may change as you go through menopause. “I love to lift weights, and my body does not like to run,” she says. Take slow, deep breaths. Pagano feels calmer after she inhales slowly, holds her breath for a couple of seconds, and then lets out a nice long exhale. When she does this, her worst anxiety tends to pass within “three, four, or five breaths.” Meditate. With the help of the Headspace mindfulness training app, Pagano tries to meditate at least 10 minutes a day. The practice doesn’t get rid of her anxiety or worrisome thoughts. “It helps you not hold on to them,” she says. Consider dietary supplements. There’s some evidence black cohosh may ease depression and anxiety during menopause. You can discuss that supplement with your doctor. But after talking with a health professional, Pagano added a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, and magnesium to her daily routine. And while everyone is different, she says the herbal supplement ashwagandha helps boost her well-being. Studies show the root extract is safe and may help ease hot flashes, insomnia, and other perimenopause symptoms. \nExercise. Regular movement is good for the body and mind at any age.

{"title": "Survivorship Clinics a Crucial Part of Cancer Treatment", "date": "2023-10-03 16:10:14", "text": "Sept. 27, 2023 – When Amanda Hanley was a 21-year-old being treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, she met a friend for life.\n“Word travels in Rhode Island because Rhode Island is so small. A girl the town over was also in chemotherapy,” said Hanley, now 32. “She and I just got matching tattoos the other week.”\nTheir friendship has now endured more than decade. Hanley finished active treatment and eventually pursued her dream of becoming a veterinarian. In the interim, she got a therapist, traveled, struggled with alcohol, and endured a week of anxiety before every follow-up oncology appointment.\nWhen she moved back to Rhode Island in 2020 after veterinary school, her chemo buddy told her about the cancer survivorship clinic at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where Hanley was first treated.\n“I didn’t even know the survivorship clinic existed until I moved back up here,” Hanley said. “I really like the survivorship clinic because they know your history. It’s a different vibe.”\nGetting the word out about cancer survivorship resources is among the challenges the oncology field faces today, as well as innovating to meet the evolving needs of a more diverse population of cancer survivors.\nFor many types of cancer, treatments have become so effective that the disease is often now viewed as a chronic illness, and not necessarily a death sentence. Some doctors say it’s realistic to envision a day when cancer will be considered similar to conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes.\nThe time people live after a cancer diagnosis has increased so much that it has significantly impacted life expectancy for the average person in the U.S. Meanwhile, more people under age 50 are being diagnosed with cancer than ever before.\nIt all adds up to more than 18 million people in the U.S. living as cancer survivors.\nEach person has a quilt-like set of factors that tell a personalized cancer story, including age and current life circumstances, treatments, whether the disease is still detectable, and of course type and stage of cancer. There are more than 200 types of cancer.\n“It’s a massive group of people,” said Alicia Morgans, MD, MPH, medical director at the Adult Survivorship Program at Dana-Farber.\nEveryone diagnosed with cancer is considered a survivor from the day of diagnosis, which is a change from the perspective in the 1970s and 1980s, she said. Decades ago, the top concerns for cancer survivors were increased risk of heart problems or secondary cancers stemming from radiation and some chemotherapies.\n“Now we are really thinking more broadly about what’s important to people, including things like sleep and sexual health and psychological support and nutrition,” said Morgans.\nCancer survivors can have lifelong effects from the illness and its treatments, including fatigue, relationship challenges, financial impacts, and problems with mental health, sleep, and fertility.\nAt Dana-Farber, recent survivorship program innovations include specialized outreach to young cancer survivors, such as those who had testicular cancer or colorectal cancer.\n“Young patients can be higher-need and have different areas of emphasis,” Morgans said.\nBut not every cancer survivor will get a personal phone call well after treatment ends to offer support services. In many cases, the outreach is merely a poster in a cancer center cafeteria or an automated questionnaire sent on a patient portal, with responses then routed for follow-up, depending on how a survivor answers a set of questions.\nCancer survivors need to advocate for themselves about their ongoing needs, said Arif Kamal, MD, chief patient officer at the American Cancer Society and an oncologist at the Duke Cancer Center in Durham, NC. \n“Recognize that survivorship care is specialized care that needs a special set of skills and eyes and ears. The experience doesn’t end because chemotherapy is finished,” he said.\nPatients should feel the same amount of support and attention after treatment as during the treatment journey itself, Kamal said. \nFor Hanley, that means having someone skilled in examining her lymph nodes, since her cancer affected the lymphatic system. When she first went to her primary care doctor suspecting a serious illness, her concerns about dramatic weight loss and a lump in her neck were dismissed and linked to recently studying abroad in Costa Rica.\n“If I had just listened to my first primary care doctor and done nothing, I would be dead,” said Hanley, whose cancer was stage III at diagnosis.\nSeeing a provider such as a nurse practitioner at a survivorship clinic is kind of like have a point person for navigating medical care as a cancer survivor.\n“They’re removed from your oncologist, but they are adjacent to them. They are in between your oncology world and your primary care world,” Morgans said. “They can do follow-up for you. They can follow your yearly mammogram, for example.”\n“There’s no end date for survivorship,” she said. “You can stay there till you want to move on. You’re not kicked out.”\nThe level and type of ongoing support that cancer survivors want vary widely, and it’s OK to ask for more or for less, Kamal said.\n“There are some patients who say, ‘A once-a-year appointment is fine with me,’ and for other patients, they want to see me once a month to talk about what’s on their mind because for some, they worry,” he said. “The cancer may be gone, but the residual effects of it may still be around, and those are topics worth addressing.” \nConnecting survivors with helpful resources is an area that needs more attention in survivorship programming, said researcher Chloe Zimmerman, a medical and doctoral student at Brown University in Providence, RI. She was the lead author of a study published this summer that showed a Chinese mind-body practice called qi gong was similarly successful at treating cancer-related fatigue, compared to a traditional and more strenuous exercise program.\nOn average, women in the study still had significant levels of fatigue more than 4 years after completing active treatment.\n“Right now, the bigger issue is that many oncologists don’t think to recommend a post-treatment program,” Zimmerman said. “Most of our study participants had never even heard that fatigue was a thing they might contend with after treatment, so I think from an education perspective, the more survivor programs that are out there, the better.”\nSOURCES:\nAmanda Hanley, Hope, RI.\nCDC: “National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 71, Number 1, August 8, 2022.”\nJAMA Network Open: “Patterns in Cancer Incidence Among People Younger Than 50 Years in the US, 2010 to 2019.”\nIntegrative Cancer Therapies: “A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial Comparing Effects of Qigong and Exercise/Nutrition Training on Fatigue and Other Outcomes in Female Cancer Survivors.”\nAlicia Morgans, MD, MPH, medical director, Adult Survivorship Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.\nArif Kamal, MD, chief patient officer, American Cancer Society; associate professor of medicine, Duke University School of Medicine; oncologist, Duke Cancer Center, Durham, NC.\nChloe Zimmerman, medical and doctoral student, Brown University, Providence, RI.\nWhat you need to know.\nHow they work for blood cancers.\nSeparate fact from fiction.\nAnd how to best treat them.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Women Pay Billions More in Out-of-Pocket Health Costs a Year", "date": "2023-10-03 17:31:35", "text": "Oct. 3, 2023 – Marielle Farina, a senior manager at consulting and accounting firm Deloitte, has spent her career helping health insurers design their benefits. \nBut she was not prepared for the deluge of medical bills that arrived during the whirlwind of new motherhood.\n“Becoming a new mom is very overwhelming – you have a couple days of hospital stay, and then you take this baby home and try to figure out how to survive,” Farina said. “I remember a few weeks after having him, getting bill after bill after bill, and just adds to the sleepless nights and the stress of it all.”\nAs it turns out, maternity care is only the tip of the iceberg – women face higher medical costs than men even without factoring in childbirth costs, according to a new report from Deloitte, co-authored by Farina. \nThe report focused on working women, who analysts found pay as much as $15.4 billion more a year than men in out-of-pocket health care expenses. This spans age brackets, holding true for women 19 to 64.\nDeloitte's health team examined more than 16 million people under employer-sponsored coverage. The results were jarring – on average in 2021, women spent 20% more on out-of-pocket expenses, compared to men. Without maternity costs, it was still 18%, which translates to $266 more per year, on average.\nWhile the exact reasons for the differences are unknown, the report offered some likely reasons. Women use health care more often, with 10% more in total health expenditures, relative to men. Women have a need for specific checkups that men do not, including gynecological examinations, menopause-related visits, and high-cost breast cancer imaging. \nWomen also get less value for their dollars when it comes to health insurance, receiving about $1.3 billion less than men in the value of benefits among people with commercial insurance, the report says.\nAccording authors, the heavier financial burden for health services can be considered part of the “pink tax” – the price on products designed for women, like menstrual products. It is an issue that’s compounded by the pay inequity between men and women, they say. \nWomen – particularly Black, Native, and Latina women – make up nearly two-thirds of the nation’s workforce in low-paying jobs in industries like food service, retail, and housecleaning, according to a report from the National Women’s Law Center.  And these public-facing jobs came with especially high risk during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n“Women, Black women in particular, are overrepresented in these low-pay, high-risk jobs ,” said Venicia Gray, senior manager for maternal and infant health for the National Partnership for Women & Families, a research and advocacy group. “To hear that men don't pay as much is disheartening.”\nThere is research that points to lower-quality care for women in the doctor’s office. According to the 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation Women’s Health Survey, 29% of women ages 18-64 who have seen a health care provider in the past 2 years felt their doctors had dismissed their concerns.\nAlso, 15% reported that a provider did not believe they were telling the truth, and 19% said their doctor assumed something without asking.\nThis leads to less efficient and thorough medical care, forcing women to schedule extra appointments and spend more on out-of-pocket costs, said Malia Funk, founder of the POV, a women's health advocacy platform.\nFunk launched the POV in 2021, after it took eight doctor appointments over 3 years to have an out-of-place IUD removed that was causing pain, bleeding, and infections, she said. \nLike Farina, Funk had a background in the medical field, transitioning from pre-med studies to roles as a health care strategist and a private equity consultant. Despite her extensive experience, she wasn't prepared for the hurdles and costs that came with addressing what should have been a straightforward medical issue, she said.\nHer repeated appointments counted as “sick visits,” which she had to pay out-of-pocket toward her $4,000 deductible, she said. She was also charged $800 to rule out sexually transmitted infections, which she said was done without her knowledge during other testing. \n“As I was having these negative experiences, I was consulting some of the biggest health care companies,” Funk said. “I thought, ‘I know this space, and I still can’t figure out how to get good health care.’”\nKulleni Gebreyes, MD, an emergency medicine doctor and Deloitte's chief health equity officer, said she hopes the report will encourage employers and insurers to take a harder look at coverage structure. Business leaders should work with providers to determine why these discrepancies exist, she said, and to redesign benefits and cost-sharing. \n“Women aren't men with ovaries,” she said. “There are different medical needs, different burdens of disease, different behaviors. As we think about how to make health care more affordable, we need to make sure our health care benefit system takes that into consideration.”\nSOURCES:\nDeloitte: “Hiding in plain sight: the health care gender toll.”\nNational Women’s Law Center: “Hard Work Is Not Enough: Women in Low-Paid Jobs.”\n2022 Kaiser Family Foundation Women’s Health Survey.\nKulleni Gebreyes, MD, emergency medicine doctor; chief health equity officer, Deloitte.\nMarielle Farina, senior manager, Deloitte.\nVenicia Gray, senior manager for maternal and infant health, National Partnership for Women & Families.\nMalia Funk, founder, the POV.\nTest your knowledge.\nWhat causes them?\nLearn about your options.\nIs it menopause or something else?\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "How to Stop Nighttime Coughing", "date": "2023-10-03 19:03:34", "text": "What can feel more frustrating than having a cough? Having a cough that happens more often or gets worse at night. It affects how much you can relax, fall and stay asleep, and get much-needed rest for recovery. \n“During sleep, the body regulates our production of cytokines, signaling proteins our immune systems produce to fight off invading pathogens such as viruses and bacteria,” says Vontrelle Roundtree, MD, associate chief medical officer at MDLIVE of Evernorth. “If you have a nagging cough that causes you to wake up often throughout the night, it compromises sleep quality, potentially affecting your body’s cytokine regulation and making it difficult for your immune system to combat and recover from sickness.”\nNot only does coughing affect your ability to get over any illnesses that may cause the cough, but it may also cause you to have more symptoms that further affect your nighttime rest. “Coughing may also cause dry throat and mouth, postnasal drip, and physical discomfort that makes for a less-than-peaceful sleep experience,” Roundtree says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't give OTC cough medicine to children younger than 4. Honey can help calm coughs in kids older than 1 year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \nNighttime coughing can happen and feel worse for many reasons. It may be due to problems with your lungs and airways, such as infection, postnasal drip, allergies, and asthma. These can cause coughs that get worse at night, says Samuel Mathis, MD, assistant professor in the Department of Family Medicine at University of Texas Medical Branch. For instance, “with lung infections, lying down helps the cilia [little ‘hairs’ in our lungs] to more effectively move mucus out of the lungs, and the cough reflex is our body's attempt to get rid of the excess mucus,” he says. \nRoundtree says that “moving around during the day makes it easier for the body to loosen trapped mucus. When we lie down to rest at night, this position can make it more challenging for our bodies to naturally clear this mucus, resulting in what we call postnasal drip — nasal secretions that pool in the back of the throat and cause those pesky coughs.” \nNighttime coughs may also be a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux. “GERD happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining and potentially reaching the back of your throat,” Roundtree says. “The act of lying down can cause the reflux to get worse, and then, of course, you may cough more,” says Sarah McBane, PharmD, associate dean of pharmacy education at the University of California, Irvine School of Pharmacy. \n“To combat nighttime cough due to GERD, elevate your body at an incline to prevent the pooling of mucus, allowing for a more peaceful and less interrupted night's sleep,” she says. \nOther conditions that can cause coughing fits include heart failure and sleep apnea, Mathis says. \nYou may also have a nighttime cough when you’re taking medications such as ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure. These are known to have a dry cough as a side effect, Mathis says. \nOur body's circadian rhythm, the internal clock that helps manage important body functions (including sleep and immune response), may also play a role, Roundtree says. “Some parts of immune function are more active during the nighttime and into the early morning, which explains why you might feel your worst during those hours. While this natural response helps fight off the bacteria making you ill, it may also cause many of our sick symptoms during that time, such as congestion, fever, and increased nighttime coughing.”\nHow you manage your nighttime cough depends on how serious it is and what’s causing it, Roundtreee says. She advises seeing a doctor if your cough is constant, very bad, and comes with other concerning symptoms.\nIn the meantime, you can try this expert advice for managing mild coughs at night:\nIf these tips do not help with your cough, or if the cough lasts more than a couple of weeks, McBane advises seeing a doctor.\nRoundtree also recommends seeing a doctor if your cough lasts over a few days and you have other symptoms like chest pain, nausea, wheezing, or high fever. Mathis agrees, saying that if you cough up blood, have shortness of breath, and your legs or feet swell, you should be checked by a doctor. “They can help you identify the cause of your cough and treat the underlying issue.” \nSOURCES:\nJohn Hopkins Medicine: “GERD Diet: Foods That Help with Acid Reflux (Heartburn).”\nCleveland Clinic: “Is Eating Before Bed Bad for You?”\nVontrelle Roundtree, MD, associate chief medical officer, MDLIVE of Evernorth.\nSarah McBane, PharmD, associate dean of pharmacy education, University of California, Irvine School of Pharmacy. \nSamuel Mathis, MD, assistant professor, Department of Family Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch.\n15 tips to help you feel better.\nDo echinacea and vitamin C really help a cold?\nGet a good night’s rest with these remedies.\nEat these to fight colds, flu, and more.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Infographic: In 2023, Dementia Risks Are Everywhere, It Seems", "date": "2023-10-04 16:47:25", "text": "Oct. 4, 2023 – A lot of researchers are searching for risk factors that increase the chance someone will develop dementia or, specifically, Alzheimer’s disease. That’s good, because the more we know about potential risks, the more we may be able to prevent it. \nThere is no cure for dementia, and an estimated 10% of Americans over age 65 have it, including 6.7 million with Alzheimer’s disease. \nAnd, moving forward, these numbers are expected to rise. \nA treatment for early Alzheimer’s disease, lecanemab, was approved by the FDA this year, giving some people hope. But what about the “worried well,” people who are cognitively normal and would like to prevent dementia? \nWithout definitive studies to say, “This causes dementia,” investigators look for associations. It’s an early form of research that can reveal a link between a risk factor and dementia/Alzheimer’s. It doesn’t mean things like sleep apnea, constipation, or childhood nightmares definitely cause dementia. But these studies can help point future researchers in the right direction. \nWebMD and our sister site for health care professionals, Medscape, have published a number of these association studies since the beginning of this year.

{"title": "How Exercise Boosts Your Body’s Ability to Prevent Cancer", "date": "2023-10-04 20:03:34", "text": "Oct. 4, 2023 – Forty-five minutes of intense exercise three times a week may reduce cancer risk in patients with Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that can lead to cancer at a young age.\nThat amount of exercise made the immune system more able to stamp out cancer cells, researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center found. The intervention – 45 minutes of high-intensity cycling 3 days a week – was specific by design, said oncologist Eduardo Vilar-Sanchez, MD, PhD, a professor of clinical cancer prevention and the study’s lead author. \n“We wanted to be very concrete on the recommendation,” he said. “People don’t adhere to vague lifestyle advice like ‘just exercise.’ We wanted to link a specific biologic effect to a very concrete intervention.”\nThe study was small (just 21 people), but it builds on a vast body of evidence linking regular exercise to a decreased risk of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. But the MD Anderson researchers went a step further, investigating how exercise might lower cancer risk. \nExercise and the Immune System\nAll 21 people in the study had Lynch syndrome, and they were divided into two groups. One was given a 12-month exercise program; the other was not. The scientists checked their cardio and respiratory fitness and tracked immune cells – natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells – in the blood and colon tissues. \n“These are the immune cells that are in charge of attacking foreign entities like cancer cells,” Vilar-Sanchez said, “and they were more active with the participants who exercised.”\nPeople in the exercise group also saw a drop in levels of the inflammatory marker prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The drop was closely linked to the increase in immune cells. Both changes suggest a stronger immune response. \nThe researchers believe the changes relate to a boost in the body’s “immune surveillance” system for hunting down and clearing out cells that would otherwise become cancerous.\nBuilding on Prior Research\nScience already offers a lot of support that regular exercise can help prevent cancer. A massive 2019 systematic review of more than 45 studies and several million people found strong evidence that exercise can reduce the risk of several cancers – including bladder, breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers – by up to 20%. \nBut the MD Anderson study is the first to show a link between exercise and changes in immune biomarkers, the researchers said. “One thing is having the epidemiological correlation, but it’s another thing to know the biological basis,” said Xavier Llor, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study. \nTwo previous studies looked at exercise and inflammation markers in healthy people and in those with a history of colon polyps, but neither study produced meaningful results. This new study’s success could be due to the higher-intensity exercise or extra colon tissue samples. But also, advances in technology now allow for more sensitive measurements, the researchers said.\nWhat You Should Know\nVilar-Sanchez hesitated to extend the study findings beyond people with Lynch syndrome, but he’s optimistic that they may apply to the general population as well. \nLlor agrees: “Exercise could be protective against other types of cancer through some of these mechanisms,” he said.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, more than 15% of all cancer deaths (aside from tobacco-related cancers) in the United States are related to lifestyle factors, including physical inactivity, excess body weight, alcohol use, and poor nutrition. It recommends 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week to reduce cancer risk. People in the study saw a significant immune response with 135 minutes of high-intensity exercise a week. \n“The public should know that engaging in any form of exercise will somehow lead to effects in cancer prevention,” Vilar-Sanchez said.\nSOURCES:\nEduardo Vilar-Sanchez, MD, PhD, professor of clinical cancer prevention, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston.\nXavier Llor, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, Yale School of Medicine Cancer Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT.\nClinical Cancer Research: “Exercise Training Reduces the Inflammatory Response and Promotes Intestinal Mucosa-associated Immunity in Lynch Syndrome.”\nJournal of the National Cancer Institute: “Physical activity, body mass index, and prostaglandin E2 levels in rectal mucosa.”\nCancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention: “Effect of a 12-month exercise intervention on the apoptotic regulating proteins Bax and Bcl-2 in colon crypts: a randomized controlled trial.”\nDigestive and Liver Disease: “Features of colorectal adenomas among young patients with Lynch syndrome according to path MMR: Results from the PRED-IdF registry.”\n \nThe age people should begin getting routine screenings.\nWhat to expect when the cancer spreads to other areas.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Popular Weight Loss Drugs Raise Risk of More Stomach Trouble", "date": "2023-10-05 16:07:20", "text": "Oct. 5, 2023 – People taking popular medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus for weight loss are at higher risk for potentially serious stomach and intestinal issues, compared to people taking a weight loss drug approved in 2014, a large study reveals. \nThose taking one of these drugs, known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, were nine times more likely to have pancreatitis, an often painful inflammation of the pancreas, compared to others taking a combination of naltrexone and bupropion for weight loss (brand name Contrave). \nOther findings show that people taking these drugs: \nThe study was published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \nResearchers say their findings are not about scaring people off the weight loss drugs, but instead about increasing awareness that these potential adverse outcomes can happen. That way, people can consider the risks and benefits before starting these medications.\nRare But There\nPeople taking these drugs for weight loss have about a 1% to 2% chance of having these events, including a 1% risk for stomach paresis, said Mahyar Etminan, PharmD, the study’s senior author and an expert in drug safety and pharmacoepidemiology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.\nGiven the popularity and wide use of these drugs, these adverse events, although rare, “must be considered by patients thinking about using them for weight loss,” co-author Mohit Sodhi, a graduate of the University of British Columbia’s Experimental Medicine Program and fourth year medical student, said in a news release about the study.\nPeople taking a GLP-1 to treat diabetes might be more willing to accept the risks, Etminan said, given their potential advantages, especially for lowering the risk of heart problems. “But those who are otherwise healthy and just taking them for weight loss might want to be more careful in weighing the risk/benefit equation,” he said.\nStomach Blockage Warning\nThis is not the first report of GI issues linked to these medications, but it’s one of the largest. Most reports have been about a few people with stomach and other issues. \nThe FDA announced on Sept. 28 that it would require drugmakers to include a warning about intestinal blockages on the Ozempic label.\nRegarding ileus, the medical term for intestinal blockage, “this is yet another condition Ozempic users might experience,” said Steven Batash, MD, a leading doctor at the Batash Endoscopic Weight Loss Center in New York City. He was not involved in the study. \n\"There are a few GI conditions that are more likely among people using agents like Ozempic for weight loss, including a more rare side effect – gastroparesis, also known as stomach paralysis,” said Batash, a gastroenterologist with NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital, and New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in these medications, slows down digestion in the stomach and, in rare cases, can cause gastroparesis, he explained.\nThe new study’s findings are based on health insurance claim records for about 16 million U.S. patients. Sodhi and colleagues looked at people prescribed either semaglutide or liraglutide (Saxenda), two main GLP-1 agonists, between 2006 and 2020. FDA approval of GLP-1s for weight loss did not come until 2021, so the researchers also included people whose records showed a recent history of obesity. \nOne limitation of looking at medical records is the researchers were not able to confirm people were only taking semaglutide or liraglutide for weight loss. Some people may have been taking them for diabetes or both.\nSOURCES:\nMahyar Etminan, PharmD, MSc, University of British Columbia.\nSteven Batash, MD, Batash Endoscopic Weight Loss Center, New York City.\nJournal of the American Medical Association: “Risk of Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Associated With Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Weight Loss.”\n \nTest your knowledge of different types.\nWhat to know before taking them.\nAre they closer than you think?\nWhat to expect.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "Tripledemic? What CDC Recommends for COVID, Flu, and RSV", "date": "2023-10-05 16:49:44", "text": "Oct. 5, 2023 – As we forge ahead into fall and winter, the threat of a \"tripledemic\" – when cases of COVID-19, flu, and RSV surge at the same time – looms over our heads. \nLeading experts from the CDC on Wednesday met and addressed the three viruses that we’re faced with and how best to protect ourselves and others. \nIn the meeting, CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, said that clear, simple messaging is of the utmost importance right now: The most effective way to protect yourself from the worst of this season’s viruses is to get vaccinated. Everyone above 6 months old should get their flu shot and updated COVID vaccine; pregnant women and adults over 60 should get vaccinated against RSV. For all of these viruses, the month of October is the best time to get your shots to prevent infection down the line. \n“Coadministration of this vaccine along with influenza and COVID vaccines is completely acceptable,” said Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, the acting director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). “And it's important to remember that there's a good amount of overlap between the conditions that may increase risk for influenza and COVID and those that may increase risk for severe RSV disease as well.” \nGoing over the CDC’s updated recommendation list for all three vaccinations, Daskalakis said if you’ve already had a dose of the previous COVID vaccine, you should wait about 2 months before getting the updated one. If you’ve recently had COVID, the CDC guidelines say, you may consider waiting 3 months to get the new COVID shot.\nIn addition to the original vaccination series and a dose of the updated shot, Daskalakis said, those who are immunocompromised may receive more doses now depending on what their health care provider advises. \nWhen it comes to RSV in infants, Daskalakis pointed out that all babies qualify for nirsevimab, the monoclonal antibody treatment to protect against RSV. Another way to target newborns and infants is by getting pregnant people vaccinated 32-36 weeks into their pregnancy. \nWith all of these viruses, experts agreed that speed is the key for treatment. Getting tested as soon as you can, getting antivirals like Paxlovid for COVID-19 or those that target influenza, and masking if you’ve been exposed to a virus are all vital strategies to protect others from infection.\nSince the rollout of the updated COVID vaccine, there have been many reports of people struggling to get an appointment or having their appointments canceled at the last minute. Daskalakis and Nirav Shah, MD, JD, principal deputy director of the CDC, addressed these issues. \n“Public health distribution of vaccine is a lot different than commercial distribution of vaccine,” said Daskalakis, who said it took a year of planning to prepare for the switch. Despite reports, he said that every day the CDC is seeing an increase of vaccine supply come in for all providers, whether that be pharmacies or doctors’ offices. \n“Please don't give up on the vaccine, please know that the vaccine is available,” said Shah. “And please check back in with your provider, with your pharmacist because it's likely that if they didn't have the vaccine 2 weeks ago, they will have it now.” \nSOURCE: \nBriefing, Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States, Oct. 4, 2023.\n \nYou may not even know you have it.\nSigns of this potentially fatal complication.\nWhen a cold becomes bronchitis.\nCauses behind painful breathing, fluid buildup.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

{"title": "What Families Should Know About the New OTC Birth Control Pill", "date": "2023-10-06 16:47:56", "text": "Oct. 6, 2023 – The first over-the-counter birth control pill will hit U.S. stores early next year, which gives parents, teens, and their doctors time to decide how it will or could affect their lives.\nAnd the decisions are not always simple. \nThe FDA approved the oral contraceptive, called Opill, this summer. It will be available without a prescription and is a progestin-only daily birth control pill, as opposed to a combination pill containing estrogen and progestin. \nAccording to the drug’s maker, Perrigo, Opill – sometimes called the minipill – will be available for purchase online and in stores in the first quarter of 2024, for people of all ages without a prescription. And more pills are expected to come down the road: Cadence, another pharmaceutical company, is working on FDA approval for its OTC combination pill called Zena.\nAn OTC pill opens up a pathway for many to access contraceptive care when they couldn’t before. Getting an appointment, standing by for the day to come, taking time off work or school to make the visit – this process can sometimes take weeks, even months if your provider is slammed. An over-the-counter pill can be an option for those who are waiting on care from their OB/GYNs, while still needing protection against unwanted pregnancy. \nBut, if anyone can grab an Opill pack at their local drugstore, does this change the way parents, children, and their doctors will approach the birth control topic altogether? \nFor 16-year-old Maggie Cherkas, it might. She was raised by a single mother, Jill, outside Philadelphia, and their relationship is especially close. When she had her first serious boyfriend at 14, Jill “pitched” the idea of birth control to Maggie, who said she definitely did not need it at the time. \nTwo years later, Maggie, who now has a new boyfriend, is more interested in learning about which birth control options she has. \n“I do really like the idea of something that's over the counter,” Maggie said. “I feel like it would be kind of just be a whole process going to my doctor and having to get a prescription, always having to do that when I could just go to CVS and pick it up like any other cosmetic.” \nWhat gives Maggie pause is the questions she has for her doctor. She’d also like to know what questions her mom has – as Jill has been on the pill for years – that Maggie wouldn’t have even thought to ask. That’s why it’s highly unlikely that she’d go out and start Opill on her own, without first talking it through with her mom and doctor. \nSarah Nosal, MD, a family medicine doctor based in New York City and director of the American Academy of Family Physicians’ board of directors, said that when Opill hits the shelves, she plans to talk about it, with both parents and kids, the way she would with any other OTC medication on the market. \n“Just like we talk about whether or not you should be taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen – if it's right for you, if we need to be worried about side effects, how do you take it best to make it work for what we're planning to use it for,” she said. “Those same conversations, but about the progestin-only pill.” \nResearch shows that the progestin-only pill is safe to use and offers very few health risks. With “perfect use” – taking the pill at the same time each day – the efficacy rate is as high as 98%. \nStill, Nosal does understand the worries some parents might have going into these conversations. The minipill isn’t usually the first type of oral contraceptive that doctors prescribe for reproductive-age kids. \nTaking into consideration human errors and everyday forgetfulness, real-world use of both the combination and progestin-only pill is less effective at preventing pregnancy than with perfect use. But when it comes to the progestin-only pill, there is even less wiggle room. If you skip a pill or take one more than 3 hours late, you’ll need to use a backup birth control method for at least 2 days. \n“To be fair, for OB/GYNs, it’s not typically the first line of defense. First line really is that traditional combined birth control pill,” said Ryalynn Carter, MD, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. For Carter and most of her colleagues, the most common time to prescribe a progestin-only pill would be for postpartum patients, particularly those who are breastfeeding. \nHow Much Will It Cost? \nWe don’t yet know how much a single pack of OTC birth control pills will cost. In a statement, Perrigo emphasized its commitment to making Opill “accessible and affordable to women and people of all ages.” \nWhether or not insurance will extend coverage to Opill is also a major concern. Some forms of OTC contraception, like condoms, aren’t covered; but depending on your health insurance plan, you actually may be able to get Plan B (the morning-after pill) for free if you get a prescription from a health care provider. \nSo far, six states have passed laws that require government-funded health insurance plans to cover OTC birth control without cost-sharing. But what insurance coverage of OTC contraception will look like in practice still poses many questions for patients, pharmacists, and insurers. \nA major concern for Carter and other providers like her is whether having an OTC birth control pill option will impact insurance companies’ willingness to cover other forms of contraception without first forcing a patient to try – and fail – with the OTC progestin-only pill. \nShe recalls that when Prilosec, a brand of proton pump inhibitor used to treat acid reflux, became available over the counter, there were reports of insurance companies refusing to cover the more expensive, non-OTC options in the same drug class unless a consumer had already tried the OTC version. Carter worries the same could happen with contraception; maybe insurers will withhold coverage of intrauterine devices (IUDs) or the birth control patch until a patient tries Opill first. \nEven if both public and private insurance plans find a way to cover Opill and the other OTC oral contraceptives that are expected to follow its lead, there are still uninsured people and those under someone else’s insurance – like a partner or parent – who need the pill to be accessible, affordable, and confidential.\nThe OTC progestin-only pill is an option for a teenager, or anyone under their parents’ plan, to access contraception without alerting insurance. It’s also an important option for those experiencing “contraceptive sabotage,” said Seattle-based pediatric and adolescent gynecologist Anne-Marie Amies Oelschlager, MD. \n“Maybe there’s a patient who is in an abusive relationship where a significant other was trying to coerce them into not using contraception, they could use this form of contraception without alerting their partner,” she said. “It’s more common than you would think.” \nAnd despite the closeness that Maggie has with her mom, Jill feels a sense of discomfort around the OTC pill having no age requirements. \n“I would not love it if my daughter could obtain it without my knowing,” said Jill. “We’re pretty open, but she wouldn’t mind avoiding an uncomfortable conversation if she could. … I do think you should be 18 or have parent permission.” \nWhile Carter doesn’t believe that the availability of Opill will change her patient volume, she does suspect that it will change the way visits might go with younger patients. \n“I do think that every now and again, when Mom steps out of the room, their daughters will look at me and say, ‘I’m actually on this pill that I got at Target,’” said Carter. “That’s my chance to catch them and say, that’s great, but it doesn’t prevent STDs and you have to know that.” \nSOURCES: \nFDA: “FDA Approves First Nonprescription Daily Oral Contraceptive,” “Opill (0.075mg Oral Norgestrel Tablet) Information.”\nCadence OTC.\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association: “Contraception Selection, Effectiveness, and Adverse Effects.”\nNational Library of Medicine: “Contraindications to Progestin-only Hormonal Contraceptives.”\nMayo Clinic: “Choosing a birth control pill.”\nPerrigo: “Perrigo Announces U.S. FDA Approval for Opill OTC Daily Oral Contraceptive.”\nKaiser Family Foundation: “State Private Insurance Coverage Requirements for OTC Contraception Without a Prescription.”\nMaggie Cherkas, Pennsylvania.\nJill Cherkas, Pennsylvania.\nSarah Nosal, MD, family medicine doctor; director, board of directors, American Academy of Family Physicians, New York City. \nRyalynn Carter, MD, obstetrician-gynecologist, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City. \nAnne-Marie Amies Oelschlager, MD, pediatric and adolescent gynecologist, Seattle.\nTake this quiz.\nHere's what to expect.\nHere's what to do next.\nWhat you should know to prevent pregnancy.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.

Since ADPKD progresses relatively slowly, it gives patients some time to prepare, he notes.\nWhen your GFR gets down to around 20, Uribarri recommends that you talk to your doctor about placing a fistula. In this surgery, an artery is joined to a nearby vein under your skin to make a bigger blood vessel. This creates an access point for the dialysis machine. “We like to do this 2 to 3 months before the first session of dialysis, since it can take several weeks for the fistula to heal and become sturdy enough to withstand thrice-weekly dialysis treatments,” he explains.If you don’t have a vein large enough for a fistula, your doctor can create an artificial vein and install it surgically. If you need to begin dialysis right away, your doctor can insert a dialysis catheter in your neck or chest as a short-term solution. But, if possible, you want to avoid this method. “I had to change out my catheter four times over a 5-month period because it wasn’t working properly,” says Dawn Cleeton-Lewis, a 37-year-old fraud investigator in Fort Worth, TX, who began dialysis in March after she went into kidney failure.\nWhen your GFR gets down to around 20, Uribarri recommends that you talk to your doctor about placing a fistula.

This is when a machine removes blood from your body, filters it through a dialyzer (artificial kidney), and returns the cleaned blood to your body. It takes anywhere from 3 to 5 hours and is done three times a week. “I generally spend the first hour on my phone, then I sleep the rest of the time because I feel so exhausted,” says Cleeton-Lewis.You may have side effects during or after hemodialysis. These include:Low blood pressureNauseaDizziness or faintingHeadachesItchy skinMuscle crampsRestless legs syndromeSince in-center hemodialysis takes a lot of time, you may also need to speak to your employer about changing your work hours. Cleeton-Lewis has it down to a science. “The 3 days a week I do dialysis, I go from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., then I’m at my desk doing work from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.,” she says. “Some days, especially at the beginning when I was just getting used to dialysis, I couldn’t make it that long, so I would lie down for a nap in the midafternoon for about an hour.”\nMost people who go on hemodialysis end up doing in-center hemodialysis at a hospital or dialysis center, says Uribarri.

Since it’s easier to fit treatments into your daily schedule, you may be more likely to do it, says Uribarri. There’s some evidence that home hemodialysis allows you to take less medication to control complications of kidney disease like high blood pressure or anemia, have fewer side effects, and have a better quality of life overall. But you will need training so you can safely do it at home. There are three main types:Conventional home hemodialysis: You do this three times a week for 3 to 4 hours at a time.Short daily home hemodialysis: This is done five to seven times a week for about 2 hours each session. Since you’re doing it more frequently, less fluid needs to be removed. This reduces side effects.Nocturnal home hemodialysis: These treatments are done while you sleep most nights of the week for 6 to 8 hours, which can result in more waste removal.Very rarely, you may get complications from hemodialysis, says Uribarri. These include an infected AV fistula or graft, or a blockage from scar tissue. The dialysis needle can also fall out of your arm, but an alarm will go off to alert you or medical staff to the problem.\nAnother option is home hemodialysis.

These include:Limit salt intake. This may help control your blood pressure. It may also keep you from retaining fluids between dialysis sessions.Eat more protein.

Warejko explains that a faulty gene on a non-sex chromosome causes ADPKD. That means that whether your child is male or female, there’s a 50% chance they’ll get this mutated gene from you. And if they have the disease, there’s a 50% chance they’ll pass it on to their kids.\nIf your kids are teenagers or young adults, you can break down the basics of this autosomal dominant genetic disease.

But use age-appropriate terms that aren’t scary.“You don’t want kids to be fearful,” Warejko says. “Fear can make people not want to go to the doctor.” In her practice, Warejko describes ADPKD like this:“It sounds like a couple of family members have had this illness called kidney disease. And the reason you’re visiting with me today is because we want to make sure that, if you have kidney disease too, we’re doing everything in our power to make sure you stay as healthy as possible.”She also tells kids that it’s best to treat this disease early, when their kidneys are “good” and still work like normal. And the best way to do that, she says, is to “make sure that you’re checking in with us.”\nYou may need to give younger kids less information. You can still bring up ADPKD.

{"title": "This Could Be an RSV Season Like No Other, in a Good Way", "date": "2023-10-10 18:20:01", "text": "Oct. 10, 2023 – Any parent whose baby has been hospitalized will never forget the emotions, sights, and sounds experienced while at their child’s bedside. \nThe number of parents who go through that may dramatically drop forever, and this year, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may end its run of at least 15 years as the top cause of hospitalization among infants.\nFor the first time, two preventive treatments are available that dramatically reduce the risk of severe RSV. One is a maternal RSV vaccine given toward the end of pregnancy, and a second option is a shot of protective antibodies given to babies as early as the first week of life. Both are about 80% effective at preventing severe complications from RSV.\nMedical providers and public health experts are hopeful there will be strong acceptance of the maternal RSV vaccine. The maternal vaccine works just as well and is just as safe as the monoclonal antibody shot that can be given to infants, but is more available and is less than half the cost. \nJessica Ehrig, MD, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in central Texas, wishes the option had been available when she was pregnant with her first child 8 years ago because it may have prevented her daughter’s stay in the pediatric intensive care unit with RSV. As a doctor, she knew just how dangerous the illness was when she saw that her daughter’s blood oxygen level was in the 80% range as they rode in the ambulance to the hospital. A child’s normal blood oxygen level is 93% to 97%.\n“I hope no momma has to be there watching their baby be in distress,” she said. “That terror and that experience – I would have done anything to prevent that.”\nAbout 2 of every 100 babies born in the U.S. are hospitalized due to RSV within the first year of life. It’s so common that most people know someone whose child had a severe case, or perhaps they recall the most stressful days of their own parenthood at their baby’s bedside in the hospital.\nThe new maternal RSV vaccine is 82% effective at preventing severe complications from RSV within the first 3 months of life, and remained 69% effective at the 6-month point, according to data from the FDA. In August, the FDA approved the shot to be given between weeks 32 and 36 of pregnancy. CDC guidelines say it should be given from September through January, when RSV peaks.\nRSV can lead to a condition called bronchiolitis, which causes the small airways in the lungs to swell and results in wheezing and coughing that is exhausting. Babies who are hospitalized may need fluids and a tube guided into the windpipe to help them breathe.\nSo far this season, RSV detections are ticking up, but the rate is far from last season’s early onslaught that was part of the “tripledemic” of respiratory illnesses. As of the week ending Sept. 30, there were about 900 cases of RSV reported to the CDC nationwide. At the same time last year, there were nearly 6,000 cases. Any RSV case count reductions so far this year are unlikely to be due to the new medicines, since they are just now becoming available.\nWhether it’s a big RSV season or a typical one, RSV “is by the far the most common reason to be in the hospital the first few months of your life,” said Kevin Ault, MD, who serves on the Immunization Working Group of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The professional group immediately announced it “unequivocally supports” the recommendation made by the CDC on Sept. 22 that all pregnant people get the maternal RSV vaccine if they are midway through their third trimester during RSV season.\nEarly Demand Is Strong\nDespite a rising rate of vaccine hesitancy nationwide, there are some signs of potentially strong interest in the new maternal RSV vaccine. \n“The local pharmacies in town have it, and they’re seeing increasing demand with it,” said Ehrig, the maternal fetal medicine director at Baylor Scott & White Health Memorial Hospital in Temple, TX. “They’re running out and having to place larger orders. I think they were hesitant as to how much to order at first, but it seems like most moms are interested.”\nEhrig and Ault have both had pregnant patients request the vaccine already.\n“I think uptake is going to be pretty good,” said Ault, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western Michigan University Homer Stryker MD School of Medicine in Kalamazoo. “There’s a very similar strategy for whooping cough, or pertussis. That strategy has worked amazingly well.”\nThe whooping cough vaccine, included in the shot known as Tdap, was recommended for all pregnant people starting in 1996 by the same CDC advisory group that just recently added the maternal RSV vaccine to its recommended list. The two are similar because they are given during pregnancy and can protect from disease right at birth.\n“The strategy is we give Mom an injection, the mom makes antibodies, the antibodies go through the placenta and go to the fetus, and then they’re born with their protection,” Ault explained.\nBefore the Tdap vaccine, about 200,000 cases of whooping cough occurred in the U.S. annually. That number dropped to 5,000 cases in 2020, when just over half of pregnant people got the Tdap shot, according the Mayo Clinic.\nThe addition of the maternal RSV shot now makes four recommended vaccines for pregnant people: Tdap, flu, COVID-19, and RSV. Infectious diseases professor William Schaffner, MD, of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, is anxiously watching to see whether the new maternal RSV vaccine will be immune to the nation’s growing vaccine hesitancy.\n“I would be concerned about that, and I hope that I’m wrong,” he said. “The early accepters – the people who are out there wanting to get this vaccine – I hope they are thought-leaders in their communities, in their local group of friends, and among pregnant people who talk to each other and share experiences.” \nRecent survey data shows that Tdap vaccination rates have remained relatively steady in recent years, while flu and COVID shot acceptance has varied.\nDuring the 2022-2023 season:\n“In my patient population, patients that are anti-COVID vaccine are actually more interested in getting the RSV vaccine,” Ehrig said. “They’ve seen babies of friends or family members who had it, or their own baby from a prior pregnancy had it and they want to try to prevent that for their unborn child.”\nNot One, But Two Safe Options\nIn its approval, the FDA noted that the new maternal RSV vaccine clinical trials included some potentially elevated rates of preterm births and of a serious type of high blood pressure during pregnancy called preeclampsia. \nBoth Ault, who temporarily sat on the CDC’s advisory committee that reviewed some of the maternal RSV data in May, and Ehrig said that a close look at the clinical data for those potential risks does not raise any safety flags for them. Ehrig said the preeclampsia rate was actually below that of the general population, and elevated rates of preterm births mainly occurred in countries with prenatal care that is not equal to the level of care in the U.S.\nThe protection from the vaccine, which is made by Pfizer under the brand name Abrysvo, lasts about one season. For mothers who don’t get the vaccine during pregnancy, there is another new protection option that can be given as a shot to a baby as early as within the first week of life and is approved for all babies up to 8 months of age. The shot for babies contains monoclonal antibodies and is about as effective as the maternal vaccine. Some high-risk babies up to 19 months old will also be able to get the monoclonal antibody shot.\n“They’re both giving the same thing to babies, which we call passive immunity,” Ehrig said. “The baby doesn’t have to make its own antibodies because we’re giving it antibodies. Either from Mom or from monoclonal antibodies, essentially they both work the same way as far as protecting babies.”\nBut most providers are hearing there will be a limited supply of the monoclonal antibody medicine, at least for this season, so maternal vaccination will be an important option since there won’t be enough monoclonal antibody shots to go around. For people who have to pay out of pocket, the monoclonal antibody treatment costs $495, while the maternal RSV vaccine costs $295, according to the CDC. \nMost private insurers will cover the costs of the maternal RSV vaccine, and options exist for those without insurance.\nIn addition to the potentially high cost, another concern raised in the medical and public health communities is that having one option that occurs before birth and one that occurs after could challenge already difficult lines of communication between prenatal care providers and pediatricians. \nAdd vaccine hesitancy to the list of challenges for these breakthrough RSV medicines, and the communities of prenatal care, pediatrics, infectious diseases, and public health are all anxiously hoping that in this RSV season, children’s hospitals nationwide will report the most unused beds in history.\nSOURCES:\nJessica Ehrig, MD, maternal fetal medicine director, Baylor Scott & White Health Memorial Hospital, Temple, TX.\nKevin Ault, MD, professor and chair of obstetrics and gynecology, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker MD School of Medicine, Kalamazoo; Immunization Working Group member, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\nWilliam Schaffner, MD, professor of infectious diseases, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville.\nCDC: “RSV National Trends,” “Healthcare Providers: RSV Vaccination for Pregnant People,” “Influenza and Tdap Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women – United States, April 2020,” “Influenza, Tdap, and COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage and Hesitancy Among Pregnant Women – United States, April 2023,” “COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant people aged 18-49 years overall, by race and ethnicity, and date reported to CDC – Vaccine Safety Datalink, United States,” “Maternal RSV Vaccine Implementation Considerations.”\nThe Journal of Infectious Diseases: “Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Rates among US Infants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.”\nMayo Clinic: “History of whooping cough: Outbreaks and vaccine timeline.”\nFDA: “FDA Approves First Vaccine for Pregnant Individuals to Prevent RSV in Infants.”\nYou may not even know you have it.\nSigns of this potentially fatal complication.\nWhen a cold becomes bronchitis.\nCauses behind painful breathing, fluid buildup.\n © 2005 - 2023 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.
