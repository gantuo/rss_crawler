{"title": "Stevie Nicks Says ‘Daisy Jones & The Six’ Captured the “Snappy Sarcasm” Between Her and Fleetwood Mac Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham", "date": "2023-10-02 23:19:09", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\n\"It was so real,\" the music legend said. \"I would be watching and be like, 'Well, there you go.' That’s exactly why we did it. That’s exactly why Fleetwood Mac stayed together for 50 years.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tAbbey White\n\nAssociate Editor & News Writer\n\nStevie Nicks is elaborating on why Prime Video hit Daisy Jones & The Six had her feeling “like a ghost watching my own story.”\n\n\tIn a new interview with Vulture, the Fleetwood Mac singer discussed how the show’s stars Riley Keough and Sam Claflin captured the essence of her creative relationship with fellow Fleetwood Mac member Lindsey Buckingham. The interview follows Nicks tweeting her response to the show, which was adapted from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel, while watching the series back in August. Reid has previously said that she pulled from several ’70s bands for inspiration, including Fleetwood Mac. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow 'Daisy Jones & The Six' Casting Directors Made the Band, One Member at a Time\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Daisy Jones & the Six' Showrunner on a Possible Real-Life Concert With the Cast: \"Everyone Involved Really Wants It\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhile discussing the eerie similarities between her own life and what she was seeing onscreen, Nicks pointed to one specific element of Keough and Claflin’s dynamic as the biggest reason why she saw herself in their relationship. \n\n\t“It was a very simple thing. It was the kind of snappy sarcasm between Daisy and Billy, who in my mind was like me and Lindsey,” she explained. “It was the back-and-forth between the two of them. It was so good. It was so real, and it was really so right on.”\n\n\tNicks added that it wasn’t the looks that either actor brought forth for their characters that made her see herself and Buckingham in the show. Instead, it was the electric and magnetic energy Keough and Claflin brought forth, particularly in those charged moments between their characters Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne. \n\n\t“When two people capture the essence of something that reminds you of your life, it’s not like you go, ‘They look just like us,’ or ‘They dress just like us.’ It’s something else. It’s a certain feeling that they got when they would look at each other after being in an argument, and then they’d start to sing. It would blow your mind,” she said.\n\n\t“I would be watching and be like, ‘Well, there you go,'” she continued. “That’s exactly why we did it. That’s exactly why Fleetwood Mac stayed together for 50 years. It was all for the music. It was all just to keep the music going, and the show got it.”\n\n\tNicks also shared her favorite lyric from the fictional band’s catalog before lauding Keough and Claflin for their vocal performances, despite both admitting that they’d had little vocal training going into the show. For Nicks, the performances were impressive enough she’d consider signing the duo as a real band. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“My favorite is the one that goes, ‘We could make a good thing bad.’ That was my favorite,” Nicks said, referring to the “Honeycomb” track. “If it was another time, another day, and there had never been a Fleetwood Mac and I had watched that, and I was a record A&R person, I would’ve said, ‘We need to call them now. We need to sign them now.’ I really felt that. Considering that it seems like neither of them sang much before this, they did an amazing job.”\n\n\tAt another point in the interview, the Fleetwood Mac singer expressed that she doesn’t think there’s a return for the chart-topping, genre-smashing band following member following Christine McVie’s death in November 2022 at 79.  \n\n\t“When Christine died, I felt like you can’t replace her. You just can’t. Without her, what is it?” the singer reflected. “We were on our own in that band. We always were. We protected each other. Who am I going to look over to on the right and have them not be there behind that Hammond organ? When she died, I figured we really can’t go any further with this. There’s no reason to.”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Draws Trademark Lawsuit From Social Media Ad Agency", "date": "2023-10-03 00:11:26", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nX Social Media says it has used the \"X\" mark to advertise services identical to those offered by X Corp. for at least eight years. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tWinston Cho\n\n\n\tX Corp. has been sued for copyright infringement, wrongful termination and employment discrimination since Elon Musk acquired the company known as Twitter less than a year ago. Trademark infringement can now be added to its list of legal troubles, with the filing of a lawsuit from an advertising agency.\n\n\tThat ad agency, X Social Media, on Monday sued X Corp. in Florida federal court, arguing that the rebrand has confused consumers by leading them to believe that the company’s ad services are associated with the Musk-led company. It seeks an order that would block X Corp. from continuing to use its mark and treble damages for “exceptional” infringement.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLinda Yaccarino Defends Elon Musk in Tense Interview About Twitter's Transformation Into X\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLarry David Confronted Elon Musk Over GOP Support After Uvalde Shooting: \"Do You Just Want to Murder Kids?\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe change from Twitter to X Corp. was made in July as part of Musk’s plans to expand the social media service into an “everything app.” But at the time of the announcement, there were nearly 900 trademark registrations covering the letter “X” across various industries. That included one belonging to Meta for social networking services in entertainment and another belonging to Microsoft for gaming. \n\n\tX Corp. has filed to register “X” for use in association with social media, business data analytics, market research and advertising services, among various other areas. X Social Media, however, says it has used the mark in identical and closely-related services for over eight years.\n\n\t“They also encompass services and market channels where X Social Media has labored for years to successfully cultivate brand awareness for its X SocialMedia Mark among consumers,” states the complaint, which describes the business as utilizing social media to connect consumers with legal services.\n\n\tThis allegedly infringing, overlapping use of the “X” mark has led to the perception that X Corp. is the source for services offered by X Social Media, the company claims. As “X” is a social media platform, “consumers naturally conflate” the two companies, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\tX Social Media says it frequently emphasizes the “X” portion of its mark in advertising, blogs and newsletters, which are named “The X Blog” and “X Weekly,” according to the complaint. It says it has invested over $400 million in advertising, over $2 million of which was to build brand awareness.\n\n\tThe company advertises its services under the federally registered trademark “X SocialMedia” for use in association with advertising services. It says it’s exclusively used the mark since at least 2016, entitling it “to a presumption of incontestability.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe lawsuit claims X Corp.’s adoption of “X” exemplifies exceptional willful conduct since it had a “legal duty to conduct due diligence and avoid infringing” on existing marks. X Social Media allegedly sent a cease-and-desist in August but was ignored.\n\n\t“In a short time, X Corp. has wielded its social media clout, marketing resources, and overall national notoriety to dominate consumer perception of its ‘X’ mark,” the complaint states.\n\n\tX Social Media claims trademark infringement, as well as violations of Florida competition and unfair trade practices laws.\n\n\tTo win the case, X Social Media will have to show that consumers are being confused by X Corp.’s use of an identical mark. The court will assess the degree of similarity of the marks and the proximity in the services offered by the two companies, among other factors. \n\n\tThe company formerly known as Facebook was also sued last year when it rebranded to Meta. Virtual reality company MetaX accused the company of purposely stealing its name as part of its pivot to the metaverse.

Monday marked the first time that the parties had been back at the negotiations table since the actors’ strike began in mid-July. \n\n\n\n\tSome of the industry’s biggest leaders — Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Disney CEO Bob Iger, and NBCUniversal Studio Group chairman and chief content officer Donna Langley — returned to the bargaining table with SAG-AFTRA on Monday, after the same group helped expedite the Writers Guild of America talks in late September. In a change of pace, the CEOs met with the union on the labor group’s home turf, at the SAG-AFTRA national headquarters on Wilshire Blvd., without any federal mediators present. When negotiations initially broke off on July 12, the two sides had been meeting at the AMPTP offices in the Sherman Oaks Galleria and had brought in Federal Mediation & Conciliation Service professionals for one day.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Says He's \"Furious\" at Studios for Prolonging the Writers Strike\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRobin Williams' Daughter Zelda Criticizes Use of AI to Re-create His Voice: \"I Find It Personally Disturbing\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe leaders’ presence in the room raised hopes around the business that the renewed SAG-AFTRA negotiations could move quickly from this point on. Those expectations will likely not be quelled by Monday’s joint statement from both management and labor, which is a positive sign, usually signaling at least some measure of cohesion within the negotiation room.\n\n\tStill, Monday’s round of negotiations occurred more than 80 days into the actors’ strike, as SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP still have many outstanding issues to resolve. Wage increases, a revenue-sharing proposal on streaming titles and regulations for A.I. remain top priorities for the union that have yet to be fully addressed. The union has also pushed an array of smaller items that it has not yet settled with studios, like increases to health plan and pension contribution “caps,” the size of relocation expenses and whether performance-capture work can be covered under the union’s TV/theatrical contract.\n\n\tIn a separate message to members on Monday, SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating committee urged performers to “not let up.” The committee continued, “Keep turning out in full force on our picket lines and at solidarity events around the country. Let the AMPTP hear your voices loud and clear. It makes a difference. YOU make a difference.” The union leaders also said that the group would remain out on strike “as long as it takes.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

The Writers Guild last week voted to end the strike while the deal was being ratified.\n\n\tMeanwhile, SAG-AFTRA is still on strike but resumed negotiations with the AMPTP on Monday, with the two sides expected to talk again on Wednesday.\n\n\tDue to the writers’ strike ending, Cooper’s co-writer Josh Singer, who skipped the Venice world premiere for Maestro, was able to attend the NY Film Festival event and spoke with media outlets on the red carpet and participated in a post-screening Q&A.\n\n\tSpeaking to THR about the end of the writers strike prior to Monday’s screening, Singer said he was grateful to the WGA negotiators “who I think worked very hard and bravely fought to put in protections for writers for many years to come.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHe added, “And I’m also grateful that it’s over and I get to stand here today and talk about a movie I’ve been working on for 9 years.”\n\n\tSinger added that he was hopeful for a speedy resolution to the actors strike.\n\n\t“I know there are different issues [with the actors than with the WGA], but I’m hopeful just so the town can get working again,” he said. “But I think actors need to get the protections they want.”\n\n\tWhen asked he and his fellow producers felt about debuting Maestro amid the ongoing actors strike, producer Fred Berner indicated he was hopeful a resolution would be coming soon. \n\n\t“I’m just sad I can’t hug all of these folks and celebrate,” he said. “We will hopefully have an opportunity. I’m starting to think it’s beginning to thaw a little bit.”\n\n\tHe added, “I think it’s worse for [the actors] than it is for us. How can you put all of that time and energy and love into something and not be able to stand there and get a smidgen of it back?”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

With a tentative agreement in hand, the guild called an end to the strike last week, which allowed ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live, CBS’ Late Show With Stephen Colbert and NBC’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night With Seth Meyers to start up again. (HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher and Last Week Tonight With John Oliver resumed over the weekend.)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Says He's \"Furious\" at Studios for Prolonging the Writers Strike\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRobin Williams' Daughter Zelda Criticizes Use of AI to Re-create His Voice: \"I Find It Personally Disturbing\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAll four hosts opened their shows with expressions of gratitude for the WGA’s new contract. In a pre-taped cold open, Colbert pretended to be on a rowboat at sea when a dolphin informed him the strike had ended with, among other things, regulations on artificial intelligence in the writing process: “Oh, I see, artificial intelligence can be used, but it can’t be credited as a writer or be a source of literary material? That makes sense — why did that take five months?”\nAfter 148 days on the open sea, our captain returns to shore just in time to host The Late Show. 🐬#Colbert pic.twitter.com/xI2XKDAq1D\n\n\t“It feels good to be back,” Colbert said, noting that “Thanks to the picket lines, my writers got fresh air and sunshine — and they do not care for that. Now they’re back safely in their joke holes, doing what they do best: Making my prompter word screen full of good and ha-ha.”\n\n\tFallon launched into a series of jokes about how excited he was to be back in the Tonight Show studio: “I’m more excited than a guy seeing the Beetlejuice musical with Lauren Boebert. I’m more excited than a Jets fan during the first three plays of the season.” After a break, he got a little more serious, saying “I had a lot of time — five months — to really sit and think. I just took a moment and realized how grateful I am for all of this, for this show. I really love this job.”\n\n\tKimmel — whose show began a little later than Fallon’s or Colbert’s, thanks to Monday Night Football on ABC — did a cold open of him in therapy (his shrink: guest Arnold Schwarzenegger), before taking the stage only to find it commandeered by a pickleball foursome. (Fallon joked the Tonight studio had been idle for so long, “NBC turned it into a Spirit Halloween.”)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“We’ve been gone so long, The Bachelor is now a grandfather,” he said. “The weirdest thing about being off the air is, when I walk in a room, nobody claps.” He also thanked the show’s crew “and all union crews” and noted that the WGA’s new contract “is a big win for the little guy, and a big win for the chubby guy, and the hairy dude, and the weird girl who doesn’t make eye contact, and the two potheads in the Star Wars T-shirts that are too small for their bodies, the guy who’s too old to have a ponytail and the lady whose cats each have their own Instagram pages. We call them writers, and they are all back to work.”\n\n\tMeyers, in a clip released before the show aired, delivered heartfelt thanks to his fellow writers and WGA leadership for getting the deal done and to the Late Night crew “for their patience while we worked through this very necessary labor stoppage.” \n\n\tHe also acknowledged his family, noting that “It was not easy to have me around for 5 months. I’ll never forget the day this summer, my 7-year-old came up to me and said, ‘Not only do I not care what Rudy Giuliani did today, I’m not gonna care what he does tomorrow.’ While I hear that, I do think he’s missing out.”\n\n\tAfter getting their thankful remarks out of the way, the hosts attempted in varying degrees to recap the time they’d been off the air. Colbert launched into several minutes of clips and jokes about the news of the summer, heavy on the multiple indictments of Donald Trump, and Kimmel went hard at the former president as well. Fallon opted for a simpler strategy: “We have so much news to cover, but I’m going to sum it up in two words: Taylor Swift.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMeyers devoted his entire show to his Closer Look segment (“to the max!”), opening it with a breathless summary of what was to come: \nA post shared by Late Night with Seth Meyers (@latenightseth)\n\n\tFallon had Matthew McConaughey and John Mayer as his first-night guests, while Kimmel welcomed Scwharzenegger and musical guest Jason Isbell. The Late Show featured astrophysicist and Neil deGrasse Tyson and a performance by bandleader Louis Cato. While actors union SAG-AFTRA remains on strike, talk shows are covered under a different contract that allows the hosts to do their jobs and union members to appear, provided they don’t promote any work for struck companies. McConaughey, for example, discussed a children’s book, Just Because, he recently released, as well as his 2021 memoir Greenlights. \nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nInside the business of TV with breaking news, expert analysis and showrunner interviews\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

A new, as yet unnamed entity will be established to manage the talent agency’s current roster of performers. The company said it will ask its fan club members to come up with the name for the new agency.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean Wave Comes Full Circle at the Busan Film Fest\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Chicken Run 2' Director on Reuniting the Flock After 23 Years and Why Mel Gibson Didn't Return\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe move comes after years of cover-ups and denials by Johnny & Associates and amid mounting pressure within Japan and globally for a reckoning.\n\n\tAn external investigative committee set up by the agency says it had received reports of abuse from 478 of Kitagawa’s victims as of Sept. 30, with 325 of them seeking compensation. Some of the victims who have spoken out publicly have alleged that the abuse occurred over one hundred times and began when they were elementary school-aged. \n\n\t“We would like to properly create a framework that stands alongside the victims,” Noriyuki Higashiyama, the current president of Johnny & Associates (locally known as just Johnny’s), said at the Tokyo press conference. \n\n\tBut some members of an advocacy group made up of victims — calling itself the “Johnny’s Sexual Assault Victims Association” (JSAVA) — were sharply critical of the plans unveiled Monday. \n\n\tShinichi Kimura, a former dancer and singer who has alleged he was assaulted at the age of 18 by Kitagawa in the mid-1990s, said it was inappropriate for Johnny’s to simply create a new entity to house its business.\n\n\t“Talent should be transferred to a totally different agency and Johnny’s entertainment activities should be discontinued altogether,” Kimura told the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper. \n\n\tOthers have slammed the company’s rebranding effort. \n\n\t“Naming the company for compensation Smile Up is like asking people to wear white to a funeral. It’s ridiculing the victims,” said a JSAVA member and alleged victim who chose to remain anonymous by using the pseudonym “Izumi.” \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJohnny’s first acknowledged and apologized for the enormous abuses committed by Kitagawa at a press conference on Sept. 7. Julie Keiko Fujishima, Kitagawa’s niece and Johnny’s former president, tearfully resigned and was replaced by Higashiyama, who has been employed by the agency since 1979. The company insisted at the time that it would remain a going concern in the Japanese entertainment world and wouldn’t be changing its name, sparking instant backlash. \n\n\tThe incoming president Higashiyama has also faced allegations that he, too, sexually abused young boys during his long tenure at Johnny’s. When asked about the claims in September, he said, “I don’t remember clearly. Maybe it happened, maybe it didn’t. I have trouble remembering.” \n\n\tPublic pressure on the company escalated significantly in the wake of the September press briefing. Major Japanese advertisers like Asahi Group Holdings and Nissan said they would no longer use Johnny’s performers in their TV commercials, while national broadcaster NHK promised to not employ the agency’s performers until the company had implemented compensation to past victims. \n\n\tAt the press conference on Monday, Higashiyama more directly denied the sexual abuse allegations against him, but added that he may have committed acts of power harassment in his youth. He also acknowledged that the company’s response at the September press conference had been inadequate. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHe said: “That was indeed criticized as being inward-looking. We have since considered what a fresh start would entail.”\n\n\tHigashiyama said the company will begin providing compensation to victims in November. Once all victims have been compensated, Smile Up will be disbanded, he said. \n\n\tWhen Kitagawa died of a stroke in 2019, he was a national institution in Japan, credited with pioneering the J-pop boy band model of entertainment that swept Asia in the 1980s and 1990s, ahead of the K-pop wave that would later conquer the world. A ruthless businessman, he was known for his masterful manipulation of Tokyo’s top media and entertainment conglomerates, leveraging his talent’s star power to command top fees and total obedience over how he and his company were covered. Upon Kitagawa’s death, then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe offered condolences.\n\n\tFor decades, however, talk of Kitagawa using his agency to sexually prey upon the young boys and men in his employ was considered an open secret across the Japanese entertainment world. The earliest known legal claims against Kitagawa date back to 1965, when the parents of four boys attempted to sue him for making sexual advances toward their children. A number of books written by former Johnny’s stars were later published in the late 1980s and 1990s containing accounts of abuse both experienced and witnessed. Then, in 1999, a local tabloid published a 10-part series detailing graphic accounts of rape by Kitagawa from a dozen victims. Kitagawa proceeded to sue the publisher for libel and won damages, but the decision was later overturned, with the Tokyo High Court concluding that the abuse allegations were “largely true.” Nonetheless, Japan’s mainstream media maintained near-total silence — even though the allegations involved the man behind some of the country’s very biggest pop stars, including idol groups like SMAP, Shonentai, Arashi and Travis Japan. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIt wasn’t until the BBC aired an in-depth documentary examining the allegations this March — Predator: The Secret Scandal of J-pop — that victims began to speak out publicly and Japanese media started to cautiously cover the scandal. \n\n\tSeveral weeks after the airing of the BBC’s documentary, Kauan Okamoto, a former member of Johnny’s trainee program for aspiring pop idols, Johnny’s Jr., joined the early public accusers by giving a press conference at the Foreign Correspondent’s Club of Japan detailing further allegations against the deceased media magnate.\n\nOkamoto said he signed with the agency when he was 15 years old in 2012, and that he was subsequently abused by Kitagawa about 15 to 20 times over the next four years. He also said he saw Kitagawa sexually assault three of his fellow teenage trainees.According to local press reports, when asked why the boys put up with the abuse, Okamoto said, “In the first place, the boys who could make their debuts at Johnny’s were Mr. Johnny’s favorites. Everybody understood that a word from Mr. Johnny dictates everything.” He also said that he had heard from other Johnny’s Jr. boys, “If you don’t go to [Kitagawa’s] mansion, you won’t become a star.”\n\n\tIn August, a working group from the U.N. Human Rights Council investigated the situation and issued a report concluding that Kitagawa had abused hundreds of boys and that the agency he founded had not taken responsibility for the crimes. Dozens of other victims have since joined Okamoto in coming forward publicly (Johnny’s Sexual Assault Victims Association has published a partial list of accusers, including the time period and age at which the abuse occurred). \n\n\tAround that same time, a former veteran Johnny’s staffer told local tabloid Shukan Bunshun — the same outlet that Kitagawa sued in the 1990s — that the situation was “more than a case of the president of an idol empire being a sexual predator.” \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“This was a sexual abuser who created an idol empire just so that he could groom boys on their way to making their [showbiz] debut,” he said.   \nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

But it’s very surprising how few of television’s biggest platforms have even attempted to reproduce that success. There has probably been a visible uptick in available Korean programming in the States but — perhaps in tacit recognition of the fact that Squid Game became Squid Game because of its stealthy word-of-mouth explosion — there hasn’t been an evident rise in shows getting a big promotional push in the hopes of becoming the NEXT Squid Game.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'iCarly' Sequel Canceled at Paramount+\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParamount+ Names Anna Priest U.K. Head, Pluto TV Gets Senior VP, Int'l Content Programming, Acquisitions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIf nothing else, Paramount+ is giving a push to the new six-part drama Bargain, from writer-director Jeon Woo-sung. It’s frequently easy to see why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBargain\t\t\n\t\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\t\n\tA taut one-shot wonder.\n\t\n\n\n\nAirdate: Thursday, October 5Cast: Jin Sun-Kyu, Jun Jong-Seo, Chang RyulCreator/Director: Jeon Woo-Sung\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirdate: Thursday, October 5Cast: Jin Sun-Kyu, Jun Jong-Seo, Chang RyulCreator/Director: Jeon Woo-Sung\n\nBargain is not, of course, the next Squid Game. Nothing is. Or when something is, it will probably emerge out of nowhere.\n\n\tBut it isn’t a wholly inappropriate comparison, especially in thematic terms: Like Squid Game, Bargain uses an elaborate genre exercise for a class critique in which the elite are literally and figuratively preying on the economically disadvantaged. Bargain might be a hair less cynical than Squid Game, but in its often metaphorical evisceration of a commodity culture that itemizes and monetizes the poor, right down to biological minutiae, it’s pretty damn cynical.\n\n\tAnd, as was the case with Squid Game, it will be easy for anybody who wants to ignore the series’ message — see Netflix’s soulless decision to make a “reality” version of Squid Game — to concentrate on the formal elements in Bargain, because Jeon Woo-sung’s direction is attention-grabbing, format-challenging and, at its best, pretty remarkable.\n\n\tIt happens that in between the provocative themes and showy direction, Bargain has a story and characters that are stretched absurdly thin. But with the breathless episodes clocking in at between 35 and 37 minutes, you can avoid focusing on those flaws as much as you choose to.\n\nBargain begins with Park Joo-Young (Jeon Jong-Seo) staring listlessly out the window of a comfortable but remote hotel. All she can see in the distance are mountains and a reservoir. She’s awaiting Noh Hyung-soo (Jin Sun-kyu), who has reached an agreement to take Joo-Young’s virginity for the agreed-upon price of $1,000 (per the sometimes spotty subtitles). Hyung-soo likes what he sees and expresses pleasure that in a world in which nothing is as advertised, Joo Young looks like her picture. But he doubts her virginity and demands to see blood. Ew.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThen he tries bargaining down her price, one of several ways in which the title of the show is literal. Hyung-soo is gross. The whole situation is gross. But don’t worry. It gets worse!\n\n\tSee, despite her schoolgirl uniform and exaggerated giggle, Joo-Young is not, in fact, an 18-year-old high-school junior. She’s an operator in an organ trafficking ring, and Hyung-soo — also not who he claims to be — is soon strapped to a gurney and subjected to an auction, selling off his bits and pieces to the highest bidders. Hyung-soo’s first kidney has just gone for well over $100,000 to Geuk-ryul (Chang Ryul), a dutiful son whose father keeps getting usurped on the transplant list by wealthier patients, when the hotel is rocked by an earthquake and then a landslide.\n\n\tHyung-soo, Joo-Young and occasionally Geuk-ryul (who everybody mostly calls “The Good Son”) spend the next 2.5 hours trying to escape from the collapsed ruins of the hotel, where they’re going to discover that people whose morality allows them to buy and sell the organs of unwitting victims are also willing to do anything to survive. Throw in the prospect of stealing millions from the crumbling enterprise’s coffers and the stakes and body count only rise.\n\n\tIt’s here that I should mention the conceit, or possibly gimmick, behind Woo-Sung’s adaptation of what was apparently a 2015 South Korean short film: Each episode of Bargain is designed to look like a single, continuous shot and, if you were to remove the title sequences and episodic title cards, one could process the show as a continuous three-hour shot — up until some cheating in the lackluster final minutes, designed to set up a second season.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNow at this point, smart viewers have been trained to recognize masked cuts. Bargain is full of them, some very, very obvious — when the camera follows characters plunging from a high floor of the hotel through a perfectly symmetrical hole that goes from rooftop to cellar, it is not, in fact, an uninterrupted practical shot — and some capitalizing on a chaotic environment in which flickering lights, pockets of darkness and plumes of debris offer distractions and technical feints.\n\n\tOccasionally there’s a “How the heck did he do that?” quality to Woo-sung’s direction and the cinematography by Young-Ho Kim. I was more frequently just enjoying the cohesive claustrophobic effect that comes from the technique, as the characters start on the hotel’s fifth floor, make their way to the basement where a pair of laborers dispose of the hollowed-out bodies, and then move back up through the hotel in search of escape.\n\n\tThe hotel is, as I already said, a metaphor, as is generally the case in the building-escape subgenre. From The Towering Inferno to The Raid to Dredd, stories like this use their settings as embodiments of a hierarchy in which the rich are perched precariously at the top, doing anything in their ample power to ignore and then repress the strivers at the bottom.\n\n\tIt’s also an easily segmented environment that lends itself to episodic storytelling. The installment in the cellar — home to a fish-filled pool, gnarly corpse-dismemberment tools and dingy, chipped tiling on the walls and floors — is like something out of a Saw movie, with the director staging torture and an escape attempt in the most dazzling of the show’s one-shot feats. One later episode includes action in a very cramped hotel room; another becomes something out of Reservoir Dogs, with lots of high-intensity shouting and, well, bargaining as characters try to figure out who they can trust and what they’ll have to do in order to survive. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe series’ production design is, by necessity, a malleable marvel, full of twisty hallways and strategically placed crevasses and chasms for characters to navigate or spot approaching terrors through. Just because few of the endless shots are actually longer than five or 10 minutes without a cut doesn’t mean that there isn’t a ton of very intricate choreography at play.\n\n\tI mentioned characters a couple of times there, and I probably should have put “characters” in quotation marks. Bargain is mostly Hyung-Soo and Joo-Young bickering and ascending, with occasional appearances by the Good Son, who shows up exclusively to demand that Hyung-Soo live up to his responsibilities, organ-wise, however involuntary that donation was. He’s there for a strange sort of earnest comedy as well as part of a running joke in which all of these people, victims of circumstance, demand that other people take responsibility for things — medical equity, infrastructure improvements, decency — that ideally should be the mandate of state and religious institutions. Chang provides one sort of dark laughs and Jin provides both high drama and a broader sort of comedy, since his character is stuck dealing with the apocalypse in red boxer-briefs and shiny galoshes for much of the series. It’s left to Jun to play the most fully realized character in a show in which hardly anybody else even has a name, making Joo-Young both victim and capable perpetrator depending on the moment.\n\n\tDon’t spend much time trying to ponder the realism of the interactions between any of the main characters. Don’t spend much time contemplating the practical geography of the hotel. And definitely don’t spend much time trying to make sense of the business plan governing this prostitution/trafficking ring. This is not a show that thrives on common sense or nuance, which caused some diminishing of my interest as the series charged toward a conclusion that felt perfunctory more than cumulative.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tStill, as an intense piece of directorial ingenuity and a pitch-black satire of the dehumanized state of contemporary culture, Bargain is fully worthy of what ought to be initial curiosity and then burgeoning buzz.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for Now See This for recommendations on what to watch and why from THR’s chief TV critic\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
{"title": "SAG-AFTRA Leader: Actors Should Get Same AI Protections As Studios", "date": "2023-10-04 23:54:16", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nAt a hearing before the Federal Trade Commission the same day the union was negotiating with the AMPTP, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland emphasized a \"double standard\" in the potential use of AI by companies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tWinston Cho\n\n\n\tConsent, credit and compensation.\n\n\tThose were the terms that SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and Writers Guild of America West negotiating committee member John August called for in order for guild members’ work, likenesses and brands to be used to train artificial intelligence systems. At a hearing before the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday, they joined other representatives for various groups — including authors, voice actors and musicians — to warn of the encroachment of generative AI into the media and entertainment industries that they say undercuts their labor and presents heightened risks of fraud.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSAG-AFTRA Negotiations to Continue Friday, Next Week\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLondon Film Festival Opens With 'Saltburn' Premiere as U.K. Crew Stages Protest Outside\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe rise of AI tools have concerned creators who’ve been urging policymakers to institute guardrails surrounding the use of the technology. In the absence of regulation, the WGA secured a deal with studios and streamers that provides some protection for members on how it can be credited and utilized. SAG-AFTRA has been pushing for similar terms in its negotiations.\n\n\tCrabtree-Ireland, who left the hearing early to return to negotiations with studios, said that human-generated content from actors, like in their likenesses, voices and performances, “reflects real and substantial work in its intellectual property” deserving of legal protection. He stressed a “double standard” in the potential use of AI by studios and other companies looking to deploy the technology.\n\n\t“If an individual decided to infringe on one of these companies’ copyright-protected content, and distributed it without paying for the licensing rights,” Crabtree-Ireland said, “that individual would face a great deal of financial and legal ramifications.”\n\n\tHe added, “So why is the reverse not true? Shouldn’t the individuals whose intellectual property was used to train the AI algorithm at least be equally protected?”\n\n\tCopyright doesn’t account for actors faces or singers voices, but there are laws in some states — like California, New York and Florida — that protect against unauthorized commercial use of a person’s name, likeness and persona, among other things. It’s meant to provide people the exclusive right to profit off of their identities. Music publishers are currently pushing for a federal right of publicity law to combat voice mimicry in AI tracks that would likely also help actors and other creators.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAs part of their tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, writers ensured that the use of generative AI tools won’t affect their credit or compensation and must be disclosed by studios. August, pointing to those provisions of the agreement, likened scribes and other artists to small business, “each competing in the marketplace to sell their work.” To succeed, writers develop unique styles and brands that are essentially being stolen by AI companies indiscriminately scraping the Internet for material to train AI systems, he explained.\n\n\t“This is theft, not fair use,” August said, referring to the legal concept that copyrighted works can be used to make new creations as long as they are transformative. “Our work, protected by copyright and our own contractual rights, are being used entirely without our authorization, without any attribution, or compensation.”\n\n\tFor writers and authors, the issue isn’t just about the copying of their scripts or books that are then fed into so-called large language models that power the human-mimicking AI bots that can produce pitches and loglines in a matter of seconds. It’s also about AI companies profiting off of their work by creating infringing material, which the FTC has signaled could rise to an unfair method of competition. August said that bad actors are “using stolen goods to undercut the prices of a seller,” like in AI-generated knockoffs of popular novels that are being sold on Amazon.\n\n\tThis remains a point of contention for writers, he continued, because the WGA deal only covers their work for studios, while “most of the real work on AI is being done by companies like Google, Facebook and OpenAI,” which have no contractual relationship with the guild. August emphasized, “Public policy will play a crucial role in protecting our members.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAt the hearing, much of concerns raised by the WGA were echoed by Authors Guild policy director Umair Kazi. He focused most of his remarks on the use of members’ works as training data for AI companies, which are fueling the production of competing derivative works.\n\n\t“It is inherently unfair to use copyrighted works to create highly profitable tech, which is also able to produce competing derivative works without the creators consent, compensation or credit,” Kazi said. “There’s a serious risk of market dilution from machine generated books and other works that can be cheaply mass produced, and shall inevitably lower the economic and artistic value of human created works.”\n\n\tFor example, generative AI is already being used to impersonate popular authors to create low-quality ebooks. Kazi detailed, “Earlier this year, AI-generated books started dominating Amazon’s best-seller list in the young adult romance category.”\n\n\tLast month, the Authors Guild — led by prominent authors including George R.R. Martin, Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham — stepped into the legal battle against OpenAI. The group, with more than 13,000 members in its ranks, represents what is likely the most formidable opponent suing the company in a case that could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and an order requiring it to destroy systems trained on copyrighted works.\n\n\tA potential licensing market is a critical component of whether AI companies will be able to avail themselves of a fair-use defense in lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement. AI companies will likely run into the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts v. Goldsmith, which effectively reined in the scope of fair use. In that case, the majority stressed that an analysis of whether an allegedly infringing work was sufficiently transformed must be balanced against the “commercial nature of the use.” If authors are able to establish that OpenAI’s scraping of their novels undercut their economic prospects to profit off of their works by, for example, interfering with potential licensing deals that the company could have instead pursued, then fair use is likely not to be found, according to legal experts consulted by THR.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAn opt-in system should be mandatory under any potential licensing regime, said August. This means that creators wouldn’t be forced to opt out for their work to be excluded from training data.\n\n\tMultiple speakers also alerted the FTC on the rise of fraud using AI tools. Tim Friedlander, president of the National Association of Voice Actors, pointed to deepfake ads featuring Tom Hanks and MrBeast. “Currently it only takes three seconds of source audio to create a realistic voice clone, and synthetic content can be used to deceive consumers into believing that trusted voices are communicating with them,” he said.\n\n\tJust this week, Hanks and MrBeast took to social media to warn fans that businesses pilfered their likenesses without consent to create AI versions of themselves for commercial purposes.\n\n\tIn one of the more disturbing allegations, Sara Ziff, founder of the Model Alliance, said that modeling agencies are using AI deepfakes rather than hiring real models to meet diversity goals.\n\n\t“A digital model who was created through AI in 2017 by the world’s first all digital modeling agency has appeared as a base of high-end brands, such as BMW and Louis Vuitton,” said Ziff, who noted that Levi also announced this year that it’s using AI-generated models to increase the appearance of diversity. “Critics have called this a form of digital blackface.”\n\n\tThe scope of potentially fraudulent business practices the FTC is concerned about also includes actions that some companies may be deploying to undermine labor. Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya pointed to studios cornering background actors into scanning their likenesses for future use.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nUnique expertise on how the law impacts Hollywood pros, projects and processes\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

I’m honored to have worked so closely with you,” said Creed series star and Creed III director Michael B. Jordan via video (the MGM threequel was the last film Lomis released in theaters before his death).\n\n\tThe long list of filmmakers, stars and studio executives paying tribute to Lomis throughout the evening also included director Paul Thomas Anderson — the duo worked closely together on the release of indie hit Licorice Pizza — and Chris Aronson, host of the evening and longtime Lomis colleague who now runs domestic distribution at Paramount. The event was sponsored by Amazon MGM Studios, where Lomis was working at the time of his death.\n\n\t“I was smitten with him, and our love affair began immediately. I could listen to his voice for hours,” Anderson said on stage when recalling first working together on The Master at The Weinstein Co. (Lomis never hesitated in standing up to Harvey Weinstein, a point alluded to repeatedly at Wednesday night’s dinner by those who know him best.)\n\n\tAnderson continued in describing Lomis: “I never met anyone who looked like a fucking booker or lineman whose language could make Richard Pryor blush,” says Anderson. “But it didn’t take me very long to realize he was just a big softie.”\n\n\t“He was an inspirational leader who had an impact wherever he went,” Aronson later told the crowd before announcing that Wednesday’s event raised $1,200,007.\n\n\tChristina Blumer, executive director of the Will Rogers Foundation, spearheaded the committee that decided to use this year’s event as a way of paying tribute to Lomis. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Pioneer Award, an annual tradition for more than seven decades, is one of the most prestigious tributes in the entertainment industry and within the philanthropic community. The proceeds from the charity dinner benefits the Pioneers Assistance Fund, which provides financial assistance to individuals in the motion picture distribution and exhibition community who are encountering an illness, injury or life-changing event.\n\n\tLomis was closely involved with the charity and was the host of last year’s show when Broccoli and Wilson received the Pioneer Award.\n\n\tPast Pioneer honorees include Tom Cruise, Donna Langley, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, Elizabeth Banks, Jim Gianopulos, Dick Cook, Michael D. Eisner, Alan Horn, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Sherry Lansing, Jack Warner, Darryl F. Zanuck and Cecil B.

{"title": "Selena Gomez Hosts Inaugural Rare Impact Fund Benefit, Calling Mental Health Fund “The Most Important Thing That I’ve Ever Done”", "date": "2023-10-05 06:06:39", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nMartin Short served as emcee for the benefit, where items including Taylor Swift tickets and a movie night with Paul Rudd were auctioned off to support mental health services.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tKirsten Chuba\n\nEvents Editor\n\nSelena Gomez continued her commitment to mental health awareness Wednesday, hosting the inaugural Rare Impact Fund Benefit: A Night of Radiance & Reflection in Los Angeles. The event supported the Rare Impact Fund’s mission to reduce the stigma associated with mental health and expand access to mental health services and education for young people around the world.\n\n\t“I’ve always wanted to do one but I thought we were too young to maybe do it,” Gomez, who launched the fund in 2020, told The Hollywood Reporter of throwing the benefit. “We’re in a good place and I guess why not now? We’re stoked to be able to do this, it’s going to a great cause and I just couldn’t be luckier.” \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNFL Defends Social Media Focus on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Amid Backlash\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTravis Kelce Says Coverage of Taylor Swift at His Games Is \"Overdoing It\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tGomez’s Only Murders in the Building co-star Martin Short served as emcee for the evening, which also featured a special performance from H.E.R. and a DJ set by Marshmello. \n\n\tInside the event, Gomez took the stage and admitted the event was very overwhelming for her (“to be honest, I threw up this morning”), as she told the crowd, “This has been the culmination of a lifelong dream for me, but it has also stemmed from some of the darkest moments in my life.”\n\n\t“I struggled with the world inside my head for a long time and I felt lost and I felt hopeless at times. In 2020 I received my diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and to be honest, everything quickly changed. I actually got the knowledge and the answers I had been desperate for for so long, and understanding that obviously makes me become more aware of it, and I’m less afraid than I used to be,” she continued. “With that knowledge I could seek out the support I needed, to be myself, to find my joy again, and tonight I’m very proud to say that I have.  I’m working really hard every day and I’m so happy just to be alive and be here with you guys today.”\n\n\tGomez noted that if she, a person with resources, struggled for so long, what does that mean for those who don’t have access to the same support. The Rare Impact Fund has a goal of raising $100 million over the course of 10 years to provide those resources, which the star said “probably sounds really absurd, but I think it’s possible and I think I can do it. When I look at my little sister Gracie, the world that she and her generation inherits must be a better one — a kinder one, a clearer one, a more connected one, with support and access.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“It has been my ultimate dream to launch this fund and it’s probably the most important thing that I’ve ever done, and I just couldn’t be more proud of the Rare Impact team for the work that they’re doing,” Gomez said, finishing off her speech by thanking the crowd for “everything you’re going to do tonight; it’s the hardest journey I’ve ever been on but by far the most rewarding.”  \n\n\tFor his portion, Short unleashed a nonstop monologue of jokes, frequently teasing both Gomez and their missing third OMITB co-star Steve Martin. \n\n\t“I am proud to call Selena Gomez my friend, and not because she’s successful or rich; because she’s both,” Short teased at one point, before remarking seriously, “What makes tonight very important is we’re here to support youth mental health awareness. I don’t think there’s anyone in this room that hasn’t been touched by mental health and its issues and the pain it can bring a family. We are here to raise urgent funds for the young people who need them.”\n\n\tShort also led the evening’s auction, which included items like a glam session with Gomez’s stylists, a movie night with Paul Rudd, lunch with Camila Cabello and the biggest ticket item of the event, Taylor Swift concert tickets (which eventually sold for $15,000). \n\n\tGuests at the event also included Taylor Lautner, Tyga, Sofia Carson and longtime friend Francia Raisa, who spoke about the impact she’s seen Gomez have after being open with her own struggles.\n\n\t“She’s a brown woman and there’s such a stigma within Latinx households about mental health and seeking help, and she has such a big platform and such a big voice, so if this could help a little girl talk to her parent about mental health and they can hear that Selena Gomez is advocating for it, then it’s worth it,” Raisa said. “I want to be here and be a part of that as a first-generation American who also advocates for mental health.”  \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

The second match will run on Tuesday Jan. 16, the night after ESPN’s Monday Night Football NFL Wild Card game, giving both matches a football-driven promotional boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVince Vaughn Recalls 'Rudy' and 'Wedding Crashers' Roles During Spirited ESPN Appearance\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch WNBA Playoff Games Online Without Cable\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThere will be 15 regular season matches, plus semifinals and finals matches.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAll the matches will run on ESPN or ESPN2, and will also be simulcast on ESPN+. ABC will also air a TGL preview show on Saturday, Dec. 30. TMRW Sports and ESPN say that it is a “multi-year partnership.”\n\n\t“We think TGL is a well-aligned partner … from the time I was first connected with Mike I was impressed by their vision,” says Rosalyn Durant, executive vp of programming and acquisitions for ESPN, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “This is a fresh take on a familiar sport, you have the names, you have the foundation to draw all those existing fans, but then you have the innovation at the technology, the fan engagement to entice new fans.”\n\n\tMcCarley added that ESPN was “the ideal place and people to do this with.”\n\n\t“It’s going to fit with the rest of their programming and there’s going to be a natural tendency for the fans who are already there to watch this and, and keep coming back each week,” he added, noting that launching it after the NFL regular season was over and the end of college football season was a strategic decision. “You’ve got an opening from a national sports standpoint in kind of those early week windows… [for] most sports fans its too cold to go outside or they’re snowed in and providing them you know, a view and a sport that’s going to look a little bit different but it’s going to be familiar because of the players who are playing.”\n\n\tWoods, McIlroy and McCarley launched TMRW Sports last year, with TGL being their first project. Investors in TMRW Sports include former NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, executives like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin and Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, athletes like NBA star Steph Curry, F1 racer Lewis Hamilton and NFL quarterback Josh Allen, and entertainers like Justin Timberlake and Justin Bieber.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe company has since sold regional TGL teams to the likes of New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, who will own the New York team; Fenway Sports Group, which controls the Boston team; Arthur Blank, who owns the Atlanta team; and Alexis Ohanian and Serena and Venus Williams, who own the Los Angeles team. There will ultimately be six teams in the TGL.\n\n\tThe teams will consist of current PGA Tour players, with Woods, McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Matt Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose, Adam Scott, Xander Schauffele, Max Homa, Rickie Fowler, and Billy Horschel all committed to participate. TGL said at the outset that it intended to work with existing PGA Tour partners as it pursued media deals.\n\n\tWoods, of course, is known for being ratings gold when it comes to live golf coverage.\n\n\t“Look at the partners he’s brought on board from Tiger and Rory, look at the investors that are connected to this business, look at the team owners there. It may be a new business concept, but these aren’t people new to business and new to the profession and to the sport of golf,” Durant said. “So we have we have full confidence in what they’re doing. We have full confidence in how it’s going to be presented. We have confidence in the names and the reach of audience that they’re going to bring on board.”\n\n\t“We’re confident that we’ll be able to bring their expertise in the game and the sport with our megaphone that is the ESPN brand, using our reach and the fandom that comes with ESPN to help bring in and expand their audience,” she adds.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe matches will take place at a newly-constructed high-tech venue, the SoFi Center in Palm Beach, Florida. Players will all be wearing microphones, with live fans in the arena to watch and cheer them on in the two-hour matches.\n\n\t“From a sports fan’s standpoint, this is like sitting courtside at an NBA game,” McCarley says. “And for the fan at home, it’s also that NBA courtside experience, it’s lights, it’s music, it’s player introductions. All the players will be miked up so that conversation, that kind of running conversation throughout the competition will be an important piece of it.”\n\n\tESPN already televises a number of golf events, televising the first two rounds of The Masters as well as the PGA Championship, and PGA Tour Live content on ESPN+.\n\n\tCAA’s merchant bank Evolution Media Capital (EMC) advised TMRW Sports on TGL’s domestic agreement with ESPN, and is also advising TGL on its international media rights distribution.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

He was 80.\n\n\tA member of the Screen Actors Guild for more than four decades, Butkus died peacefully in his sleep overnight at his home in Malibu, his family announced Thursday.\n\n\n\n\tFrom 1987-89, Butkus had a recurring role as cafe owner Ed Klawicki on My Two Dads, an NBC sitcom about two single men (Paul Reiser, Greg Evigan) raising a teenage daughter (Staci Keanan).\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPaul Noble, Top Marketing Executive at Sony Pictures Entertainment, Dies at 51\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNFL Defends Social Media Focus on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Amid Backlash\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tButkus joined the NBC Saturday morning series Hang Time in 1998 as old-school Deering High Tornados basketball coach Mike Katowinski, taking over for former NBA star Reggie Theus, and he worked on that show for its final three seasons.\n\n\tEarlier, Butkus was a regular on two short-lived, light-hearted network dramas: ABC’s Blue Thunder, which featured Dana Carvey and a gadget-filled helicopter, and NBC’s Half Nelson, a Joe Pesci starrer created by Glen A. Larson about a Beverly Hills security outfit. \n\n\tAnd in the teen sex comedy Hamburger: The Motion Picture (1986), Butkus starred as Drootin, a drill sergeant-like teacher at Buster Burger University, a school for prospective fast-food franchise owners.\n\n\tButkus played nine NFL seasons, from 1965-73, all with the Bears, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility. At 6-foot-3 and 245 pounds, he was known for his incredible drive, strength, leadership, speed, agility and ability to demoralize opponents.\n\n\t“He’s the meanest, angriest, toughest, dirtiest son of a bitch in football. An animal, a savage, subhuman,” is what Playboy magazine made of him in an October 1971 profile.\n\n\tLate NFL Films co-founder Steve Sabol once called Butkus his favorite NFL player, saying, “To me, his career was the most sustained work of devastation ever committed, anywhere, anytime. … Remember how he used to tackle? If anything were hanging out — whether it was your chinstrap, elbow pad, shoulder pad, shoe — it would be ripped off. He mauled and tore ball carriers apart.”\n\n\tChicago through and through, Butkus was born in the city and went to Chicago Vocational High School before starring at the University of Illinois. The Bears retired his No. 51 in 1994.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/BxVt7EfV9Q\n\n\tAfter hanging up his helmet, Butkus displayed a flair for comedy in his Miller Lite commercials, often appearing along another former NFL scruncher, Bubba Smith, where they tried to pass themselves off as refined gentlemen who play polo and tennis and attend the opera.\n\n\tWhen it came to acting, “I was worried about making a mistake, because people would say, ‘He’s just a football player,’ so I was harder on myself to do it right,” he told the Chicago Tribune in 1998. “Then I learned from the Miller Lite commercials. ‘Who cares if you blow a line?’ It doesn’t matter if you do it in one take or 100 takes, if I can do it better each time.\n\n\t“The end result is what people see. Working with Bubba, I was able to add things with facial gestures and stuff. … I could play off him and add something. It didn’t matter if I got the laugh.”\n\n\tThe youngest of nine children in a Lithuanian-American family, Richard Marvin Butkus was born on Dec. 9, 1942. His father was an electrician, and his mother worked in a laundry. Raised on the South Side of town, he rooted for the old Chicago Cardinals and added muscle by moving furniture with his four older brothers.\n\n\tButkus played fullback and linebacker in high school, making 70 percent of his team’s tackles, then led the Fighting Illini to a Rose Bowl victory over Washington in 1964 as a junior.\n\n\tIn an Oct. 12, 1964, cover story for Sports Illustrated, Dan Jenkins kicked off his piece about him: “If every college football team had a linebacker like Dick Butkus of Illinois, all fullbacks soon would be three feet tall and sing soprano. Dick Butkus is a special kind of brute whose particular talent is mashing runners into curious shapes.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Bears selected him with the No. 3 pick in the 1965 NFL Draft, then signed him for less money than the Denver Broncos of the rival American Football League were offering — Butkus wanted to play in Chicago.\n\n\tAs a rookie, he was named to the All-NFL first team (the first of six times) and made the Pro Bowl for the first of eight straight seasons. He finished his career with an NFL record 27 opponents’ fumble recoveries, many coming as the result of his jarring hits, and ESPN named him the 70th greatest athlete of the 20th century.\n\n\t“When I went out on the field to warm up, I would manufacture things to make me mad,” he once said. “If someone on the other team was laughing, I’d pretend he was laughing at me or the Bears. It always worked for me.”\n\n\tWhile he was still playing, Butkus appeared in a commercial for Prestone antifreeze on the first-ever Monday Night Football telecast in 1970 and showed up in Brian’s Song, the acclaimed 1971 ABC telefilm about his doomed teammate, running back Brian Piccolo.\n\n\tButkus said he fought the “dumb jock” stereotype in Hollywood with the help of actor friends like Larry Hagman and Tom Poston.\n\n\tIn addition to the Miller Lite spots, Blue Thunder and Half Nelson, he and Smith also were paired on episodes of Coach and MacGyver; in a 1978 TV movie, Superdome; and in the 1990 sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch.\n\n\tBefitting a real actor, Butkus did a spaghetti Western, Cipolla Colt (1975), and his home in Malibu is on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHe also received high marks for playing Brom Bones in a 1980 telefilm adaptation of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and appeared in other movies like Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976), Gus (1976), Johnny Dangerously (1984), Necessary Roughness (1991) and Any Given Sunday (1999).\n\n\tHis TV résumé also included episodes of Emergency!, Police Story, The Rockford Files, Growing Pains, Wonder Woman, Magnum, P.I. and Night Court.\n\n\tButkus replaced the fired Jimmy “The Greek” Snyder as a studio analyst for CBS’ The NFL Today in 1988 (he worked two seasons at that), was a WrestleMania referee and called Bears games on the radio.\n\n\tHe married his high school sweetheart, Helen Essenberg, in 1963, and they had three children, Ricky, Matt and Nikki.\n\n\tIn one of his last public appearances, he was at the Bears’ season-opener, a Sept. 10 loss to the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field.\n\n\tIn another Sports Illustrated story, this one by Rick Telander in 2004, Butkus spelled out the difference between football and acting for him.\n\n\t“Football for me was never work,” he said. “If you love something, it’s not work. … But if acting were my real true love, I’d be honing my craft, wouldn’t I, over at some shitty theater?”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
{"title": "‘Pet Sematary: Bloodlines’ Filmmaker Lindsey Anderson Beer Talks Her Prequel to Stephen King’s Classic Novel and Tarantino’s ‘Star Trek’", "date": "2023-10-05 23:10:05", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nThe screenwriter-turned-director boasts a lengthy list of IP involvement, including 'Trek' — which afforded her a front row seat to Tarantino expounding for 20 minutes straight about what his R-rated movie could be.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tBrian Davids\n\nWriter\n\n\tGuillermo Del Toro often says that a filmography is actually a biography for the filmmaker involved, but in the case of Lindsey Anderson Beer, her filmography doesn’t come close to telling her story.\n\n\tBeer is currently making her feature directorial debut with Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, a prequel to Stephen King’s classic horror novel Pet Sematary (1983) that explores Jud Crandall’s (Jackson White) backstory and finally defines the Timmy Baterman (Jack Mulhern) story that has only been alluded to in various on-screen adaptations. The Paramount+ film originally began as a prequel to 2019’s Pet Sematary, however, once Beer came on board to write and direct, Bloodlines instead morphed into a prequel to King’s book.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllen Burstyn on Why Her Career Is Busier Than Ever: \"Everybody Else Who Could Play Those Parts Has Already Died\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSia Drops Signature Wig for Beauty Event to Debut Facelift and Honor Plastic Surgeon: \"He Is Incredible\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“I was actually not trying to tailor it to the 2019 film. In my head, it’s a prequel to the book,” Beer tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I was just trying to do my own thing, and the book, to me, is what was sacred. So I just treated that as my North Star.”\n\nBloodlines may be Beer’s first directorial outing, but she’s been a prolific screenwriter for nearly a decade now. She’s worked on a staggering list of franchises as either a screenwriter or a member of a writers’ room in order to develop long-term plans or cinematic universes for some of those properties. Her filmography may not reflect her wide variety of experiences, but that partial list of IP includes: Transformers, Star Trek, Fast and Furious, the Godzilla-led MonsterVerse, The Wizard of the Oz, Pacific Rim, Sleepy Hollow, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, Bambi and Hello Kitty.\n\n\tOne of Beer’s most memorable moments as a working screenwriter took place in Quentin Tarantino’s writers’ room for his now-defunct R-rated Star Trek film. \n\n\t“There was a funny moment where [Tarantino] just stopped in the middle of that room and turned to me and said, ‘Lindsey, you’re really good at this,’” Beer recalls. “And getting that compliment from somebody whose career I admire so much meant a lot, obviously.”\n\n\tBelow, during a conversation with THR that took place prior to the end of the WGA strike, Beer also reflects on how much the Transformers writers’ room impacted her career, before addressing the entertainment industry’s current existential crisis at length.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you have a fun name, and the name of your production company, Lab Brew, implies that you’re well aware of that. Do you think that type of childhood nameplay was the first domino to fall en route to you eventually becoming a writer? Was that the first writing muscle you developed?\n\n\tThat is a really good question that I have honestly thought about, and I wasn’t teased for my last name the way you would think I was. I really wasn’t. The worst of it was guys bringing me to high school parties and being like, “I brought the beer!” That isn’t very traumatic, but it probably did help instill at least an appreciation for comedy and writing.\n\nWhat was the actual path to becoming a screenwriter? It wasn’t a direct line from what I understand.\n\n\tWell, it wasn’t a direct line and not because of an intention. As a child, I always wanted to be a director, and I separately wanted to be a novelist. I had no real interest in being a screenwriter, partly because I didn’t know they existed when I was a kid. But I knew that I loved science fiction and that it would probably be my focus. And so in college, I studied neuroscience and robotics as a backdrop to what I hoped would be a great science fiction career. And then I went on to New York where I thought I would start writing my first novel in addition to taking some filmmaking classes. I ended up in branding and marketing for some large companies to support myself at the time, and then I found myself not actually pursuing the creative arts and getting lost in New York life. And then I had a big life event that made me refocus my efforts. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSo I moved to L.A. I drove across the country with my sister, and I started writing as many scripts as I could. I’m a fast writer, so it was a lot. I then networked as much as I could with any assistant that I could and just got my scripts out there. I was pretty shameless. I got an IMDbPro account, and I just started cold-emailing production companies with loglines and scripts. They say they won’t read things on their websites, but they actually do. And through all of this effort, I got my stuff read and things just swelled from there. So I had always wanted to be a director, but until the last couple of years, there wasn’t that much openness to women directing. I couldn’t get people to let me direct my own stuff.\n\nGender is a huge factor without question, but I’ve heard so many stories of now-prominent filmmakers having to sell their early scripts for a more experienced director to bring to life. The powers that be want experience, but they aren’t willing to dole it out.\n\n\tYeah, there’s certainly a rite of passage that you have to go through. I have been making movies since I was maybe nine or ten years old, and I’m also a little bit of a compulsive photographer. So I felt like I was able to take that love of visual language and translate it into world building, and that became a valuable skill on the writing side. But I for sure needed to pay those dues, earn that trust and goodwill and build up the right relationships to be able to direct.\n\nYour filmography is not an accurate representation of your career because you’ve been involved in the development of so many big movies. I tried to organize all of those properties, and I became overwhelmed rather quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(Laughs.)\n\nSo what got the ball rolling on this type of work? What got you in the rotation? \n\n\tHonestly, it was a surprise to me. I came to L.A. wanting Tarantino’s career. I really thought I was going to be on the indie writer-director path, and it just became one thing after another. There were a few coincidences, and a lot of it had to do with my background in robotics and people needing someone with expertise in areas that I had and that lending itself to larger sci-fi projects like Transformers. The genesis of the bigger franchises was a general meeting, and I had written this kind of [Guillermo] Del Toro, darker story about an undead robot. And the person who read it said, “I really feel like if you turn this more into a [Tim] Burton film, there’s a home for it at Disney.” So I rewrote it to be much lighter family fare, and then we gave it to Disney. They didn’t want to buy it, but it did lead to Disney hiring me for a different family film, which was my first big foray into fantasy adventure.\n\n\tOff of that, I got a job at Warner Bros. doing The Wizard of Oz, and off of that, out of happenstance, I had a general meeting with Akiva Goldsman’s company. His executive called Akiva in at one point, and it came up that I had a background in studying artificial intelligence and robotics. And Akiva just so happened to be putting together the Transformers writers’ room at the time and he said, “Would you ever be interested in writing a Transformers film?” And I said, “Absolutely.” So it just kind of happened that I was put in that room, and it began the trend of doing writers’ rooms for big franchises.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThat Transformers writers’ room wasn’t a “let’s break one Transformers story” kind of a room. They said, “Everybody involved here can pitch their own Transformers movie. We can make 12 movies. This is a cinematic universe.” The only thing that was predetermined was that Steven Spielberg really wanted to do a Bumblebee movie and this Amblin-esque thing. And since I’d been writing family movies, everybody thought that I would take that one. And I weighed that, because, clearly, if Spielberg is behind that one and it’s the only one he has an idea for, then that’s the one that’s going to get made. But I was so hungry to move into something that felt a little bit more in line with what I was going for originally, which was a little bit more intense.\n\n\tAnd so I decided, “No, I don’t want to take that one. I just want to pitch the most epic fucking Transformers movie that I can think of, even knowing that it probably won’t get made. But hopefully the right people will hear it and they’ll see that I can do that.” So that’s what I did. I pitched the biggest, darkest, most epic thing I could think of, and I was so excited by it. Paramount and the producers were, too, so that room ignited a great relationship with the producers that ended up producing this movie, Pet Sematary: Bloodlines. It also ignited a great relationship with Paramount, and word spread that I was good at cracking IP. So I started being put in all these writers’ rooms, but I also started being asked to help people crack IP, including Star Trek, which started as the Tarantino writers’ room. Tarantino wanted to do a Star Trek room, which was the most fun room I’ve ever done.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe got in there and he started with, “So what are your guys’ ideas for a movie?” and I think I went first. So he listened to us patiently and just kind of nodded his head, and then he took out his notebook and started talking for 20 minutes with lines of dialogue and passionate ideas that he’d already written. It wasn’t really a story yet; they were just random thoughts he had on a movie, but it was so passionate and so wonderful. And I laughed to myself and thought, “Well, why didn’t we start with that?” There was a funny moment where he just stopped in the middle of that room and turned to me and said, “Lindsey, you’re really good at this.” And getting that compliment from somebody whose career I admire so much meant a lot, obviously. \n\n\tSo that room was also the beginning of a very strong relationship with Bad Robot, and I’ve been brought in a few times on different iterations of Trek, most recently on Star Trek 4. And so Transformers, Star Trek, Di Bonaventura Pictures, Bad Robot and Paramount are the confluence of how all of this came together in terms of me directing Pet Sematary. I was at the point in my career where I had written a bunch of things, and I just felt that I had reached a point where I couldn’t write without directing anymore. \n\n\tSo I said that to my agents and they said, “Well, let’s set some meetings with producers you have strong relationships with.” And one of those was Mark Vahradian who said, “I have to produce whatever you want to direct.” A couple of weeks later, he called and said, “Would you ever be interested in Pet Sematary?” And I said, “Absolutely. It’s my favorite Stephen King book.” I also happened to be writing Star Trek 4 at the time for Paramount, and so I had a good thing with them, although they probably weren’t super happy that I was looking at another project at the same time.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBut the triangulation of those relationships that led me to Pet Sematary, and I had developed a really good shorthand with Paramount and the same producers from Transformers. We were very aligned in terms of character-driven storytelling, even if it was big IP. So it all just came together and happened really quickly. I was hired in March [2021], and I turned around two drafts a week for several months until we were greenlit in May and prepping in June.\n\nWhat makes some of these big movies so difficult to crack? \n\n\tWhat makes them difficult to crack is that they’re often made by committee, as opposed to an auteur. With something like Barbie or Nolan’s Batmans, if you entrust that IP to somebody with a strong point of view, you’re in much better shape, as opposed to when you try to design these stories by committee and you make the IP the only stars of that. The normal development process of writer after writer after writer assumes that there is an objective best way to tell a story, which is just inherently false. A story is, by nature, subjective, and you just need a strong subjective point of view and to trust in that storyteller and invest in that point of view. So that’s why a writers’ room with a showrunner works, but not just a random feature writers’ room. So I think it gets broken just because there are too many cooks in the kitchen and nobody trusts someone to lead, unless it’s somebody like Christopher Nolan.\n\nAs a fan of King’s book, how would you describe your relationship to Mary Lambert’s Pet Sematary (1989), as well as the rest of King’s work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPet Sematary was the first Stephen King book that I read when I was about nine years old. I saw it on the library shelf, and as a big animal lover, I was tricked by pets. So I stayed up all night and read it, cover to cover, and I loved it. And then I ended up sneaking a copy of the movie from a family friend’s library and made my sister watch it. She hated it, I loved it and I just kept re-watching it. So it definitely ignited a lifelong love of Stephen King, and from there, I read literally everything that he’s written.\n\nPieces of the Timmy Baterman story already existed, but in general, was it daunting to invent lore and backstory within King’s world?\n\n\tNot daunting, no. It was really fun. I love that stuff. I re-read the book maybe 20 times while writing the script and just looked for little phrases and threads. There’s so much mythology in there that’s hinted at but not fully explained. So, as a fan, there’s stuff that I’d always wanted answers to, and I found it really satisfying and fun to pull on those threads and try to weave them together.\n\nYou had the tricky task of teaching a younger Jud Crandall a lifelong lesson about the Pet Sematary, all while knowing that he later defies that lesson with the Creed family. Was it difficult to reconcile those two points?\n\n\tI was actually hoping to reconcile it and answer that question, and there were cuts of this movie that maybe did it more explicitly. The book basically suggests that this evil targeted Jud as an older man because he had encountered Timmy and fought the evil as a younger man. So the more desperate or weak or feeble-minded you are, the more this evil force can get in your head. So Jud had fought this off for most of his life, but as he got a little older and a little more forgetful, it whispered to him and convinced him to tell Louis Creed about the burial ground.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project originally started as a prequel to the 2019 reimagining, but it sounds like you approached this as more of a prequel to the book. Is that correct?\n\n\tI was actually not trying to tailor it to the 2019 film. In my head, it’s a prequel to the book. [2019’s writer] Jeff Buhler was the writer on Bloodlines before I came aboard, so I have no idea where conversations started with him and the producers. Perhaps they talked about it more specifically as a prequel to the 2019 movie, but in my mind, so much of the mythology is kind of rewritten. I was just trying to do my own thing, and the book, to me, is what was sacred. So I just treated that as my North Star.\n\nBased on what you’ve said so far about Tarantino, it now makes further sense why you cast Pam Grier in Bloodlines. Was it quite a thrill to rub elbows with her on set?\n\n\tPam’s roles in exploitation films in the ‘70s and also Tarantino’s Jackie Brown are why I wanted to cast her in this movie, and she was the first-and-only person I went to for the role. As badass as you might think Pam Grier is, you are wrong: she is more badass than that in real life. She constantly had me laughing on set, and has the most amazing stories. She’s less the type to rub elbows and more the type to put you in a headlock. She was actually on the set of the first Pet Sematary, visiting Mary Lambert, so this was a long time coming for her. She loves Stephen King, and if anyone is listening, she’d love a role in the Shining universe.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you decide on your style, both on the screen and on the set?\n\n\tIn terms of my aesthetic style, I can’t say how I arrived on it because I think that just comes inherently. I love so many movies from Tarantino and Fincher and Director Park [Chan-wook] and surrealist stuff that feels very extreme and full of contrasts. I wanted to imbue the film with a lot of the things that I’m drawn to in my photography, which are strange angles, super close-ups and also super wides that feel a little graphical. I’m always drawn to contradictions and contrasts. This movie has this beautiful small town during a time period that we think of as a little idyllic. It’s also a hippie time. So I wanted to subvert that beauty and show a lot of ugliness. Those two contrasts, both visually and thematically, were very interesting to me.\n\n\tAs far as my directing style, as a human, I believe in being very grateful and being very kind to everybody. I don’t believe that directing requires ruling by fear or condescension. It’s incredibly important to keep people motivated and inspired and happy. I did seek out advice in terms of just management and process on set, and J.J. Abrams was particularly helpful and kind and generous with his recommendations on how to handle on-set logistics and politics. He’s somebody who’s just an incredibly generous person in general, and I had been working with him very closely on the Star Trek stuff at the same time. Honestly, he was the only person I talked to at length about advice. So I just tried to follow my heart in terms of being a human being and extending that on set, and not changing who I am just because it’s a work setting.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat surprised you the most about your first go-round as director? \n\n\tHow energizing it was. I’d only heard how exhausting and terrible it is. I mean, I was working 18 to 20 hour days on this for three years, and I definitely collapsed the day I finished the film. I felt like shit. But for those three years I felt so energized. Even on the longest and toughest days, I just felt grateful and happy and excited and inspired.\n\nOddly enough, I brought up your name in my very first THR interview five-and-a-half years ago. It was with Emily Carmichael for Pacific Rim: Uprising, and I noticed at the time that there were at least a half-dozen female screenwriters working on huge tentpoles. So, from your vantage point, have circumstances improved at all for female screenwriters and directors these last five years? \n\n\tThe statistics say not really, which is really unsettling. I also worked on Pacific Rim with Emily, who’s great. By the way, I met two of my closest friends in the business in the Transformers writers’ room, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Christina Hodson, and they’ve all gone on to do amazing things. By them being more visible, I hope it not only encourages studios and networks to hire more women, but also encourages more women to fight hard to be in those positions. But it’s really scary to me. There was a little bit of a bump right after the Me Too movement. There was a marginal bump in the number of female writers and directors hired, but then it fell off again. So I don’t know exactly what to attribute it to, but it is really disheartening. I won’t name names, but it’s also really disheartening when you look at the female filmmakers who’ve made amazing films and haven’t been rewarded with lifelong careers the way that a lot of men are who’ve made much lesser films.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe industry is in a state of disarray to say the least. Given your background in AI, what’s your take on that issue and the strike? [Writer’s Note: This interview took place before the end of the WGA strike.]\n\n\tI hope there is a swift resolution that is beneficial to all. I know some people see AI as an interesting tool, but I myself see it as a cheat. I would never use AI to help me write a script, no more than I would say, “Hey, writer’s assistant, write half the script for me and then I’ll take credit for it.” (Laughs.) To me, it’s disingenuous and really contrary to the artistic process.\n\nOne minute, they’re saying that they don’t value you enough to give you the contract that you want, but the next minute, they’ll make it known that they apparently do value you enough to have AI scan all of your work. It’s contradictory.\n\n\tIt is. I was just reading an article last night about how CEO jobs are actually the jobs that AI are most adept at replacing, and I can see that because it’s all about optimization. So what’s going on in Hollywood is really just a microcosm for what’s going on everywhere, which is that CEOs everywhere are overpaid compared to the employees that work under them. And there’s a devaluation of not just creative work, but work everywhere and that needs to be addressed.\n\nAnd of all this just compounds the uphill battle that underrepresented writers and directors are already facing.\n\n\tThe critical issues of diversity, AI and the strike are actually all intertwined in that this industry faces an existential crisis unless we prioritize and value the contributions of artists and their authentic experiences. Can AI write a competent script? Yes, it probably can – if not now, very soon. A friend recently typed into ChatGPT, “Give me a new season of a [long-running TV show I won’t name],” and in seconds, not minutes, it spewed out a convincing season arc that would have taken a writers’ room weeks to months to come up with. These were just summaries, not full scripts. I’m sure the ChatGPT scripts of today would be filled with oddities and errors that a human would have to revise and make sense of, but in a few years, undoubtedly the scripts will be serviceable. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThis efficiency cannot replace the sheer magic of a writers’ room, where writers treat the story-breaking process like therapy and infuse their real-life, relatable experiences. Contributors are moved to laughter or tears in the room, as audiences then are in turn when watching these real-life moments infused into shows. We need more realness and humanity in our stories, not less. Our industry cannot survive on “serviceable” content. Competent, coherent-enough plot lines aren’t enough to capture audience attention for long. We have seen what has happened to the film industry and what IP-driven studio filmmaking by committee has given us: the near-death of an industry, and viewer fatigue even for what once was the most shiny of IP. \n\n\tWhat has been the shining hope this summer? Barbie and Oppenheimer. Two movies that were filmmaker-driven, with very specific and authentic points of view. Movies that were not and could not have been made by committee. I have no doubt that there are men who could have written and directed a very funny Barbie movie, but it wouldn’t have been the phenomenon that was Barbie, because Greta Gerwig tapped into her authentic experience as a woman navigating the patriarchy in a way that made women all over the world laugh and cry. Just as only someone with an authentic Black POV could give us the genius that is Get Out. \n\n\tWhen studios value and trust in creatives, magic can happen. This is why we need more female and diverse filmmakers and writers. When an artist can tap into their experiences in a real way, rather than regurgitate things they’ve seen on screen, audiences can feel it. If we start giving liberties to a more diverse set of artists to tell their human, diverse stories, people will tune in. Stories will feel different and engaging, and touch us in ways we can’t explain. Audiences will show up because something will have been created that looks like a delightful surprise, something they haven’t seen before. Cinema will be saved by original stories or original takes on IP, from creatives from a wide array of backgrounds and experiences. Replacing human writers with AI, even if feasible, would not just mean the death of writers; I believe it would mean the ultimate death of the industry.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you say what was supposed to be next?\n\n\tI can’t say too much about all the stuff in my life, but I turned in the first draft of Sleepy Hollow before the strike started. It’s something that I’m writing, directing and producing, and I’m excited to get back to that after the strike is over.\n\n\t***Pet Sematary: Bloodlines debuts October 6th on Paramount+.

Fuller, Shudder and Steakhaus Productions didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\tWineman produced Queer for Fear, a docuseries about the relationship between queer audiences and horror. He alleges he was prematurely terminated by Fuller, who executive produced the title and allegedly reduced Wineman’s credits on the show “as a final act of retaliation,” according to the complaint.\n\n\tThe lawsuit claims Fuller sexually assaulted Wineman “several times” in 2021 during the production of the series. Under the guise of cracking Wineman’s back, Fuller “pressed his penis against plaintiff’s buttocks” and held it there so “plaintiff could feel it through the fabric” of his pants,” the lawsuit states.\n\n\tWineman also says Fuller’s “preoccupation with masturbation permeated everything.” The complaint claims that Fuller “frequently brought up his penis,” whether it was “reading material that gave him erections,” actors that he “masturbated so much to” or “adult/child power dynamics in stories that he was ‘wanking it to.'”\n\n\tThe allegedly hostile work environment extended to “relentless verbal harassment and casual bullying,” the lawsuit says. Wineman alleges that Fuller often berated him until he cried and retaliated against him by sabotaging shots, heckling interviewees and ignoring him for weeks at a time. The complaint adds that Fuller “made discriminatory comments targeting groups that crew and interviewees belonged to, plaintiff included, frequently proclaiming his hatred of all gay men.”\n\n\tThe complaint alleges quid pro quo sexual harassment, retaliation, harassment and hostile work environment and negligent hiring, among other claims.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nUnique expertise on how the law impacts Hollywood pros, projects and processes\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

{"title": "‘Totally Killer’ Review: Kiernan Shipka in a Fun-Enough Time-Traveling ’80s Slasher Flick", "date": "2023-10-06 00:02:36", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nNahnatchka Khan directs Blumhouse's horror-comedy about a Gen Z teen who accidentally time-travels to the 1980s, where she tries to stop a serial killer's spree before it ever begins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tAngie Han\n\nTelevision Critic\n\n\tThe easiest way to describe Totally Killer is by listing all the other movies it calls to mind. Plot-wise, it’s a Back to the Future-style time travel adventure crossed with a Halloween-inspired slasher, all cast in a Scream-lite sense of self-awareness; tonally, its mashup of comedy and horror lands in the same general area as The Final Girls or the Happy Death Day movies.\n\n\tIf it its ingredients feel familiar, however, the script (by David Matalon, Sasha Perl-Raver and Jen D’Angelo) injects them with just enough heart and humor to keep them from feeling stale.

Johnson, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Nathaniel Appiah and Jonathan Potts, Randall Park, Julie Bowen\nDirector: Nahnatchka Khan\nScreenwriters: David Matalon, Sasha Perl-Raver, Jen D'Angelo\n\n\tIts unwitting Marty McFly is Jamie (Kiernan Shipka), a stereotypically rebellious teenager whose stereotypically overprotective parents (Julie Bowen and Lochlyn Munro) have more reason than most to be paranoid: 35 years ago, when they were still in high school, three of their friends were murdered in a single week. Their worst fears are realized when the still-unidentified Sweet Sixteen Killer returns to claim another victim on Halloween 2022. As he sets his sights on Jamie, she takes shelter in a time machine that hurls her back to 1987, via some endearingly chintzy graphics.\n\n\tThe unplanned journey inevitably sets up a clash of Gen Z and Gen X sensibilities, and Totally Killer plays out most of the expected beats. Jamie groans at the formerly racist school mascot, cringes at the overtly misogynistic language of her parents’ generation, coughs at the omnipresent clouds of cigarette smoke. There are a few clever subversions, like when Jamie unknowingly scarfs half a dozen pot brownies, only to find herself totally unaffected because “’80s weed sucks.” And the requisite Q&A about the future takes a wry ’20s turn when Jamie explains that no, the machines do not end up killing us all a la Terminator or RoboCop — “they more just rip apart the fabric of our society through dance videos on TikTok.”\n\n\tNone of its observations about the generational divide are really sharp enough to draw blood, however. This is neither a Gen Z satire like Bodies Bodies Bodies nor a Gen X nostalgia trip like Stranger Things. The film is more about actual blood. Though Jamie spends her stay in 1987 trying to stop the killings before they happen, largely by trying to befriend the victims so she can persuade them to make different choices, she’s more successful at changing the details of the murders than preventing them altogether. Totally Killer could probably stand to be a bit gorier, given its R rating, but its spurts of violence are paced at a brisk enough clip to keep a viewer engaged throughout its 103 minutes.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, its time-travel shenanigans are played with a cheerful light touch. In the present, Jamie’s tech-whiz best friend, Amelia (Kelcey Mawema), works on fixing the time machine so Jamie can come home; in the past, Amelia’s even more brilliant future mother, Lauren (Troy L. Johnson), does the same. Both are surprisingly blasé about the whole affair. “You don’t start trying to invent time travel without considering the possibility that people from the future wil need your help,” Lauren shrugs when Jamie expresses surprise at how well she’s taking all of this. As with most time travel movies, the plot mechanics work best if you don’t think about them too hard, especially toward the end. They hang together just well enough while it matters to add an extra jolt of urgency to Jamie’s timeline-altering quest.\n\n\tAnd, sometimes, an extra tinge of poignancy. Totally Killer isn’t an especially emotional movie. To the contrary, everyone in its version of the 1980s is so unmoved even by the shocking events unfolding within it that the one time a guy weeps over his girlfriend’s death, a newscaster deems the display “fascinating.” But it locates a beating heart in the evolving bond between Jamie and Pam (Olivia Holt), her mother’s younger self. The pair aren’t exactly buddies to start. Jamie’s horrified to discover that Pam is an archetypal mean girl who thinks it “hilarious” to trick a social outcast into believing a popular boy likes her. (Carrie would have existed by this point, but maybe Pam never watched it?) For her part, Pam is understandably weirded out by the stranger barging into her friends’ lives out of nowhere, bearing bizarre warnings about impending doom.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBut the adventure puts Jamie in the position of trying to protect the very same person whose protection she’ll shrug off 35 years later, and in doing so forces her to see Pam in a new light. Shipka is charming as a thoroughly modern heroine who can slip between baseball-bat-toting badassery and heart-on-sleeve sincerity — and though Pam’s response to the latter is to scoff that “nobody wants to hear you talk about how much you love your mom,” Holt shades her with just enough vulnerability that we can see the caring woman she’ll become underneath the queen-bitch teen she is currently. \n\n\tTheir nascent friendship makes Totally Killer easy to root for, even when its jokes don’t land as sharply as they could or its kills fail to leave a memorable impression. It also makes the film feel surprisingly wholesome, despite all the bloodletting and the horny teen hookups and the seemingly endless supply of weed and beer. It might even make you, by the end of it all, want to call your mom and tell her that you love her.\nDistributor: Amazon Studios\nProduction companies: Blumhouse Television, Divide/Conquer, Fierce Baby Productions\nCast: Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Charlie Gillespie, Lochlyn Munro, Troy L.

But she claims Derulo repeatedly pressured her to drink and have sex with him, alleging there was an “explicit demand for sex-in-exchange-for-success.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Black Keys, Jason Derulo to Perform at NFL TikTok Tailgate Ahead of Super Bowl\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJason Derulo Exits CAA for UTA (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAmong many claims, the lawsuit alleges that at one point Derulo told Gibson that if she wanted to be successful in “this business” she “would be required to partake in ‘goat skin and fish scales,’ which is a Haitian reference to conducting sex rituals, sacrificing a goat, goat blood and doing cocaine.'” The lawsuit claims that “the manner and timing of such a statement meant that Derulo was demanding sexual acts from [Gibson] in order for Derulo to fulfill his role as her mentor, supervisor and musical collaborator.”\n\n\tIn the complaint, Gibson alleges that Derulo would often schedule late night (9 p.m. to 2 a.m.) studio sessions and repeatedly invite her to drinks. The lawsuit claims Derulo “constantly pressured [Gibson] to drink with him despite [Gibson] repeatedly expressing she’s not a drinker. As a pretext, Derulo would “assure” [Gibson] he would arrange for an Uber to take her home.”\n\n\tIn another incident, the lawsuit claims that during a late-night recording session, Derulo again asked Gibson to have a drink with him. Gibson “reluctantly” agreed to have a drink with Derulo, but she was given “inappropriately large amounts of alcohol,” the suit says. “After this session, where [Gibson] declined to drink and have sex with Derulo, the offer to arrange for [Gibson] to get to and from Derulo’s studio ceased,” the complaint says.\n\n\tThe lawsuit says Derulo eventually stopped responding to Gibson’s messages and that in September 2022 she was dropped by Future History and Atlantic. \n\n\tAlong with Derulo and Future History, the complaint lists Atlantic Records (which has a joint venture with Future History), Derulo’s manager Frank Harris and RCA Records as defendants.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with NBC News, Gibson said the whole situation was “very heartbreaking.” “I have anxiety; I’m traumatized. I’ve dealt with inhumane work situations.… I’m at this point where I’m back to zero and I have nothing,” Gibson said. \n\n\tOn Thursday night, in a clip posted to Instagram, Derulo addressed the allegations without going into the specifics of Gibson’s claims. \n\n\t“I wouldn’t normally comment but these claims are completely false and hurtful,” Derulo said in a statement posted to his Instagram. “I stand against all forms of harassment and I remain supportive of anybody following their dreams.”\n\n\tHe added, “I’ve always strived to live my life in a positively impactful way, and that’s why I sit here before you deeply offended, by these defamatory claims.

But there are plans to build seven studio stages that would provide a total of 150,000 square-foot of space (the biggest stage coming in at 30,000 square-feet), plus a further 90,000 square-feet of workshop and office space, with construction work set to start in spring 2024 and full completion anticipated by July 2025. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKilian Paris Closes Out Paris Fashion Week With Star-Studded, \"Smoking Hot\" Soirée\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWalt Disney Animation Studios' Jennifer Lee Talks 'Frozen 3,' 'Wish' and Relying on 'Cinderella' as an Escape When She Was Bullied in School\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe development — which Dunleavy says will cost “tens of millions of dollars” — would make Tara Studios Ireland’s largest facility for film and TV productions (a title currently held by Troy Studios, which boasts 100,000 square-foot across four stages and was the home of Apple TV+ sci-fi series Foundation).\n\n\tThe project is being fronted Dunleavy and veteran film financier John Gleeson, who heads up the Dublin office of Saffery, with the two hoping to tap into the significant demand for stage space in Ireland. The country has has long been a destination for major shoots that have taken advantage of its locations — recent significant productions include Cocaine Bear, Vikings: Valhalla, The Banshees of Inisherin and Bad Sisters — but has lacked in studio facilities.\n\n\t“The most recent projection is that around one million square feet of stage space is needed, and currently there’s about a quarter of a million,” explains Dunleavy.\n\n\tFinding the location for Tara Studios — named after a nearby hill — took Dunleavy and Gleeson around two years, with a key factor being its proximity to Dublin, to airports, and also to four- and five-star hotels for crews. Dunleavy also notes that there’s “complete privacy” on the estate, which isn’t visible from the road, offering the seclusion to build a backlot away from prying eyes.\n\n\tAnd in taking over Borleagh Manor — which went up for sale in 2020 and contains walled gardens and a stable yard alongside a grand manor house — Dunleavy and Gleeson have also tapped into a slice of Hollywood folklore, with the 18th-century estate once owned by 1950s matinee idol star Richard Greene, best known for playing the lead in British TV series The Adventures of Robin Hood. It’s said that Greene hosted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Cary Grant and Richard Burton there. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“There are lots of reports of Hollywood celebrities turning up at the house and enjoying dinners,” notes Dunleavy, who adds that they’ve honored its film connections by putting various images of its former owner on display. \n\n\tThe opening of Tara Studios comes at an anxious time for the industry, with streamers pulling back from the major spending on content that had driven so much of the demand for studio space and the actors strike having brought many productions to a standstill. But Dunleavy says he has little concern about attracting interest in his new venture.\n\n\t“I thin the global demand for new content has continued to rise. There have been a couple of obvious impacts, but the consumption of new material in the pandemic has got people in the habit of watching more, and the ebb and flow of larger projects versus smaller projects has been a factor in TV for decades,” he says. “I don’t think that would cause me any concern. Particular players will be up and down at any particular moment in time.”\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Mailbag\n\n\tWhy don’t streamers want to reveal ratings? And if broadcast shows are so popular on streaming, why don’t the platforms actually make broadcast shows themselves?\n\n2. October TV preview\n\n\tThe broadcast fare that typically returns in late September/early October is MIA as this month’s picks range from Loki, Frasier and spooky fare.\n\n3. Cancellation round-up\n\n\tThis week, a favorite of TV’s Top 5 — Max’s Sort Of — revealed it was wrapping its run after three seasons. Elsewhere, Paramount+ axed its iCarly revival. With that in mind, we review some of the big cancellations and shows/seasons that were outright scrapped during the past few months that we neglected to discuss because, well, the WGA strike took priority. And what’s more, this speaks to the larger trend of industry-wide contraction that began well before Hollywood’s labor unrest. Some of these were tied to the broadcast upfronts back in May, others happened more recently amid wholesale changes that came as a result of scaled back budgets and new priorities at networks and streamers. \n\n4. Best TV of the 21st Century\n\nTHR TV critics Angie Han and Robyn Bahr join the show this week to discuss how they — and Dan, of course — selected the best 50 TV shows of the 21st century. As it turns out, Mad Men was an easy pick for No. 1 but the rest of the list required hours of debate and discussion. Plus why shows like Friends didn’t make the cut.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Critic’s Corner\n\n\tAs usual, we end with Dan’s thoughts on this week’s new and returning series. In this episode, he weighs in on Loki, Our Flag Means Death, Bargain, Found and more.\n\n\tHear it all now on TV’s Top 5. Be sure to subscribe to the podcast to never miss an episode.

Over the course of his career, he also opened restaurants like Bottega and Ottimo.

Del Toro was working on the project with screenwriter David S. Goyer, who first teased the news last month on the Happy Sad Confused podcast.\n\n\t“There was just a lot of behind [the scenes] stuff going on at Lucasfilm at the time,” Goyer said on the podcast. “But it’s a cool script.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCapri, Hollywood Film Fest: Italian Oscar Entry 'Io Capitano,' About African Migrants, to Receive Humanitarian Award\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney's 'Moving' Sweeps Busan Film Festival's Asia Contents Awards \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn response, Del Toro tweeted at the time: “True. Can’t say much. Maybe two letters ‘J’ and ‘BB’ is that three letters?”\n\n\tNow, Del Toro has confirmed that the project did, in fact, revolve around Jabba.\n\n\t“We had the rise and fall of Jabba the Hutt, so I was super happy,” he said during the recent Collider event. “We were doing a lot of stuff, and then it’s not my property, it’s not my money, and then it’s one of those 30 screenplays that goes away. Sometimes I’m bitter, sometimes I’m not. I always turn to my team and say, ‘Good practice, guys. Good practice. We designed a great world. We designed great stuff. We learned.'”\n\n\tBut, alas, it wasn’t meant to be. Lucasfilm didn’t move forward with the project. Del Toro, though, has no hard feelings.\n\n\t“You can never be ungrateful with life,” he said. “Whatever life sends you, there’s something to be learned from it. So, you know, I trust the universe, I do. When something doesn’t happen, I go, ‘Why?’ I try to have a dialogue with myself. ‘Why didn’t it happen?’ And the more you swim upstream with the universe, the less you’re gonna realize where you’re going.”\n\n\tWhile it’s unclear exactly how long ago Del Toro and Goyer were working on the project, not getting a chance to direct a Star Wars movie obviously hasn’t hindered Del Toro’s career: He’s won three Oscars, two for The Shape of Water (best picture and best director) and one for Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio (best animated feature). For his part, Goyer has been involved with numerous superhero films, including The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice along with Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tJabba, meanwhile, has appeared in several Star Wars movies and on TV. He was first introduced in 1983’s Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi. He also was later added to Star Wars: Episode IV – a New Hope when the film was rereleased for its 20th anniversary in 1997, via a previously unfinished scene.

The award will be accepted in-person by Garrone and the film’s stars, Seydou Sarr and Moustapha Fall.\n\n\tThe film — which premiered in September at the Venice International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Silver Lion for the direction by Garrone (2008’s Gomorrah) and the Marcello Mastroianni Award for the performance by Sarr — tells the story of a Senegalese teenager’s desperate quest to get from Dakar to Europe.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney's 'Moving' Sweeps Busan Film Festival's Asia Contents Awards \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGreta Gerwig Says She Hid in the Back of 'Barbie' Screenings During Its Opening Weekend, Teases New Project\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Io Capitano is well deserving of the Capri Humanitarian Award, as it is an important work of art encouraging inclusion and solidarity among human beings and shows the utmost respect for individuality and cultural diversity,” the Oscar-winning screenwriter Bobby Moresco, who is the honorary chair of this year’s Capri, Hollywood fest, said in a statement. “The film emphasizes the importance of brotherhood and the need for sensitivity towards those whose existence is laden with discomfort and distress in large parts of the world, and whose struggle for a better life needs to be acknowledged and supported by the rest of the world.”\n\n\tFest founder-director Pascal Vicedomini, who previously dedicated the 2016 edition of the fest to African migrants, added in a statement: “We’re pleased to warmly welcome the protagonists of a work that has touched the hearts of international audiences beyond all expectations.

Aside from its market-oriented aspect, MIA aims to be, first and foremost, a place where the most influential people in the audiovisual sector can meet.  \n\n\tThe goal for this year’s edition, which opened on Monday and runs through Friday, Oct. 13, is to expand the scope and increase the event’s range and offerings.\n\n\n\n\tAs per usual, content is the starting point. For this reason, further visibility and resources have been allotted to the MIA XR section that explores and delves into the technological innovations in the movie and TV industries, ranging from special effects to virtual reality. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCapri, Hollywood Film Fest: Italian Oscar Entry 'Io Capitano,' About African Migrants, to Receive Humanitarian Award\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGuillermo del Toro Confirms He Was Working on a Now-Scrapped 'Star Wars' Movie About Jabba the Hutt\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe same vision to enrich and enhance the content offered has been extended to the animation subdivision, which launched last year with success. “We wanted to try and explore the creative possibilities that technology can give producers,” said MIA Market director Gaia Tridente.\n\n\tFramed by the historic Palazzo Barberini in Rome where the MIA Market found its home, between the VR installations, the various set-ups and historical rooms, the space is truly impressive even at first glance. Guests welcomed this year in this space dedicated to technology include Marvel VFX supervisor Jake Morrison. \n\n\tIn addition to putting a spotlight on the future, Tridente emphasized that it was also important to stick to the path traced in previous editions, maintaining the market’s four pillars: movies, dramas, animation and documentaries.\n\n\tWhat is new for this year’s edition? Among other things, an attempt to introduce proper forums dedicated to factual entertainment. Another fundamental aspect this year will be the MIA Buyers’ Club, focused on movie distribution in theaters. Plus, a new subdivision dedicated to projects in development, “Comin’ Up,” will be introduced. Here, Tridente said the attempt will be made to predict what projects are going to be completed and distributed in the months following the event.\n\n\tCo-produced projects will likewise receive much visibility and focus, thanks to an entire dedicated floor within Palazzo Barberini. Many of this year’s main guests are seasoned female producers, such as Nicole Clemens from Paramount and Marge Dean from Skybound Entertainment. Representatives from the Scandinavian, Spanish and Italian markets will also discuss European productions for Netflix.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“This is the embodiment of MIA Market: paying attention to the present as well as the future,” emphasized Tridente. For this reason, she explained, even smaller players from all over the world will be given considerable space. “We want to represent the whole world,” she highlighted. \n\n\tAnimation in particular is going to be one of the key content areas in focus. “When we launched our subdivision last year, we wanted to explore this form of expression in its entirety, first of all,” said Tridente. “And I believe we’ve succeeded in engaging the most important players. The future of animation is going to be essential for the growth of the entire industry.”\n\n\tThe Hollywood strikes involving screenwriters and actors have not, she says, affected this year’s planning. “We hope that these issues will be solved soon and that the value of all workers in this industry will be acknowledged. MIA Market is not a festival, therefore it wasn’t undermined by these events,” explained Tridente. \n\n\tAnd she emphasized that the 2023 edition of the MIA Market will continue to push its international reach and flair, facilitating encounters amongst all sorts of parties, and not merely with Italian producers and institutions.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
{"title": "Meet Tom Brady’s Hollywood Marketing Machine: Shadow Lion", "date": "2023-10-09 13:05:00", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nWith work for brands like Hasbro and EA Sports under its belt, the creative studio launched to support the former NFL star's off-field ambitions has expanded well beyond the quarterback's social channels.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tAshley Cullins\n\nSenior Business Editor\n\n\tWell before NFL star Tom Brady retired from professional football, his off-field legacy was beginning to take shape through a business that’s grown from a handful of people dedicated to optimizing the quarterback’s social media opportunities to a multidimensional creative studio with about 20 employees across the country.\n\n\tThe company is called Shadow Lion, and it was founded in 2017 by a core team including Brady’s longtime manager Ben Rawitz, Jeff Fine (who happens to be Rawitz’s brother), and Gilad Haas who previously worked for Brady’s New England Patriots teammate Julian Edelman. The firm is one of a few celebrity founded marketing agencies — think: Ryan Reynolds’ Maximum Effort — that have cropped up in recent years. \n\n\tThe buzzy Hertz commercials? That was them. The Emmy-winning series Tom vs. Time? They worked on that, alongside Religion of Sports, too.\n\n\tBut in the years since the creative studio was founded to advance Brady’s off-field endeavors, they’ve expanded well beyond the lion’s shadow, so to speak. They’re focusing on audience-specific content, whether that’s a 10-second social clip or a 30-minute docuseries, and aspire to be a household name when it comes to creating standout creative work, similar to what A24 is doing in Hollywood. They’ve built a roster of clients including some of the biggest brands out there, like Pepsi, Hasbro, Under Armour, Aston Martin, Meta, Peacock and the NFL, and have worked with elite athletes like JJ Watt, Zdeno Chára and Mookie Betts.\n\n\t“When you see a Shadow Lion project, whether it’s a campaign for a brand, or a film, TV or audio project, we want it to be synonymous with quality,” says Haas, Shadow Lion’s managing director. “We want people to seek out the things we’re producing because they’re fans of the creatives we have and the content we produce.” (With multiple yet-to-be-announced original content projects in the pipeline, they’re well on their way.)\n\n\tRawitz, Fine and Haas talked with The Hollywood Reporter about how Madden 2018 sparked the launch of Shadow Lion, why “ego is the enemy” and where the company is headed next. \n\nHow was Shadow Lion formed?\n\nBen Rawitz: I’ve been working with Tom Brady for the last 15-plus years. It was an operation of really just me, Tom, and his agent. We needed some extra help in Tom’s world as social media was growing and my brother Jeff was graduating college at that time. Jeff came on in 2013 to support Tom, myself and everything else that was going on.\n\nJeff Fine: For a couple years there we were just helping build Tom’s presence on social media, which was just Facebook at this point. In general, people like Tom were gaining control over their story and these channels were growing. There were a lot of opportunities to work closely with brands. Gilad was working with Julian Edelman at the time and a mutual friend introduced us. We had seen some of each others’ videos and immediately hit it off. It was a no-brainer to figure out a way to work together. That was really the birth of the idea of starting the company. We were all interested in a creative career and in building something. \n\nRawitz: There was a natural progression on the deal side with athletes in general, not just Tom, where athletes’ social media were becoming part of deals. Companies and brands wanted to own a part of social media, which was great because the athlete can use their own voice and make it more authentic. So it was a win-win.\n\nGilad Haas: Within the first couple months we had an opportunity beyond Tom’s social, and maintaining that organically, to work with a commercial partner in EA Sports. They were launching Tom on the cover of Madden 2018. They weren’t entirely sure how to announce it, but they knew they wanted to do something special and to take advantage of Tom’s momentum and growth on his social channels. We ended up producing two pieces of content for them with Tom in 45 minutes and they became Tom’s highest engaging branded content thus far. It set off a light bulb for Tom and for us that there was an opportunity here to create really high-quality and engaging content, and ensure that time-on-task for talent is incredibly efficient. It was a catalyst to us formally creating Shadow Lion in August of 2017.\n\nWhy go beyond Tom? Because his business alone would be enough for you guys to keep busy.\n\nHaas: As we were working more in Tom’s world, we were coming across other athletes and brands who were familiar with the work we had produced without knowing we had produced it. It just kind of seemed like a natural next step for us. We felt like we had the bandwidth to do more, and there were new opportunities for us. As storytellers, there is an innate curiosity in all of us at Shadow Lion, and I think  that curiosity can’t be fed through working on Tom-exclusive projects. The opportunity to branch out was going to be something that fueled us and created some fulfillment beyond what we were doing day-to-day for Tom.\n\nRawitz: There was also a shoot with Uggs, I remember. They had spent months on end trying to come up with a concept that would fit for Tom and they were paying a big agency. Ultimately it was like, “Hey, can you guys concept some ideas?” Because we know Tom, and at that point we had a great understanding of Uggs, we were able to come up with some great ideas and use Tom’s time-on-task. I think we saw that there’s a need for this kind of internal, almost from the athlete’s perspective, storytelling.\n\nFine: We have had an interest from the very beginning in growing as people and as creatives and have interests outside of sports. We see how growing different creative experiences can help enrich the work that we do with Tom. It’ll help us grow the team, help us produce at a high level. It is, in a way, as simple as that: We want it to grow.\n\nHow has Shadow Lion grown since then and what does the business look like today?\n\nHaas: At the beginning it was kind of exclusively oriented around Tom and his world. There are three main arms of our business now. There’s the agency side of our business where we continue to support Tom across his off-field opportunities and we work with elite athletes and entertainers and other figures in a similar capacity. We’re the social agency of record for a couple of large brands, and we do social strategy and execution as one-off projects for large brands. Then the other side of our business is original content, ideating, developing, packaging, producing and executing on unscripted, scripted and audio content.\n\n\tSandwiched between those two arms, agency and original content, is our production team. That’s really enabled us to handle everything internally. When you’re working in the digital marketing landscape and original content, being able to move fast and ensure the quality and end product is what you want it to be is super important. The ability for us to handle a lot of that production internally has really benefited us in our growth. \n\nWhat do you consider some of your biggest success stories so far?\n\nRawitz: To me, the biggest success is the people here at Shadow Lion and the vibe in the office. Everybody gets excited about coming to work every day. It’s one of the best environments I’ve been in. So, to me personally, it’s the people in this family at Shadow Lion.\n\nFine: I would definitely echo that. We’ve really built a team that cares about each other as people and it extends to the work. The through line is just the relationships. It’s nice to have that as a baseline in everything you do. We want everything we work on to be the best it can be and that really carries through and drives our growth as people and as a company.\n\nHaas: We talked a lot about Tom’s social media for obvious reasons. What we’ve demonstrated there was the biggest proof of concept that we needed to show other folks what we were capable of doing. [Tom is] one of the most transcendent generational athletes, also known for extreme privacy and eliminating distractions on the field, and being able to create a consistent, creative and engaging social presence for him is something that we all have taken pride in. \n\n\tEA Sports has brought us back every single year pretty much since that inception project that we did with Tom, helping them announce their ratings week or helping them with in-game content in Madden 23 this past year with Chad Ochocinco. We did a doc series on Zdeno Chára, who was captain of the Boston Bruins, that was on Peacock. Being able to follow him for two years and tell his story helped us really set a foundation for everything that’s to come and reinvigorated the whole team. There’s Team Impact, which is a charity that pairs chronically ill children with athletic programs at colleges and universities and makes them official teammates of those teams. We’re excited at the potential of taking a larger role with them, and we’ve been able to see that what we produce has materially affected kids’ lives. \n\n\tEchoing Ben and Jeff on the culture at Shadow Lion, the ability to go into work every day and never have the Sunday scaries, to support your teammates and treat everybody with respect is something that I think  is rare. It doesn’t really matter who came up with the idea. For us, ego is the enemy and our goal is to create a space for creatives to thrive.\n\nWhat do you see for the future of the company?\n\nHaas: We’re super excited about for what’s to come. I outlined the three buckets for us, as far as what we do between original content production and agency work. What we’re really excited about is to scale all three of those and maintain the quality of work. We have some fun and exciting opportunities on the agency side that we’re really excited about to continue to grow that team. We look at the scripted space as an opportunity that we’re excited to dip our toes into next year, and the audio space is a big one that we plan to make a move into toward the end of this year as well. \n\n\t[Internally], it’s to continue to build a space for creative talent and people to come and flex their muscles and maybe skip some rungs in the ladder and produce really great quality content at a high level and not necessarily have to go through the bureaucratic process that some legacy agencies or bigger companies might have as part of their formal process. We’re excited to open new locations in new cities and hopefully appeal to talent in those locations. The goal is really for us to grow our team, maintain our culture, maintain our quality and continue to cement Shadow Lion as a brand known for quality storytelling, quality content, quality creative and quality people.\n\nIs there anything else about Shadow Lion that you really want people to know right now?\n\nFine: One note just to build on what Gilad was talking about; I think from the very beginning we’ve seen this as a space for people and for creatives to thrive and grow. It’s not lost on us how fortunate we are to get the opportunity to create and have our work seen. We’re all sports fans since we were younger, and to be able to put out content with Tom, for instance, around some of these amazing moments that are just so emotional and wonderful is an amazing opportunity. \n\n\tSomething we realized early on, or at least I know I felt, was that any of my friends could be doing what I’m doing right now. They just don’t necessarily have the opportunity, and I think that runs through a lot of what we do. We feel like people can, if given the opportunity, really put out amazing work. Putting people in positions to succeed and have opportunities to do their best work, and the support system to do it, is central to everything we do. Some of my proudest feelings around the company are seeing how the people here have grown in just the last few years and thinking about the trajectory of that growth. It happens with every project and we’re constantly making bets on ourselves that are a little outside of our comfort zone because we believe we can do it. That’s always paid off for us because we believe we can rise to the occasion and we tend to. More people can do this type of work than tend to get the opportunities, and it’s cool to have the opportunity to do so.\n\nInterview edited for length and clarity.\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Trian is expected to request multiple seats on Disney’s board of directors, including one for Peltz, the source says.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDoes Disney's Management of Hulu and ESPN Violate Antitrust Laws?

The source added that Trian gave Disney and Iger time to turn the company around after the CEO announced a turnaround plan back in February, but that the stock slump spurred on the decision to make a new board play.\n\n\tThe fund feels the Disney board should strengthen its alignment with shareholders given Disney’s stock has fallen from around $113 in early February to $82.94 as of Friday’s market close.\n\n\tPeltz abandoned his attempt to win representation on Disney’s board after the company unveiled major cost cuts and other initiatives under Iger. “This was a great win for all the shareholders. Management at Disney now plans to do everything that we wanted them to do,” Peltz said on CNBC back then. However, he also emphasized that Disney and Iger had to deliver on their promises.\n\n\tDisney back then said: “We are pleased that our board and management can remain focused without the distraction of a proxy contest, and we have tremendous faith in Bob Iger’s leadership and the transformative vision for Disney’s future he set forth.”\n\n\tIt has since then been exploring strategic alternatives for such assets as Hulu, its broadcast business and its Indian operations.\n\n\tOne thing that is not clear in the new Trian effort is whether former Marvel chairman Ike Perlmutter is involved. Perlmutter — a friend of Peltz’s and a fellow Palm Beach resident — was involved in the last proxy fight, and held millions of Disney shares. It is now known how much is stake is currently.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPerlmutter was laid off from Disney’s Marvel Entertainment division (not associated with Marvel Studios) in March.\n\n\t“I have long expected that my working relationship with Disney would end. That it should come as a result of my trying to help Disney improve its business should sadden many shareholders as it does me, the company’s largest individual shareholder,” Perlmutter said in a statement after the termination.\n\n\tA spokesperson for Trian declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported Peltz’s new push.\n\n\tMeanwhile, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon last week initiated coverage of the media and telcom sector, with Disney as one of his two favorite stocks, rating it at “outperform” with a $103 stock price target. Calling Disney “the only credible challenger to Netflix,” he said that “we are bullish on Disney’s potential to transition to direct-to-consumer at scale once combined with Hulu.” He added about Hulu: “Disney has more to gain with full control of the asset, and (a) favorable resolution of the deal (with Comcast) will likely lift a modest overhang on the stock.”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Discovery. \n\n\tAccording to letter signatories including Jason Blum (M3GAN), Effie Brown (Dear White People), Nina Jacobson (The Hunger Games), Dede Gardner (She Said), Todd Black (The Equalizer 3) and Stacey Sher (The Hateful Eight), the AMPTP has “unjustly lumped producers into the organization’s positions” and that the negotiations have “led to confusion” and “negatively affect producers in multiple ways beond their control.” THR has asked the AMPTP for comment on the letter.\n\n\tThat independent producers are not a part of the AMPTP is a drum that many in the role have been beating for years amid myriad labor battles, though producers were particularly outspoken about the topic during the 2023 writers’ and actors’ strikes. The work stoppages, involving tens of thousands of actors and writers, thrust the often-opaque trade organization the AMPTP into the spotlight. Following remarks that Sean Penn made at Cannes Film Festival in May, in which he confused the Producers Guild of America trade organization with the AMPTP, satirically calling the former the “Bankers’ Guild,” PGA presidents Stephanie Allain (Hustle & Flow) and Donald De Line (Ready Player One) clarified the difference between the two organizations in a THR as-told-to guest column. “We’re a collection of individual producers, as opposed to a collection of for-profit companies,” they explained.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTuesday’s letter, on the other hand, originated with a Change.org petition from the Producers Union, a group of creative fiction film producers that is attempting to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining. Producers, who are largely non-union, do not have one go-to healthcare solution, minimum wage rates or other benefits that are characteristic of organized labor. “We’re not representatives of the struck companies. Most of us don’t have deals with them. Most of us don’t have our bills paid by them. We’re not at the table the negotiations. So we really wanted to start changing that narrative and it’s just slowly taken off,” explains Laura Lewis (Tell Me Lies), a Producers Union executive committee member and one of the organizers of the letter. She adds, “We have just as many issues with those member companies as they [writers and actors] do.”\n\n\tIn a statement on Tuesday, the PGA said, “The Producers Guild supports the efforts of the Producers Union and all producers advocating for the basic rights of producers including fair compensation, access to essential benefits and healthcare.”\n\n\tThe Producers Union, an effort that launched in 2021 amid challenges presented to the profession by the COVID-19 pandemic, has only 100-200 members so far. “The first couple of years were [about] ratifying a constitution and figuring out the legalities of it,” says Lewis. “I would say we’re now in phase two, which is growing the membership and we’re still in early nascent stages of that, but we need numbers in order to get support and that’s the goal.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSo far, the AMPTP has not responded to the letter, according to organizers, and Lewis admits that she doesn’t know if the organization ever will. “We’d love to have a conversation with Carol [Lombardini], but if at a minimum we just raise more awareness about the fact that there is this distinction and also that producers don’t get the bare minimum that every other guild member gets, then we’ve started making a case for our cause.” She added, “So that’s our ultimate goal, is to make more people aware of our plight, too.”\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

She also won the American Cup all-around competition for the third and final time that year before retiring from the sport in 1986.\n\n\tFollowing retirement and being named Sports Illustrated’s Sportswoman of the Year in 1984, Retton went on to work in television and be a motivational speaker.

She also competed on season 27 of Dancing with the Stars.\n\n\tSeveral years later, in 1997, Retton was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame as well.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

She points to discrepancies in how her firing was handled opposed to several male producers and editors of the program who’ve allegedly been the subject of various complaints for sexual harassment.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJo Ling Kent Joins CBS News as Senior Business and Technology Correspondent\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCBS News Preps Podcast on Russian Double Agent Robert Hanssen From Major Garrett (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccording to the complaint, “sexism and misogyny defined the workplace” at the network. She cites sexual misconduct and harassment claims against former CBS chairman Leslie Moonves, ex-network anchor Charlie Rose and former 60 Minutes executive producer Don Hewitt, as well as several other current producers on the program.\n\n\tPoolos was let go without severance last year after an associate producer she supervised reported her for being a “bully” who didn’t “respect boundaries,” the lawsuit says. In a memo, CBS stated it terminated her for harassment, discussing the complaining employee’s complaints with others and not being truthful, according to the complaint.\n\n\tPoolos argues CBS applied uneven standards to fire her, compared with male employees. She says that the network initiated a “bogus investigation,” failing to adhere to nondiscrimination policies that require CBS to include review of all evidence collected.\n\n\t“Poolos is not aware of CBS firing male 60 Minutes employees based on a single complaint from a subordinate about behavior that was not alleged to constitute unlawful discrimination or retaliation,” states the complaint. “In contrast with its harsh treatment of Poolos, CBS has declined to take any meaningful disciplinary action in response to serious allegations of misconduct against male employees.”\n\n\tIn the lawsuit, Poolos points to several current and former employees of the program whose alleged sexual misconduct and harassment went unaddressed by the network. She alleges that her ex-supervisor “emotionally abused and sexually harassed her for years” and that the network “discouraged [her] from raising complaints.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAmong the people that Poolos mentions is former CBS News president Neeraj Khemlani, who stepped down from his position in August overseeing flagship programs such as CBS Evening News and 60 Minutes. She claims he was the subject of numerous complaints for discrimination against women and employees of color but that the network “gave him multiple chances” to address his behavior instead of firing him.\n\n\t“Despite the many complaints about his abusive behavior from CBS employees, particularly women and people of color, Khemlani has faced no meaningful consequences for his abusive behavior and remains associated with CBS,” the complaint states.\n\n\tPoolos claims gender discrimination, retaliation and breach of contract. She seeks an order requiring CBS to adopt or strengthen antidiscrimination policies, as well as punitive damages.\n\n\tCBS declined to comment, citing a policy on pending litigation. \n\n\tNew York’s top prosecutor announced last year a $30.5 million settlement with CBS and Moonves for misleading the company’s investors about his misconduct and concealing sexual assault allegations against him. Moonves resigned in 2018 in the wake of public accusations by a group of women.\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nUnique expertise on how the law impacts Hollywood pros, projects and processes\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

And that’s affecting the quality of the work,\" the Interscope Records co-founder said.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tCarly Thomas\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nJimmy Iovine, the co-founder of Interscope Records and Beats by Dr. Dre, is sharing his thoughts on the music industry today and how he now feels “fame has replaced great.”\n\n\tDuring an interview with Consequence of Sound, published online Monday, the storied music executive and business mogul was asked about his thoughts on the use of artificial intelligence in songwriting and music production. AI has recently been at the center of debate across several industries, including entertainment.\n\n\n\n\t“I’m not saying it’s good or bad, but I think AI is going to be massive in songwriting on many levels,” he said in response. “One, on a very basic level, if somebody is stuck and you want to experiment and get an idea. Two, is that not everyone, but too many people today are making records for TikTok.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t98 Degrees Says Taylor Swift Inspired Them to Rerecord Their Masters\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Recording Academy Is On a Global Mission\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHe continued, “They used to make records for radio, but now it’s TikTok. That’s why all these pop records sound exactly the same. So if you’re making records like that, making records with this formula, then you’re going to start seeing big hits written and recorded with AI.”\n\n\tIovine was then quick to clarify that he specifically didn’t say “great” hits, but rather “big” hits, because he feels with modern technology such as streaming, AI and social media, “fame has replaced great.”\n\n\t“Artists are making so much money in so many different places, which is fantastic, but after they have a hit record, they can earn a lot of money on Instagram and all this stuff,” he said. “I feel that a lot of people, a lot of artists, not all, but a lot of artists are taking their foot off the gas in the record making category. And that’s affecting the quality of the work. And I think you’re seeing that in a lot of different genres right now.”\n\n\tThe conversation surrounding the creation of music and AI is nothing new, with artists and music executives on either side. Warner Music CEO Robert Kyncl has previously emphasized that “the thing that is important is: artists have a choice” when it comes to the use of AI.\n\n\tKyncl explained, “There are some that may not like it, and that’s totally fine. And then there are some that will embrace it. And that’s also fine.” \n\n\tAnother big debate is whether AI-created songs should be allowed to be considered for awards.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEarlier this year, in a wide-ranging interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Grammys CEO Harvey Mason Jr. confirmed that the Recording Academy “will not be awarding a Grammy to AI.” However, he noted that the Grammys will honor music that was created with AI elements, but that the majority of the song must be made by humans.\n\n\tMason Jr. added, “We will continue to honor humans and their participation or their portion of a creation, knowing full well that there could be AI parts.”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

Levy explained his four daughters are between the ages of 12 and 24, and the Grammy-winning artist has been “their only shared idol.” \n\n\n\n\t“When she asked me to be in the video for ‘All Too Well,’ and I was able to bring all four daughters to be in that video with me, I got dad cred for life,” Levy told People. The Stranger Things director pointed out that he had previously directed Sink and O’Brien and noted that All Too Well: The Short Film was one of the few times he had acted in 20 years. “It was a very fun day,” he added. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Swift Box Office: 'The Eras Tour' Heads for Record $150M-$200M Global Opening\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tGeneral News\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTravis Kelce's Mom Says NFL Is \"Laughing All the Way to the Bank\" After Taylor Swift Game Appearances\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThroughout his career, Levy explained he’s worked on projects that have correlated with his daughters’ ages. When they were younger, he worked on family comedies like Night at the Museum and Pink Panther; when they became teens, he started producing Stranger Things; and now his upcoming series All the Light We Cannot See is another age-appropriate thing for them to watch.\n\n\tOutside of work, Levy recently went to the Kansas City Chiefs-New York Jets game alongside Swift, Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Hugh Jackman and Sophie Turner. The match-up marked the second consecutive one Swift attended after being romantically linked to Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. \n\n\t“I have never witnessed and will likely never again witness anything like I saw when I went to the football game with Taylor Swift,” he told the publication. But he doesn’t mind. \n\n\t“As a dad of four girls, their collective fan-hood and mild obsession with Taylor is fine by me, because she’s a good role model,” Levy said. “And most importantly, that woman wrote all of those songs herself. This is a true generational creative genius.

Regularly $1,445, the Prime Big Deal Days offer gets you the Hollywood-loved exercise bike for $350 off (or a 24% discount). This is the best price for a Peloton that we’re seeing online, and the Amazon offer includes free shipping and free assembly.

Beloved by stars like Miley Cyrus and Hugh Jackman, and seen everywhere from social media to that scene in And Just Like That, the Peloton is one of the most popular home spin bikes. It also never goes on sale, so this Prime Day Peloton deal is something you’ll want to take advantage of.\n\n\tThe Peloton bike offers multiple ways to get in shape, combining cardio with strength and conditioning, with a multi-resistance knob and super smooth pedals to get your pump on. The 22-inch touchscreen features a clear and crisp display, while built-in speakers deliver 16 watts of loud, powerful music. You can also connect to the bike using Bluetooth or by plugging in your favorite pair of workout headphones. A 5MP camera lets the instructor see you when you join in on a class.\n\n\tSpeaking of classes, the Amazon deal gets you the Peloton bike on sale for $1,095 but you’ll need to pay for a Peloton subscription separately. An all-access membership runs about $44 a month and gets you unlimited access to both live and on-demand classes.

(Not yet a member of Amazon Prime? Unlock the Dr. Barbara Sturm deal by signing up for a 30-day free trial.)\n\n\t The brand already earned fans like Angela Bassett, Kim Kardashian, Blake Lively, Cher and other high-wattage stars, and Winfrey signed on as an investor in April.\n\n\n\t“Whenever I discover something delightful, I love to share it. I’ve been using Dr. Barbara Sturm products ever since they were introduced to my life four years ago,” Winfrey recently explained on Instagram. “I liked them so much — especially the treatments for darker skin tones — that I called [her] to tell her I wanted to invest in the company! My skin loves the Enzyme Cleanser for darker skin tones, followed by Glow Drops.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'The Color Purple': New Trailer Highlights Strength of Sisterhood\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSignal Awards: Oprah, Michelle Obama, Jon Stewart Among Winners of Podcast Honors (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSturm is renowned for her pioneering approach to addressing pollution damage and inflammation through skincare. The brand in May launched its Anti-Aging Body Scrub ($110), a two-in-one exfoliator that’s safe for sensitive skin and contains ubiquinone, vitamins E and F, purslane and sea fennel to slough away dead skin cells, support the regeneration of the skin barrier and healthy skin structure and protect against oxidative stress (a condition caused by lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, smoking and poor diet, among other activities). It contains nourishing and hydrating oils that soothe irritation, while plum kernel oil gives it a warm and sweet scent.\n\n\tThe Hollywood-loved facialist first became known for her “blood facial,” the treatment she created in 2002 that used clients’ own platelet-rich plasma — extracted from the blood and whipped into a custom moisturizer — to heal the skin. She launched her anti-inflammatory skincare line in 2014, and opened a spa and boutique in West Hollywood in 2020.\n\n\tSturm joined her starry new investor for a special Oprah Daily conversation about menopause, aging and more.\n\n\t“This year, one of my ideas is wholeness. I actually heard for the first time from Jane Fonda many years ago,” Winfrey said. “How do we learn how to make ourselves whole, and not strive for perfection but [instead] for that sense of all-around well-being. One step is to begin to be comfortable in your own skin, after all we spend our lives inside our skin. It’s the largest organ in our bodies, so taking care of our skin, nurturing it, protecting it, is so so important to living a whole and healthy life.”\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAmong her top tips, Sturm shared the importance of keeping “dewy, hydrated” skin, especially during menopause, why you should avoid spraying fragrance directly onto the skin and more.\n\n\t“Estrogen is going down [during menopause] but it’s also about the ratio of testosterone, progesterone and estrogen. Estrogen is the motor for collagen production. The pH changes, [it] goes a little higher and our skin needs an acidic pH so our skin barrier becomes compromised, so we get larger pores, sagging, wrinkles, thinner skin, problems with wound healing — all things we don’t like about our skin. Water leaves the skin a lot, it’s called transepidermal water loss, our skin barrier widens and our skin becomes extremely dry.”\n\n\tSturm also advised that perfume lovers spritz their scents onto their clothing rather than on the body. “When you spray your neck and you go into the sun, and you get pigmentation, this is from the alcohol in the fragrance which disrupts your skin barrier and the sun burns through,” she revealed.\n\n\tThe brand is available on Dr. Barbara Sturm’s website, Amazon Luxury Stores (where it’s currently 15 percent off), Nordstrom, Sephora and other high-end retailers.
