{"title": "What We Learned from Stephanie Grisham's Trump Tell-All, <i>I'll Take Your Questions Now</i>", "date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nIn her new book, Stephanie Grisham reveals a peek behind the scenes of the Trump White House, “where everything was like a clown car on fire running at full speed into a warehouse of fireworks.”\nAnother day, another Trumpworld memoir. The latest damning dispatch from the Trump Administration comes courtesy of Stephanie Grisham, who served various roles in the White House throughout a four-year period: communications director and press secretary in the West Wing, as well as communications director and chief of staff in Melania Trump’s East Wing. In I’ll Take Your Questions Now, her new memoir, Grisham depicts a White House “where everything was like a clown car on fire running at full speed into a warehouse of fireworks.” Caught between the president’s abusive leadership style and the conflicting loyalties she felt toward the first lady, Grisham’s final straw came on January 6, 2021, when she tendered her resignation hours into the insurrection at the Capitol. \nThe Trumps, for their part, have already moved to discredit Grisham. Describing Grisham as “very angry and bitter” after a break-up, President Trump said in a statement, “Stephanie didn’t have what it takes and that was obvious from the beginning. She had big problems and we felt that she should work out those problems for herself. Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.” Melania Trump also clapped back, saying in a statement, \"The author is desperately trying to rehabilitate her tarnished reputation by manipulating and distorting the truth about Mrs. Trump. Ms. Grisham is a deceitful and troubled individual who doesn’t deserve anyone’s trust.\"\nGrisham’s account, like any Trumpworld memoir, must be read with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, as Grisham herself admits, “Casual dishonesty filtered through the White House as though it were in the air conditioning system.” But Grisham anticipates that readers may not take her account at face value, writing, “This is not, by the way, a book where you need to like me.” We read I’ll Take Your Questions Now in advance of publication; now, we’re breaking down the biggest bombshells below.\nFirst up: Grisham offers insight into the daily routines of the first lady, and the derisive nickname they inspired:\nAccording to Grisham, there was no lost love between Melania Trump and her stepchildren, particularly Ivanka Trump:\nInappropriate behavior on the part of the Kushners earned the couple their own derisive nickname. “Because they dabbled in a bit of everything and could be precocious and self-absorbed, we in the East Wing dubbed [the Kushners] ‘the interns,’” Grisham writes. “Mrs. Trump was amused and herself used the nickname every now and then.” Tension between the East Wing and the Kushners is an enduring theme throughout the book, with Grisham continually emphasizing the conflicts of interest proposed by the Kushners’ role in the administration.  Take, for example, the matter of Jared Kushner’s security clearance:\nRemembering when Kushner teamed up with speechwriter Stephen Miller to write a televised address at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Grisham writes at length about what she saw as Kushner’s poisonous influence in the White House:\nBut the Kushners aren’t the only Trumpworld acolytes to come under fire in I’ll Take Your Questions Now. Grisham doesn’t mince words when writing about Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham:\nGrisham, like many other Trumpworld alums, takes note of Trump’s obsession with dictators. But it’s her recollection of 2019’s G20 Summit in Osaka that’s the most chilling, suggesting an all-too cozy rapport between Trump and Vladimir Putin:\nThe most interesting moments in I'll Take Your Questions Now come when Grisham offers a look behind the scenes of memorable moments. Take, for example, her recollections about the hand slap heard ‘round the world. In 2017, Melania Trump made headlines when she appeared to slap her husband’s hand away during a diplomatic visit to Saudi Arabia in 2017. The truth, according to Grisham, is less interesting:\nGrisham also delves into the Stormy Daniels scandal from 2018, remembering when Daniels sued Donald Trump over his efforts to suppress her disclosure of their affair. In the ensuing media blitz, Daniels likened Trump’s penis to a toadstool—a depiction he took such issue with that he called Grisham from Air Force One to set the record straight. \nRemember Trump's mysterious visit to Walter Reed Medical Center in 2019, when protocol was disrupted and doctors were asked to sign NDAs? Grisham takes us behind the scenes there, too. \nBut we know the real behind-the-scenes story you want to know about: behind the scenes of Trump's haircare routine. Grisham has got you covered:\nThat’s all for now, dear reader. We’ll see you next time there's a Trumpworld memoir to excavate, which surely won’t be long. \nAdrienne Westenfeld is the Books and Fiction Editor at Esquire, where she oversees books coverage, edits fiction, and curates the Esquire Book Club. \nIsrael-Palestine: How to Help the Victims of War\nAll the Celebrity Break Ups In 2023 (So Far)\nAll About Dalton Gomez, Ariana’s Ex-Husband\nA Timeline of Taylor and Travis’ Whirlwind Romance\nSarah Jessica Parker & Matthew Broderick Timeline\nA Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Love\nAll About Taylor Lautner's Wife Taylor Dome\nCiara and Russell Wilson's Relationship Timeline\nKhloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson's Romance\nRami Malek and Emma Corrin’s Relationship Timeline\nKendall Jenner Joins Bad Bunny in Miami\nLindsay Lohan Makes ‘Mean Girls’ Commercial\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "These 22 Designer Tote Bags Do It All With Style to Spare", "date": "2023-09-27 21:30:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe results are in: You deserve to treat yourself. \nHere at ELLE, we believe in tote bags—of any variety, really, but especially in designer tote bags. As modern-day working girlbosses women, we can only do it all and have it all if we quite literally “have it all” on hand. Any bag I purchase needs to serve as my work bag, gym, lunch, diaper, and shopping bag simultaneously. Translation: It has to have space. Totes are great for this, and to prove my point, I spoke with Blake Geffen, CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle, a designer bag rental service, to get a non-partisan take on which totes are really all that. \nAn avid tote user herself (she’s a mother of three),  Geffen confirms that a designer tote is a great investment option for anyone looking to start—or expand—a high-end collection. As for what to look for in a tote, durability is definitely key. “Both designer and non-designer bags should always be judged by the quality–from fabrics and construction to the stitching and zippers, buckles, etc.,” she says. “Our tote bags are constantly in motion, so it’s important that the one you’re using can endure your day-to-day comings and goings.” \nYou should also take lifestyle and occasion into consideration. Are you more into canvas totes or leather ones? “Compartments and zipper pockets are also qualities I’m always looking for, though may be less important to others. Depending on the setting, shoppers may also want to consider fabrics and strap styles...While the trend cycle shifts quickly, nothing is more fashionable than owning your own unique sense of style. So, choosing a handbag that’s true to you is by far the most important factor when looking for your next bag!”\nI took Geffen’s expertise, fellow ELLE editor recommendations, size, style, and features into account to bring you a list of the 22 best designer tote bags to shop now. \nThe gold chain isn’t just for aesthetics—it adjusts to make the strap however long as you’d like. And the ultra squishy handle is like a built-in stress ball.  \nColors: 6 options\nMaterial: Lambskin \nDimensions: Height: 9.4 inches; width: 11.4 inches; depth: 4.1 inches \nELLE readers love this Bottega Veneta Andiamo. Any bag that has been spotted on the likes of Michelle Yeoh, RM of BTS, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Jacob Elordi is an automatic thumbs up from me. \nColors: 7 options \nMaterial: Lambskin\nDimensions: Height: 7.9 inches; width: 9.8 inches; depth: 3.9 inches\n“I like to consider the medium Telfar Shopping Tote my ludicrously capacious bag,” says beauty commerce editor Nerisha Penrose. “The beauty (and versatility) of Telfar’s popular Shopping Tote is that it can be whatever the hell you want it to be...It houses all 12 of my nude lip glosses, my Macbook, a Tupperware packed with a home-cooked meal, and a collection of ketchup packets (who loves dry fries, anyway?).”\nColors: 40 options \nMaterial: Polyurethane, polyester  \nDimensions: Height: 11.25 inches; width: 15 inches; depth: 5 inches\nThis next recommendation comes from ELLE’s own digital deputy editor Claire Stern. “This perfectly sized carryall by one of my favorite Scandi brands, Little Liffner, has fast become my new go-to. It’s sleek and minimalist enough for after-work commitments and perfectly practical for daytime.”\nColors: 7 options \nMaterial: Cow suede, cotton \nDimensions: Height: 7.8 inches; width: 7 inches; depth: 7 inches\nWhat’s better than one iconic Tory Burch bag? A doubled version. \nColors: Pine Bark \nMaterial: Leather, suede, cotton \nDimensions: Height: 11.8 inches; width: 12.4 inches; depth: 6.1 inches\nLike the love child of your favorite tote and your favorite vase. There’s certainly something to be said about self-supporting bags. \nColors: Mushroom or Black \nMaterial: Cow leather, Polyurethane\nDimensions: Height: 23.5 inches; width: 16.3 inches; depth: 7.4 inches\nGet ready to see big bows—a lot of them. I predict they’ll be popping up on designer clothes and accessories everywhere next season.\nColors: Boss Suede, Black Leather, Ecru Suede, or Light Denim \nMaterial: Calf leather (varies by style) \nDimensions: Height: 29 inches; width: 17 inches; depth: 6 inches\nOld Celines will never go out of style. I borrowed one to use during fashion month and was amazed at how spacious and practical it was. Would recommend. \nColors: Neutral \nMaterial: Cowhide leather \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 12.25 inches; depth: 6.75 inches\nThis otherwise standard black tote is spiced up a bit by the oversized gold buckle on the strap. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather, faux suede \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 11.75 inches; depth: 5.25 inches\nDoesn’t this A.L.C. bag look pillowy soft? \nColors: Burnt Umber \nMaterial: Faux leather \nDimensions: Height: 15.75 inches; width: 15.75 inches; depth: 4.75 inches\nWhat? I’ve got nothing to hide. Flaunt your belongings in a sexy mesh bag. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Mesh, patent leather \nDimensions: Height: 21.5 inches; width: 14 inches\nSlouchy bags, embellishments, and metallics are three trends that I saw a ton of this fashion month. \nColors: 6 options \nMaterial: Calf leather, silver plated brass (varies by style) \nDimensions: Height: 20 inches; width: 20.5 inches; depth: 13 inches\nIt’s always nice when totes have multiple handles or adjustable straps. Rock this one on your shoulder, the crook of your elbow, or in your hand. \nColors: Salmon Pink \nMaterial: Faux leather, twill \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 18 inches; depth: 6.25 inches\nQuilted bags are having a moment, and I can’t stop thinking about this Prada rendition, which comes in various sizes.  \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 10.6 inches; width: 12.2 inches; depth: 5.1 inches\nGeffen cites the Neverfull as one of the most popular designer tote styles at Vivrelle. With a name like Neverfull, it’s no surprise.  \nColors: Brown Monogram\nMaterial: Cowhide leather \nDimensions: Height: 11.4 inches; width: 12.6 inches; depth: 6.7 inches\nThis is yet another customer favorite. Whether you actually fill it with books is up to you, but it is in the name.... \nColors: Ecru and Pink Toile de Jouy Embroidery \nDimensions: Height: 11 inches; width: 14 inches; depth: 6.5 inches \nBoth Geffen and Stern love this bag from Saint Laurent. “It may not be great for my back, but this tote bag holds my MacBook Air perfectly and has a pouch for miscellaneous belongings (keys, phone, AirPods),” Stern says. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 16 inches; width: 13 inches; depth: 5 inches  \nSwap your tired old work bag for this party-ready option from Rabanne that looks straight out of Studio 54 (or the Renaissance tour). \nColor: Silver \nMaterial: Mesh aluminum, leather \nDimensions: Height: 39 inches; width: 34 inches; depth: 2 inches \nFrom the front, this might look like your average tote. But from the side, it’s got room in spades. If you’re looking for a wearable storage unit, this is the one for you. \nColors: Black, Mushroom, or Burgundy \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 15 inches; width: 21 inches; depth: 9 inches \nThis is 2023’s high fashion version of a Mary Poppins bag. \nColors: Brown \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 14.6 inches; width: 22 inches; depth: 5.9 inches \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "Stop Hurting Your Shoulders and Switch to These Backpacks", "date": "2023-09-28 15:45:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n“On the fence? Don’t be. You need this. Just BUY IT.”\nEveryone knows I love backpacks. It’s a moot point by now. I would stop talking about it if I could, but now I’ve turned myself into an expert, so if you’re wondering about the best backpacks for women, I’m your girl. \nFor postural, sartorial, and practical reasons, a backpack is the way to go. Emphasis on postural. A leather tote is appealing, but a beautiful posture is hard to beat. Whether you plan to use it as a work bag, laptop bag, carry-on backpack or gym bag, there’s no limit to how you can make the most of a new option. \nI scouted out which backpacks on the market have both the style and function you need and also tapped my fellow editors for their personal recommendations to bring you this list of the 16 best backpacks for women. See them all below.\nWhen shopping for a backpack, you often have to make a choice to go with a non-designer one that focuses on function or a fashionable one that might lack practicality. I love that Vivienne Westwood collaborated with bag brand Eastpak to bring you the best of both worlds.  \nColors: Planet Print \nMaterial: Recycled polyester \nDimensions: Height: 15.35 inches; width: 14.57 inches; depth: 7.87 inches  \nLunch packers, I admire you deeply. Senior editor Alyssa Bailey recommends this style. “I walk to work and am regularly going to events for my job,” she says. “I needed a bag that could fit my laptop, a salad, and sometimes a change of shoes while looking fashionable. This one is it! Comfy, roomy but amazingly compact, Modern Picnic’s backpack has shown me I don’t have to give up style to have an actually good work backpack.”\nColors: Black, Cream, Black Croc \nMaterial: Vegan leather \nDimensions: Height: 14.25 inches x width: 11.5 inches x depth: 6 inches\nI know of at least three people at ELLE who use this bag—myself included. “Some bags seem to weigh even more than my laptop does, but this MZ Wallace backpack is feather light,” says Sara Austin, executive editor.  “I also appreciate the luggage sleeve that slips easily over my carry-on handle when I’m traveling.”\nColors: Black, Dahlia Camo, Dawn, Magnet, Silver Blue \nMaterials: Sustainable textile, leather trim \nDimensions: Height: 16.5 inches x width: 12.2 inches x depth: 6.9 inches\nWhether you’re hitting Fright Night at Six Flags, Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS tour, or you’re just into the transparent bag trend, this one’s for you. \nColors: 8 options \nMaterial: PVC \nDimensions: Height: 12 inches; width: 11 inches; depth: 6 inches \nCustomer review: “Good bag. I bought it for a football game but ended up using it for work or running errands. Good size. Not too big or too small. I spilled mac and cheese it the other day and it wiped out super easy.”\n“As a firm believer in backpacks for work, this Calpak bag is the one I get complimented on the most,” ELLE social media editor Carine Lavache tells me. “It’s chic, comes in a variety of colors, and has plenty of pockets to keep your things organized.”\nColors: 21 options \nMaterial: Faux leather, polyester \nDimensions: Height: 15.5 inches x width: 11.5 inches x depth: 4.5 inches\nA classic fail-safe. These packs last forever and seem to match any outfit, which makes them great for dressing up or down. \nColors: 27 options \nMaterial: Vinylon \nDimensions: Height: 14.5 inches; width: 10.25 inches; depth: inches \nCustomer review: “I got this to use on our family vacation, and I was so happy I did. It is lightweight and fits all I need for a day on the go with my family. The only thing that I would change would be larger water bottle pockets.”\nThis bag is ultra functional and very affordable while maintaining a sleek, versatile style. It’s also available in a 17.3-inch size. \nColors: 6 options\nMaterial: N/A \nDimensions: Height: 17.3 inches; width: 11.4 inches; depth: 6.1 inches \nCustomer review: “I searched high and low, expensive and cheap and this bag is almost perfect!”\nThis backpack comes with a pacifier pouch, smell-proof bag for soiled clothes, a portable changing pad, AND a silicone teething ring. But even still, many reviewers say they don’t even use this as a diaper bag. It’s just an all-around good bag. \nColors: Grey, Black, Navy \nMaterial: Nylon twill, vegan leather \nDimensions: Height: 15 inches; width: 12 inches; depth: 7.7 inches \nCustomer review: “On the fence? Don’t be. You need this. Just BUY IT....I truly do 100% recommend this!”\nYou can’t go wrong with Dagne Dover. Every item I’ve tried has been super high quality, and customers love that this backpack comes in various sizes.  \nColors: 6 options\nMaterial: Neoprene, REPREVE \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 9.5 inches; depth: 5 inches (for small size) \nCustomer review: “Great backpack! Comfortable and has a lot of space and useful pockets/features. I use it for school, work, and traveling, and it’s great for all of these functions. It’s also stylish and really soft.”\nThe bottom of this backpack is a cooler, making it perfect for packing summit beers on your next hike or hard seltzers on your next trip to the beach. Or, you know, your packed lunch on a daily basis. \nColors: Grey, Brown, Black \nMaterial: Polyester \nDimensions: Height: 17.8 inches; width: 12.5 inches; depth: 8 inches \nCustomer review: “When I received it, I liked it so much I had to get one for my husband as well! The insulated bottom is huge! My husband packs two one-liter water bottles, snacks, his lunch and an energy drink/pop daily. The top backpack part is a little smaller since it has the cooler on the bottom, but still holds so much. The bag is incredibly durable and lightweight also.”\nIf you don’t need a high capacity bag that can house your laptop and other bulky items, this smaller sling is a great style. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather, cotton \nDimensions: N/A\nCustomer review: “Love the size! Strap is adjustable which is great since I’m short:) Beautiful leather too!

{"title": "21 Best Lingerie Brands to Take a Spot in Your Top Drawer", "date": "2023-09-28 17:19:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nLust-worthy designs for any type of lifestyle.\nLingerie brands have come a long way since the days of ultra-push-up bras and bows on panties. Not to say those can’t be fun, but there’s so much more nuance to what can be sexy these days (and thank God—and Rihanna—for that). From ultra-sexy to minimalistic to just pure fun, there’s a lingerie style out there for every woman, and for every version of you that you want to be. Some days you want to be bright and bold, and others, you’d rather throw on something sleek and classic. No one feels the same every day, and whether someone sees it or not, what you wear under your clothes should reflect how you feel.\nWhether you’re wearing lingerie for yourself or as a special surprise, out on the town or lounging at home, you’ll want to feel comfortable and confident. That’s where these brands come in. Not only will they make you feel great, but you’ll look great too (priority #1 and priority #2). Underwear can be worn as outerwear now, too, so if you’re trying to get in on the sheer trend that we’ve been seeing all over the runways, you’ll want to check these out too.

{"title": "23 Best Candle Gift Sets to Start ﻿Your Collection", "date": "2023-09-28 19:07:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAn aroma for every mood. \nThere are candle lovers, and then there’s me—a candle collector, hoarder, and obsessive. Like flowers and candies, candle gift sets have always been the go-to for lazy, last-minute shoppers whenever popular holidays or birthdays roll around. You can't just buy any candle you see , no matter how gorgeous the packaging—candles can be very deceiving. \nReceiving a candle as a gift can sometimes elicit eye rolls and scoffs, especially when you’re unsure what brands provide the best throw (how strong and far a particular candle's aroma can spread) or what notes the receiver favors. As a self-professed candle connoisseur, I’m here to lend a helping hand. I'm not ashamed to admit I house a treasure trove of candles in a closet—from mini to jumbo and everything in between—that span every budget and mood, collected over the years. From designer faves like Diptyque and Le Labo to Nest and Forvr Mood's fan-favorite scents, here are the 23 absolute best candle gift sets that will make you everyone’s favorite gift-giver. \nScent notes: (Gris) floral, woods; (30 Montaigne) spicy, oriental\nWhat’s included: Gris Dior full size and travel size, scented bar soap, body cream, candle snuffer, candle\nIf your palette leans spicy some days, lean into Dior’s Gris gift set, which comes with a full-sized and travel-sized Gris Dior fragrance, soap, body cream, snuffer, and the 30 Montaigne scented candle. \nScent notes: (Cookie Coma) almond, brown sugar, cinnamon, Tahitian vanilla; (To Live & Pine) Tangerine, winterberry, sparkling mint, musk; (Sneaky Link) grapefruit, lime, apple; (Cabin Fever) fig, peach, mango, tart lemon, vanilla\nWhat’s included: (4) candles\nForvr Mood candles have a throw that fills up any space before you even light the candle.

{"title": "15 Best Drugstore Retinol Products That Are Just as Effective as Expensive Ones", "date": "2023-09-29 14:35:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAsk anyone you know: The best part about visiting your local drugstore is the versatility of snagging your everyday essentials, preventative medicine, and beauty staples in a swipe. Our introduction to beauty likely began in the sprawling aisles of our drugstores, from affordable cleansers and moisturizers to mascaras and eyeliners—if you need it, the drugstore likely has it. This also includes retinol—a topical ingredient used to increase skin rejuvenation and address texture, among other issues—that was traditionally prescribed by dermatologists but is now offered over the counter at drugstores for a fraction of the price, in formulas that treat the body and skin. “Retinol is a vitamin A derivative that regulates skin cell turnover, helping to address skin tone and texture. It works to help unclog the pores, prevent breakouts, and improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation and discoloration while also helping to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” says Dr. Marisa Garshick, board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Cornell New York Presbyterian Medical Center. \nChances are you’ve seen a few drugstore retinol products but had doubts about their effectiveness and cost. Allow these 15 best drugstore retinol products to change your mind. We polled several dermatologists and online customer feedback to find the best drugstore retinol formulas money can buy. Your skin (and wallet) will thank you. \nThere’s no need to second guess if you're using too little or too much retinol each week. With RoC's retinol capsules, you’ll give your skin the right amount every time. Each capsule has retinol and antioxidants to address fine lines and wrinkles.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, antioxidants\nSize: 30 capsules\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nOur expert says: “These retinol capsules also contain antioxidants and ceramides, so they help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles without irritating the skin. The capsule design makes them especially good for on the go.”—Dr. Marisa Garshick, \nIf you prefer a multipurpose product, Netrogena’s Regenerating Cream uses retinol to reverse signs of aging and hyaluronic acid to hydrate and plump the skin to avoid irritation. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid\nSize: 1.7 fl oz\nUlta rating: 4.3 fl oz \nOur expert says: “This is a great retinol option, especially for beginners, as not only does it provide retinol benefits but it also contains hyaluronic acid to help boost moisture, improving overall tolerability.”—Dr. Garshick\nMaintenance and prevention are vital when it comes to fighting acne scars. The Differin Gel helps to do both by penetrating the pores to reduce breakouts and diminishing the appearance of existing scars. \nKey ingredients: Adapalene \nSize: 0.5 fl oz \nAmazon rating: 4.5 fl oz\nOur expert says: “Containing adapalene, a prescription retinoid now available over-the-counter, this [gel] can be a great option for someone dealing with breakouts and blemishes.  By helping to regulate skin cell turnover, it helps to prevent clogged pores and is especially good for those with oily skin,” says Dr. Garshick. Fellow dermatologist Dr. Brendan Camp is also a fan of the over-the-counter gel. “The active ingredient in Differin is adapalene, which is a retinoid. It used to be available only by prescription but is now available over the counter. Primarily marketed as an acne treatment, products with adapalene can address concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots,” he says. \nAnother RoC drugstore gem, this formula was designed to improve the lines and wrinkles that emerge under your eye, as well as dark circles that may form over time.  \nKey ingredients: Retinol, minerals\nSize: 0.5 fl oz\nOur expert says: “This retinol eye cream is gentle enough to use on the skin around the eyes and helps tackle concerns like crow’s feet, dark circles, and puffiness.”—Dr. Brendan Camp \nTry this Olay hydrating, retinol-infused body wash if you’re troubled with bacne. In addition to retinol, Olay’s Nighttime Body Wash is formulated with vitamin B3 to refresh and renew your skin so it's left feeling soft and supple. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, vitamin B3\nSize: 20 fl oz  \nTarget rating: 4.6/5 stars\nOur expert says: “I'll admit it: TikTok made me do it. As someone who constantly breaks out on my chest and back, I was desperate for a formula that would clear my body acne fast. Olay’s retinol body wash not only helped to reduce my breakouts, but I believe its hydrating formula is the reason so many people have complimented me on how soft and clear my skin looks.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor  \nIf you’re a beginner looking for an affordable entry to retinol, drugstore favorite CeraVe has you covered. Along with encapsulated retinol to brighten and improve texture, this serum also has hyaluronic acid and ceramides, so you’re not left with an irritated, damaged skin barrier.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid, ceramides\nSize: 1 fl oz\nOur expert says: “This retinol serum is formulated as an encapsulated retinol to reduce the appearance of fine lines and dullness. It also incorporates niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides to strengthen the skin barrier and deliver all-day hydration as it is formulated with MVE technology,” says Dr. Garshick. Dr. Brendan Camp loves this serum for its hydrating properties. “Made with hyaluronic acid to boost hydration, niacinamide to calm skin, and ceramides to improve moisture, this retinol serum helps address premature signs of aging,” he adds. \nAs the name suggests, Versed Press Restart helps give your skin a second (or third, or fourth?) chance at renewal. Using bakuchiol, a retinol alternative, this serum smooths texture; chlorophyll is also in its make-up to enrich the skin with a boost of oxygen. \nKey ingredients: Bakuchiol, chlorophyll \nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “It is helpful in smoothing out rough patches, as I’m in my mid seventies and have some skin issues.” \nThe antidote for a lifted, smoothed, soft face is found in this bottle. L’Oréal Paris’ Pure Retinol Night Serum works to gradually erase those pesky fine lines and wrinkles so you can maintain a more youthful appearance. \nKey ingredient: Retinol\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This is hands down the best retinol I’ve ever used! My skin is much more smooth and glowing! I keep a very simple routine and this is my magic serum! I recommend this always for OTC retinol.”\nSmall but mighty, this concentrate primarily focuses on refining the look of pores and delaying any signs of aging with a formula that fuses retinol with peptides for extra cushion.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, peptides\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nOur expert says: “This retinol treatment is formulated with a retinol optimizer encapsulation system to enhance medication delivery and optimize effects.”—Dr. Brendan Camp\nHow can one treatment target so many common skin care woes? The La Roche-Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel attacks breakouts—the main culprit of dark spots and deep scarring—head-on by helping unclog pores and prevent new acne.\nKey ingredient: Adapalene \nSize: 1.6 fl oz \nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Honestly this product is great and has helped cleared my acne scars so much and I barely break out, this is one of my favorites and I definitely recommend getting it!!”\nAs you catch your Zzz, this gentle serum soothes and smoothes the skin to reveal a brighter, youthful-looking appearance over time.\nKey ingredients: Retinyl linoleate, hyaluronic acid \nSize: 1 fl oz\nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I’m consistently surprised at how much better my skin looks the morning after I use this serum. I also love the consistency and how nicely it soaks up into your skin without leaving it feeling sticky/tacky. You’re able to apply other serums/moisturizer over it without that annoying “pilling” of product. I’m struggling with hormonal acne as I turn 30 and this stuff is the only thing that keeps it at bay. There is an instant improvement overnight, every single time. As with all retinols, this will cause some irritation when not introduced to your skin slowly. But it is completely worth it for the results you get.”\nWhen using retinol, the key to protecting your skin is to sandwich it with a hydrating moisturizer as a protective barrier. Good thing Eucerin did the hard work for you. The anti-wrinkle cream gradually fades wrinkles with pro-retinol and nourishes the skin with vitamin E and macadamia nut oil. \nKey ingredients: Pro-retinol, vitamin E, macadamia nut oil\nSize: 1.7 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve used this, along with other Eucerin skin products, for several years. After removing makeup at night and cleaning my face, applying this cream is my gift to my face. It has a pleasant scent and a rich texture. The cream easily absorbs into my face and neck, where it can work its magic all night long. Reasonably priced, there’s no excuse for not using this anti-wrinkle cream.\nYou can’t talk about staple drugstore skin care without mentioning Olay. The Regenerist Retinol24 Night Moisturizer is the superhero your routine has been missing; its powers include brightening, lifting, and firming, in addition to wrinkle and pore reduction.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, vitamin B3\nSize: 1.7 fl oz \nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars\nOur expert says: “Olay Regenerist Retinol24 Night Moisturizer is my favorite drugstore brand retinol for many reasons. It contains a blend of their proprietary retinoid complex, niacinamide, and amino peptides that help revive and rejuvenate the skin. It penetrates deep into the skin surface to address many concerns, including fine lines and wrinkles, smoothness, brightness, firming, dark spots, and pores. It also hydrates the skin and helps to maintain the natural skin barrier.”—Dr. Lauren Penzi\nYou can always count on E.L.F for your makeup needs, but the brand also has your skin care covered. Featuring a blend of retinol, antioxidants, and hyaluronic acid, this serum plumps and hydrates the skin while improving texture. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid \nSize: 2.15 fl oz \nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “The serum has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that glides smoothly onto the skin. I appreciate that it doesn’t leave a sticky residue or cause any discomfort upon application. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a plus for those with sensitive skin. I’ve been using the e.l.f. SKIN Youth Boosting Advanced Night Retinoid Serum for about eight weeks now, and I’ve noticed some positive changes in my skin. My complexion appears smoother, and fine lines around my eyes and mouth have become less noticeable. I did experience some mild peeling and sensitivity during the first two weeks, but it subsided as my skin adjusted to the retinoid.”\nWrinkles, scars, and crepey skin don’t only appear on the face—the body gets its fair share, too. Thanks to this firming cream from Advanced Clinicals, your body can be as smooth and blemish-free as your face. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, ferulic acid, green tea, aloe vera \nSize: 16 fl oz \nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I was skeptical at first but after using this product I have to admit it works. I have extremely dry skin on my legs and after using the lotion for less than a week my skin looks so much better. You’d never know there was a problem. I definitely recommend it for others.”\nWhile drugstore retinol products may have great benefits, Dr. Marisa Garshick says not all formulas are made equally. \n“Retinol may exist in different concentrations, which may impact both efficacy and tolerability. However, some retinols may also be combined with other ingredients to help maximize benefits and enhance tolerability. Additionally, prescription retinoids tend to be more effective than over-the-counter retinols, but ultimately it comes down to tolerability,” she explains. If over-the-counter products aren’t yielding the results you desire, Dr. Garshick advises visiting a dermatologist for a more effective treatment plan. \n“When considering a drugstore retinol, it is important to not only look for a brand and product that is backed by clinical studies, but also to consider the type of retinol, the concentration and any other ingredients in the formulation, such as ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid to help minimize irritation,” Dr. Garshick offers. \nDr. Marisa Garshick is a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Cornell New York Presbyterian Medical Center. \nDr. Brendan Camp is a double board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery.\nDr. Lauren Penzi is a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery.\nNerisha is the beauty commerce editor at ELLE.com, covering all things beauty (and fashion and music).

{"title": "The 16 Best Diffusers for Curly Hair", "date": "2023-09-29 15:13:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nHello, volume.\nIf you have thick, curly hair, you probably already know that you need one of the best diffusers for curly hair in your routine. Because if you’ve ever tried air drying your curls, you already know that it can take forever and leave a lot to be desired as far as the finished result. Think: lack of definition, bounce, and less volume. If you want to achieve a bouncy blowout–big, ’90s hair is back–or accentuate your natural texture without all the frizz, the best diffusers for curly hair can make a big difference. \n“A blow dryer diffuser directs the airflow, so it does not disturb the curl pattern,” explains Todd Faul, senior cosmetology educator at Aveda Arts & Sciences Institutes-Dallas. “Diffusers can be used on hair that has been permed to enhance the curl, or on naturally curly hair to enhance your God-given curls.” \nAs you begin your journey to find your diffuser match, it isn’t always as simple as picking up the most affordable or prettiest option. Not every diffuser will fit every hair dryer, so that’s something to look out for. If you’re not crazy about your current hair dryer, now may be the time to purchase a dryer and diffuser combo so that you know that they’re compatible. It’s also key to have your goals in mind. Looking for extra volume? More definition? Those factors can help guide you toward the right diffuser. \nWe tapped top hair stylists for their favorite diffusers, scoured customer reviews, and included a few options we’ve tested and love to find the best diffusers on the market. Whatever your curl wishes are, here are the 16 best diffusers for curly hair that really wowed us.\nIf you want to add volume but keep definition, this diffuser is gentle enough to do both. The hand-like tool gently cups hair, instead of disturbing it, so you can get the best of both worlds. Want to see if it will fit your hairdryer? See specs and measurements here. \nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I love, love, love, LOVE this diffuser! The fingers slip into areas of my hair around my head in ways that a traditional diffuser cannot. For example, I can slide it *into* the curls instead of just scrunching them. It gives me great lift at the roots.”\nFor curls that look just as good as what you can get in a salon, try the GHD diffuser attachment. It makes quick work of even long, thick curls, without using too much heat. This diffuser can be used with the GHD Helios dryer, or their Air Professional dryer.\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “As a hairstylist, I ordered this diffuser for the purpose of working with naturally curly hair. This nozzle fit perfectly on my blow dryer and stays put until I detach it. It is strong and sturdy so it will last for many years to come.”\nIf you’re searching for a new tool that does it all, consider this one. This hair dryer comes with a diffuser, a smoothing attachment, and even some hair clips to make the process easy. Many Amazon reviewers noted its reasonable price, but decent blow drying and diffusing skills that stand up to more expensive competitors.\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I really like the Revlon Drying Power blower in white, and the color is simply gorgeous. It comes with both an acrylic or plastic nozzle and a diffuser, which is a great plus. I also appreciate the hair clips and cooling button included. Another positive is that it’s not heavy to hold, and the heat it provides is just right for my hair drying needs.”\nIf you’re lucky enough to have long, curly hair, then you know that drying those curls can take a ton of time. This diffuser paired with the T3 AireLuxe dryer can quickly dry a ton of hair without leaving behind any damp spots. The T3 dryer is one of our favorites because it dries hair quickly, and adding this diffuser is chef’s kiss for enhancing any wave pattern.\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn expert reviewer says: “I absolutely swear by my T3 blow dryer, in part because it means I can use this diffuser. I swear this cuts my drying time in half, and my curls always come out defined and voluminous.” –Tatjana Freund \n“The best diffuser for adding volume, and the most economical, is the Conair Infiniti pro,” says cosmetology educator Todd Faul. “It is lightweight with lots of power and works great to enhance your curls with the diffuser attachment.” It touts ceramic technology for faster drying and less damage, plus the set comes with another attachment for creating sleek blowouts as.\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have had the orange version for about 16 years and it’s still going strong! I bought a second one in burgundy for my vacation house. Works just as great. I have curly hair and use the diffuser daily. My curls are beautiful and bouncy and it doesn’t dry my hair out.”\nIf you’re looking for a diffuser that's no muss, no fuss, then look no further. This diffuser is made of heat-resistant silicone, and it can fold down, making it easy to store and travel with. Plus, the silicone barrel fits on almost every hair dryer, so you don’t need to buy a new one. If you don’t use a diffuser often, rest assured this is a great purchase as it doesn’t take up too much room.\nRevolve rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn expert reviewer says: “When I travel, trying to decide which hair products to bring is always the hardest part of packing. For my curls, a diffuser is absolutely essential, but most are so bulky. I love that this tool collapses so I can easily pack it use it with hotel hair dryers.” –Tatjana Freund, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor\nIf you’re trying to speed up the drying process, opt for a diffuser like this one. It has 360-degree airflow, meaning your hair will dry evenly. It’s also very large, so you can scoop up a big bundle of curls and dry them super fast. Note: This diffuser doesn’t fit all hair dryers! It has a 1.8-inch nozzle diameter, so it will only fit dryers that have the same measurement.\nAmazon rating: 4.3/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have long, very thick hair, and I can’t believe how much hair I can get inside this thing!! Wish I would have gotten this a long time ago!”\nLooking to invest in your haircare? Dyson is considered one of the leaders in hair tools, and their Supersonic Dryer is worth the hefty price tag. Not only does it come with a magnetic diffuser (this tiny detail is a game changer–it makes each attachment feel super sturdy when it’s on), but it comes with a comb attachment, concentrated nozzle for straightening, a flyaway tool, and more. \nSephora rating: 4/5 stars\nAn expert reviewer says: “At first, I thought that the dryer was too powerful, but once I learned how to use it, there was no going back. And all of the attachments are so fun to play around with and really work. I find that the best combo for a smooth, yet bouncy curl look is to use the diffuser on the lengths of towel-dried hair and then the smoothing nozzle on top to minimize frizziness and flyaways.”—Lisa DeSantis, ELLE.com contributor \nIf you’re packing your bags to go on vacay, don’t stress if your hairdryer can’t fit. This collapsible diffuser fits on almost every hair dryer on the market, including those dryers that hotels have, so you can keep styling on the go.\nRizoz Curls rating: 4.7/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “With the help of this diffuser, my curls look amazing!”\nLooking for a hair dryer that meets all of your curls’ wishes? This baby packs a punch with anti-frizz technology, three heat settings and a cold shot, and a huge diffuser head. If you’re looking for shiny, healthy curls that are defined with tons of volume, look no further. \nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I’ve always had an issue with frizz, and this diffuser one million percent removed 99 percent of it! Highly recommend to any one who’s trying to love their curls cause I know it’s a lot of work. Curl Smith Diffuser will change your life! I have low-med porosity hair, mainly 3B curl pattern.”\nFrom Tracee Ellis Ross’ curl-specific brand, this blow dryer took two years to get right and features four attachments including a diffuser that offers much more than meets the eye. Its prongs are spaced out to provide proper ventilation to heat curls evenly for shaping and setting. For a customized blowout that’s tailor-made to your unique curls, there are three heat and two speed settings to choose from. You can read ELLE’s full review of Pattern for more information.\nUlta rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn expert reviewer says: “I love that Pattern’s heat system has an attachment for all, well, hair patterns and textures.” –Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com Beauty Commerce Editor\n Whether you’re traveling, sharing a hair dryer, or simply on a budget, this fabric diffuser can be tightened onto your classic blow dryer to create a diffusing effect. “The sock diffuser will fit on pretty much all hair dryers,” says Faul. “Made from a lightweight, heat-resistant fabric instead of plastic like most diffusers, it’s perfect for people that travel as it is easy to pack in your suitcase and will fit on any hair dryer that is provided by the hotel that you’re staying at.”\nAmazon rating: 3.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “This little diffuser is perfect. The picture doesn’t show the elastic strap that holds it to the dryer, but it does have one. My other diffusers leave me with lots of frizz or constantly pop off the dryer during use. I now keep this one permanently attached to my dryer. I have lots of curly 3A hair and this product dries it without frizz and lots of shine. A truly great product for curly hair!”\nSearching for a bit more bounce? That’s what the Drybar diffuser is best at. It helps lift curls off the scalp, giving you tons of volume without adding frizz. Plus, while this diffuser works with Drybar’s hair dryers, it also fits most other blow dryers, too! The proof is in the pudding.\nUlta rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “My hair dryer worked fine, but I needed a diffuser attachment. This one fits my Rusk CTC hair dryer perfectly, and it actually dries my hair faster than the one that came with my blow dryer. I’d recommend!”\nThis tool was created to help accentuate your natural texture. It’s great for people with wavy hair who are looking to keep a natural bend in their hair. This dryer and diffuser are super lightweight, which means your styling routine can stop being your workout routine, too.\nAmazon rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “The best method for my own head of curls is to wash it as normal, put a small amount of leave-in conditioner on my hair to maintain moisture, and finger twist with Mop Top custard. After finger-twisting, I just gently diffuse with this dryer upside down first, then left and right before finally upright, until hair is dry.”\nThis brand has taken notes and created the diffuser of our dreams. Not only does this fit almost every hair dryer on the market thanks to some clever design, but it also has a huge barrel, so even people with the thickest hair can style and dry their hair quickly.\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I love that this diffuser is adjustable to fit on many hair blowers. It works well and I’ve had no issues with anything melting or overheating.”\nWhether you’re looking to rock your natural texture or give yourself a sleek blowout, this hair dryer and attachments can make all your hair dreams come true. With a diffuser, smoothing attachment, and comb attachment, you’ll never need to step foot in a salon again.\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\n An Amazon reviewer says:“No frills, but it had everything I needed with the cool setting being perfect and the absolute best part was how crazy lightweight it is!”\n “Diffusers essentially diffuse the air coming out of the dryer, so it reduces the velocity and spreads it out further, which is great for mimicking air-drying,” says David Lopez, New York-based celebrity hairstylist and curl expert. While a traditional blow dryer pushes air out and causes frizz, a diffuser will just gently dry hair without any friction. \n“I would say anyone who wants to mimic air-drying, or perhaps encourage some volume in their natural waves or curls, and of course, someone with curly hair,” says Lopez. Diffusers are great for anyone who wants to add a bit more volume to their styles as well. “Even people with straight hair can use a diffuser,” adds Faul. “They will be surprised to see how much body and wave they can get out of diffusing their hair.”\n“First, I just really rotate the diffuser around the head and around the hair, without touching or manipulating the hair at all until a cast starts to form from the product that you use,” says Lopez. “Then, once a cast starts to form and you want to start building volume, you can tilt your head side-to-side or flip upside down gently and then encourage some volume and some more curl.”\n“Wait until your hair is completely dry before you start cupping it to encourage the curl,” says Lopez. “The more you touch your hair while it’s drying, the more you are going to encourage frizz. So, I always tell people to let the hair dry first to at least 85 to 90 percent, basically almost completely dry, before you start cupping it and encouraging volume, so you don’t have as much frizz.”\nTatjana Freund is Hearst's Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor, covering beauty, fashion and more across multiple brands.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nBack to school, back to reality, back to fall fashion! \nWe can’t help but think of fall as September rolls around. The energy is fresh, fashion month is upon us, and with that, a slew of new fashion drops, collaborations, and special moments that you won’t want to miss, like John Hardy’s reimagined New York store, Swarovski’s latest assortment of lab-grown diamonds, and more. Keep checking back for all the latest and greatest in fashion news. \nWho: John Hardy\nWhat: Reimagined New York store\nWhere: 118 Prince Street, New York City\nWhy: John Hardy’s new direction under Reed Krakoff is positively refreshing, with a bold new take on the classic woven pieces fans of the brand know and love. To commemorate this change, the Soho store has been renovated and given a breath of new life, with a bold marigold and yellow color palette and Balinese artwork. The two new collections, Spear and Surf, are available to purchase, plus a tea bar in the back for when you need a quick refresher. “I wanted to honor the essence of John Hardy’s foundational designs, fusing the brand’s rich Balinese heritage with a contemporary vision,” Krakoff exclusively tells ELLE.com. “The reimagination of our flagship store was conceived through the same perspective. Our goal was to create an immersive environment that offers our clients the best of the new brand vision as well as the enduring legacy of craftsmanship that has always defined our brand.” \nWho: Luar and Emcee\nWhat: Ana bag collection\nWhere: Exclusively online at emceestudios.com\nWhy: For the uninitiated, Emcee is a unique e-commerce site that harnesses the power of content creators to partner with brands and expand the way we shop in 2023. It makes sense, then, why it co-sponsored Luar’s knockout runway show at NYFW, and subsequently asked Raul Lopez and three Emcee creators to collaborate on the brand’s signature Ana bag. Uniekue (@uniekue), Valerie Zhang (@valslooks), and Anna Molinari (@annamolinstinct), pictured here, all brought their creative expressions to life by riffing on Lopez’s design.\nWho: Veronica de Piante\nWhat: Fall collection \nWhere: Exclusively online at net-a-porter.com \nWhy: Following the initial launch of her debut collection in fall 2022, designer Veronica de Piante garnered a swath of critical acclaim, including a nod from Net-a-Porter, who called her “a name to know.” The luxury retailer is now doubling down on this claim, announcing they will be the designer’s exclusive retail partner. The 10-piece offering showcases de Piante’s range, spotlighting expertly tailored trousers, a leather trench coats, and a beautifully draped georgette gown. One notable standout: a duchess silk jacket trimmed with her signature embroidery, hand-sewn by Palestinian and Syrian artists in Jordan in an effort to foster economic independence among refugees. \nWho: Monica Rich Kosann and Gracie Wiener\nWhat: The MRK x Ironic Boat and Tote collection\nWhere: Online at monicarichkosann.com\nWhy: Monica Rich Kosann has partnered with Gracie Wiener of @ironicboatandtote, known for popularizing unexpected monograms on classic L.L.Bean tote bags, on a capsule collection of six internet-y phrases (IYKYK, subtle, yikes, LOL) engraved on pendant necklaces in sterling silver and 18K yellow gold. “I live for personalized pieces that are playful and fun, so it’s been a dream to transform a timeless modern heirloom into something a tad cheeky and unexpected—IYKYK,” Wiener says in a press release. (We know.)\nWho: The SIL and The Beverly Hills Hotel\nWhat: Capsule collection and residency\nWhere: Exclusively online at thesilshop.com and at The Beverly Hills Hotel later this month\nWhy: Editor-loved e-commerce site The SIL, founded by Natalie Bloomingdale as a platform for independent designers creating one-of-a-kind pieces (it’s an acronym for Stuff I Love), has partnered with The Beverly Hills Hotel on an exclusive capsule that pays tribute its legendary original owner, Margaret J. Anderson. To do so, Bloomingdale tapped six talented women in the fashion space to each create a piece, which are all available to shop online now and will be displayed at a trunk show later this month in one of the property’s bungalows. We’re calling dibs on this sequin-lined robe coat.\nWho: Swarovski\nWhat: Created Diamonds Galaxy Collection \nWhere: Online at swarovski.com and at Swarovski stores\nWhy: Swarovski’s creative director Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert took inspiration from the cosmos for her first collection of Created Diamonds, entitled Galaxy, naturally. The starburst studs, earrings, and necklaces combine her unique eye for luxury with lab-grown diamonds for a result that looks like the real thing.\nWho: Zegna and The Elder Statesman\nWhat: Collaborative collection\nWhere: Online at zegna.com and elder-statesman.com\nWhy: Zegna’s Oasi Cashmere program is on its way to becoming a fully traceable operation, bringing transparency to a usually murky process of cashmere production. The brand remains committed to using the finest textiles in the world, which makes its first Oasi creative partnership with Los Angeles-based cashmere purveyors The Elder Statesman so fitting. The Elder Statesman’s focus on craft and easy-going, colorful L.A. vibe finds a match with Zegna’s Milanese sensibilities, resulting in a unisex collaboration that is deadly soft and ready for the streets...or sofa.\nWho: Mother Denim\nWhat: Petite sizing\nWhere: Online at motherdenim.com\nWhy: Calling all short girls: Mother Denim is rolling out petite sizing for fall with the aptly named Lil’ Mother collection. The five-piece capsule includes adjustments of some the brand’s key styles (higher knee placement, shorter inseam and rise), including The Hustler Ankle Fray (pictured here with an oversize comb for scale).\nWho: Port Tanger and Renell Medrano\nWhat: Sunglasses collaboration\nWhere: Online at porttanger.com\nWhy: Port Tanger is the freshest eyewear brand on the market, bringing a global vision and world-class craftsmanship to effortlessly cool pieces you simply can’t find anywhere else. For the latest in its “Visited By” series, it invited photographer and New York cool girl Renell Medrano to bring her Dominican heritage and street sensibility to a group of shades ranging from the smaller Mektoub  to the wrap-around Nunny (pictured here) in the greatest eggplant purple hue.\nWho: Mulberry and Stefan Cooke\nWhat: Limited-edition capsule\nWhere: Online at mulberry.com \nWhy: Mulberry is putting its money where its mouth is—bringing sustainability and circularity front and center while also supporting emerging designer Stefan Cooke, who was invited to rework 27 Mulberry vintage bags for his London Fashion Week runway show.

Customers and fans will find his take on boarding school-chic tailoring, and his beloved Hector bags in the shape of his dachshund, and more.\nWho: Mansur Gavriel\nWhat: Anniversary Collection\nWhere: Online at mansurgavriel.com\nWhy: It’s hard to believe that it’s been 10 whole years since Mansur Gavriel first introduced its iconic bucket bag and tote, sending fashion girls everywhere into a collective tizzy.

Fittingly, the house celebrated the opening with hordes of its closest friends, including Chase Sui Wonders, Lil Nas X, and Molly Gordon. On the menu? Fragrances, vending machines, and a life-size Chance bottle photo-op. The diner is free and open to the public from September 8 through September 10 from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Walk-ins are welcome!\nWho: Jonathan Cohen and Larroudé\nWhat: Shoe collaboration\nWhere: Online at larroude.com and jonathancohenstudio.com\nWhy: Two of the buzziest brands in fashion today, Jonathan Cohen and Larroudé, have come together to create a collection of shoes and boots adorned with the ready-to-wear designer’s signature prints, which were shown at his SS24 presentation during New York Fashion Week. “Combining Marina’s classic shapes and craft with our signature prints and upcycled components feels like a full-circle moment,” Cohen tells ELLE.com exclusively. “We are thrilled to share it with the world!”\nWho: Ba&sh\nWhat: Knitwear pop-up shop through the end of September\nWhere: 61 Crosby Street, New York City\nWhy: A little slice of Paris in the heart of Soho? Why not? Just in time for NYFW, ba&sh, the French brand known for classic staples with a certain je ne sais quoi, has unveiled an immersive pop-up shop in Soho dedicated to knitwear, including its popular Gaspard cardigan.\nWho: Sacai and Carhartt WIP\nWhat: Collaborative capsule\nWhere: Online at carthartt-wip.com, sacai.com, and at Sacai retail locations\nWhy: Sacai’s take on utilitarian staples has gained the brand a cult following for its artful take on workwear basics. Fitting, then, that for FW23, it debuted a collaboration with Carhartt WIP on the runway that includes knit cardigans, pleated skirts, and, of course, a chore jacket that is anything but basic. \nWho: Farrow & Ball and Christopher John Rogers\nWhat: Paint and wallpaper collaboration\nWhere: Online at farrow-ball.com and at Farrow & Ball stores\nWhy: Christopher John Rogers is slowly becoming a global lifestyle brand, on his own terms. As perhaps the greatest colorist working in American fashion today, Rogers knows what shades complement each other (or clash just so), so it’s fitting that he took his vision to the world of interiors. British paint and wallpaper authority Farrow & Ball worked with the designer on a range of 12 bold colors and three wallpaper prints that mix and match as well as Rogers’ ready-to-wear pieces.

{"title": "The 13 Best Root Touch-Ups to Buy You Time Between Salon Visits", "date": "2023-09-29 20:38:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFor every hair type, texture, and color. \nHair color trends come and go–red hair is particularly hot right now–but even when grown-in roots are trending (as they currently are), there’s still a camp that wants their hair to remain one shade. As a fake blonde with dark roots, I get it. As I approach the two-month mark after a blonde-ing sesh and my brunette base starts to creep down my strands, it’s all I can see when I look in the mirror. But going to the salon every eight weeks just isn’t in the cards for me. That’s where the best root touch-up products come in. \nIf you don’t have a balayage dye job or something similar that’s meant to be root-heavy, “A root touch-up product is a good way to help your color last longer in between salon visits,” explains Samantha Denis, a former hair colorist and founder of haircare brand, allyoos. “You’d use a root touch-up product when you're not quite ready to see your colorist, but your roots are starting to show and you start noticing a line of demarcation.” Beyond covering grays or other root growth, root touch-ups can also be used to play around with your hair color in a quick, temporary way in lieu of going for a major color change or daring chop. Say, you have natural blonde hair but want to try the smudge-y root trend without actually dyeing it, simply use a root touch-up in a darker shade to achieve the look. \nWhatever your reason for using a root touch-up might be, there’s a product for you. I’ve rounded up some of my personal favorites, along with top-reviewed products. Pro colorists Denis and balayage expert Abby Haliti also weighed in to share their thoughts on these 13 root touch-ups.  From brush-on powders and crayons to sprays and even temporary dyes, here, find the formula that will best suit your hair needs.\nLooking for a more permanent option that you don’t have to worry about rinsing or sweating away? “This option offers a higher level of saturation, resulting in a deeper and more comprehensive coverage,” says Haliti. “Additionally, it features a more liquid base and lower levels of ammonia, making it an ideal choice for those seeking even greater depth of color.” Available in 15 shades, this DIY coloring kit has everything you need to cover your roots in as little as ten minutes and will last you several weeks. We especially love the mess-free brush for an easy application. \nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve never done my own hair. I had no time to get it done before a big trip overseas; I used one box of this before leaving and it worked perfectly. I was shocked at my own ability to ‘erase’ the grays and not spoil my natural hair color around it. During the trip, I repeated with less fear and perfect again. Please use this if you can’t get to your salon. I promise it works.”\nFor a waterproof option that's “a quick and easy solution for covering up hair,” according to Haliti, try Tarte’s Dab & Go Hair Concealer. The cream-to-powder formula is easy to apply thanks to its sponge applicator that allows you to dab and go as the name implies. Similar to the brand’s face makeup products, this formula is made with Amazonian clay for seamless blending. It also taps scalp and hair-loving oils including argan, grapeseed, and castor for moisturizing benefits. All you have to do is press the applicator into the lid to dispense concealer, then dab the formula onto your roots or areas of thinning for buildable coverage.\nTarte rating: 4.3/5 stars\nA Tarte reviewer says: “Extremely handy product! Now I have no stress due to breaking through gray hair or lack of density at the temples. Very convenient to use! The release form is beyond praise.”\nIf you’re traveling or going to an event where you’re worried that you may need a root touch-up on the go, this is the product for you. “This has a really nice, velvety formula that is easy to apply, spread, and smudge into your root area,” says Denis. “It’ll almost feel like you’re using makeup on your hair. They have great coverage and wash out well, which is important because you don’t want to block your real root touch-up from penetrating when you finally do head back to the salon.” Note: there are only two shades to choose from as they're mostly intended for blending and covering grays. \nSephora rating: 3.8/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “This product is great for a quick fix... especially when I need to tie my hair up. It stays on well and doesn't come off in my hands if I touch my hair.”\nIf you’ve ever DIYed a dye job, you know that it can get messy. You might expect the same out of a root cover-up product, and while some of them might not be the neatest to apply, that’s not the case with this targeted mist. “The spray-on application of this product makes it incredibly easy to use, allowing you to quickly and accurately apply it to your desired area,” says Haliti. It also comes in nine different shades to effectively blend in with a range of hair colors.\nTarget rating: 4/5 stars\nA Target reviewer says: “I absolutely love this product. The coverage is amazing with such a light coat. The color blend is perfect. It last all day. I wish these products were less transferable, but it’s way better than other brands I’ve tried. This is my new must have.”\nEssentially like an eye shadow, but for your hair, root touch-up powders are a staple in most hair stylists’ kits—and not just because they have a lot of clients who color their manes. Although this powder is great for covering grays, it can also be used directly on your scalp in your part, at your temples, or in other areas of sparseness as a hack to help your hair appear thicker and fuller. With the accompanying brush, it’s easier to apply exactly where you want it, rather than using a messy aerosol. You could also apply it with your fingers if you were really in a pinch. \nSephora rating: 4/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “This product is amazing, it covers my gray hair a lot and is perfect for a touch-up. The best thing is I don’t have to color my hair every three to four weeks to cover my grays.”\nEfficient, yes. Effective, yes. Pricey, also yes–you need to purchase the spray gun in order to dispense the formula and each refillable pod will cost you $39. But if you’re a makeup lover, you can use this airbrush system for a number of other things from foundation and blush to body makeup– which is why I own the airbrush gun and just had to purchase the root touch-up pod. Thankfully, the pods are full of more concentrated liquid and the gun dispenses it into a fine mist, so you don’t need to use too much product at a time. In fact, each pod can last up to 120 uses, so if you’re going to be using this kit a lot, it’s a more justifiable purchase. My favorite part is the root touch-up doesn’t weigh hair down, leave it looking matte or greasy, nor leave it feeling sticky or gunked up. There are eight shades to choose from, even a pure white and gray hue should you want to amp up your platinum or lightened color.  \nTEMPTU rating: 4.5/5 stars\nA TEMPTU reviewer says: “This root touch-up stays on for days when I skip washing. It’s nice because I don’t have to apply hair spray. It washes out with the next wash and I start over. I am able to extend my salon color treatment from every four weeks to every seven or eight weeks because 0f this product.”\nI have a love-hate relationship with my blonde hair. I swore I would never go all the way to the root with my highlights because my hair grows way too fast (a good thing, I know!), but alas, I have gone blonder and blonder. Now that my highlights start closer to the scalp, root growth is a real problem for me. But this little brush-on product is my permanent solution. Formulated by celebrity colorist Justin Anderson, the heat-activated product is packed with hydrogen peroxide, lemon juice, and purple pigments to lighten and brighten for a fresh blonde effect when I need it. I simply apply it to areas that need a little boost, then blow dry to activate the formula. \nUlta rating: 3.3/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I’m shocked this works so well. I’ve had natural light blonde hair for 41 years, then it started fading. My roots were getting a little darker, a little gray/silver. I want my blonde hair, but I’m not willing to go to the salon every six weeks to keep it up. This product is AMAZING! I brush it into my wet hair, blow dry, and instant highlights. I’m a huge fan.”\nSimilar to the brand’s other styling products, the R+Co Bright Shadows Root Touch-Up spray has a lovely uplifting scent called Rosy Eyed, which is comprised of bergamot, wild fig, and tonka beans. It comes in seven shades and feels more like a styling product than a root touch-up. Plus, it’s pretty enough to display on your vanity. Furthermore, it’s formulated with good-for-hair ingredients like biotin and pearl extract, which enhance shine. \nDermstore rating: 4/5 stars\nA Dermstore reviewer says: “Looking at my roots is frustrating because my hair grows rapidly. I have long hair, so root touch-ups and refresh coloring is a time-consuming process for me. I prolong as much as possible to ensure my hair’s strength and health. Finding Bright Shadows Root Touch-Up Spray from R+Co was the best treasure. I’m so thankful I found this spray. It covers everything and holds the color until I wash my hair. I haven’t experienced anything horrible with this spray, it truly doesn’t transfer to clothes, people etc. It stays on the hair. The easy spray is quick and manageable. So happy!”\nSpecifically formulated for gray coverage, this full-pigment stick features a crayon side and a sponge side. The cream-to-powder crayon is wax-free, so it won’t feel waxy or clog the hair follicle and is easy rinse out when you’re ready. The real beauty of this product is its sponge, however, which allows for easy blending and the most realistic-looking gray coverage.\nUlta rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I was on the fence about buying a product to cover my gray patchiness. I was looking for something easy and hassle-free. I am 50-something and get little white/gray patches near my temples that are very noticeable. This product covered them with ease with a very light touch and was so easy to color on. The price was right, too. This product surpassed my expectations. I will re-order when the time comes to replenish. Don’t think about it, just give this one a shot. It won’t disappoint!”\nOK, you caught me, this isn’t technically a root touch-up product, but that doesn’t mean it can’t double as one. If you’ve ever experienced greasy hair, you know that it makes strands look darker. Enter: This dry shampoo for light-colored hair that nixes grease and brightens just slightly for a cleaner, more vibrant-looking mane. I swear by this even when my hair isn’t greasy, because it allows me to buy some extra time before I need a more serious root-concealing product. The formula comes in a version for dark tones as well. \nSephora rating: 4.6/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “I have very fine, thin, light blond hair. This is the first dry shampoo I’ve ever repurchased, and I’ve tried them all. I will be sticking with this one for sure.”\nMadison Reed is known for their at-home hair color products, phenomenal customer service, and helpful tutorials and video consultations to help you navigate the process (the latter being a game-changer for me during quarantine) And chances are, if you're covering gray hairs on your head, you might see a few sprouting throughout your brows, too. This root concealer powder works for covering both, complete with a handy dual-ended tool featuring a mini spoolie and brush to make covering brow hairs a breeze. Even if grays aren’t your issue, you can use this as a brow or scalp fill-in product to achieve fuller-looking brows and hair. \nUlta rating: 4.7/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I’ve been using another brand of root touch up powder and thought I’d try this since I use Madison Reed hair color. This color was suggested for my hair, and it matches perfectly! I was using another eyebrow powder, but this one is perfect. So happy I ordered it!”\nFor color-boosting and styling all in one, the Clairol Root Touch-Up Spray is a good choice. It offers volumizing benefits so that your hair is left looking full and freshly colored. We like this one for covering grays in particular versus dark root growth. Because it’s a two-in-one product, it’s a great option for travel to maximize space in your toiletry bag.\nAmazon rating: 4.1/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “My hair is thin, so I try to stretch out my color as long as possible. When the roots start showing gray, I can get a few more days by using this. It’s a bit of a learning curve to use it without getting it all over your forehead, but when used as intended it’s great!”\nThis portable root touch-up powder comes in ten flexible shades but is especially great for redheads, as there’s a few shades of red to choose from. And if you’re a bottle redhead, you know that your color fades fast, so it can be helpful to add a little extra boost in between salon visits. Its small size makes it easy to travel with and the sponge applicator is perfect for dipping into the powder and applying to roots.\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer say: “This product is awesome! I have some thinning at the top of my head near my forehead, and it covers my scalp perfectly. You would never know. Plus, it also covers the gray, and gives you a little more time before it’s time to have it colored. I highly recommend this product. I will never be without it, and it lasts a very long time.”\n“Root touch-up products are specially formulated to help cover up or blend in new hair growth at the roots between salon visits,” says Haliti. “These products are designed to temporarily conceal gray hairs or visible roots, providing a quick and convenient solution for maintaining a polished look.” They come in spray, stick, and powder form, along with some permanent formulations.\nAccording to Denis, “the best way to choose your color is to ask your colorist if they recommend a root touch-up product for you. If you are browsing and come across one, the best way to match on your own would be to do a strand test and see if it blends into the rest of your strands after smudging and blending it in a bit with your fingers or a brush,” she adds. \nThe answer is that it really depends on what type of root touch-up product you’re using. Naturally, the best way to apply each formula is by following the usage directions. If you’re using a stick, Haliti advises “drawing it onto your root area, then using your fingers to smudge and blend it in.” If you’re using a spray, generally, you should hold the can about six inches from your head, then spray. You can distribute the product and allow it to settle into strands by brushing it through with a bristle brush. Meanwhile, powders tend to come with an application tool like a brush, sponge, or spoolie to apply the product directly to your roots.\nNo matter which type of product you’re using, though, “start with clean, dry hair and section your hair before applying the product according to the instructions,\" says Denis. “Then, blend it in and style as desired.” \nIn most cases, root touch-ups are just a temporary solution, so they’ll “last until you wash your hair,” says Denis, who adds that “a good formula will wash out easily with shampoo.” But, if you’re using a permanent touch-up like the L’Oréal Magic Root Rescue, then you’ll buy yourself a bit more time.  \n“All shades can probably get away with using some form of root touch-up, but it might be harder to match blonde and red shades since they vary so much,” says Denis. Blondes and reds can be cool, warm, or somewhere in between, so “darker shades will be the easiest to blend and match,” Denis adds. Some brands might not even offer red shades at all, so red-haired folks may also need to do a little more legwork to find a good match. \n“The frequency of root touch-ups varies based on factors like hair growth rate, desired coverage, and personal preference,” explains Haliti. “Darker hair colors may require more frequent touch-ups due to noticeable regrowth, while lighter hair colors may have longer intervals between touch-ups.”\nSamantha Denis is the founder of allyoos and former hair stylist, colorist, and product developer.\nAbby Haliti is a celebrity colorist and a master of the French Balayage technique.

{"title": "10 Biotin Shampoos For Fuller, Voluminous Hair", "date": "2023-09-29 21:38:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDo biotin shampoos really work? A dermatologist weighs in.  \nNot all of us have the luck of being born with Cindy Crawford’s luscious locks. Most of us must work harder to achieve the voluminous hair we dream of. Of course, an easy fix may be to “just get extensions,” but it’s not as simple as it seems. Extensions often weigh down your scalp and, even worse, cause permanent hair damage. Here's where biotin shampoos come in. \n“Biotin is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin (vitamin B7) that has important roles in cellular metabolism and signaling,” New York-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Tiffany Libby, tells ELLE.com. Simply put, biotin has long been touted for its hair-strengthening properties. “It is used in biotin shampoos as it is believed to strengthen hair follicles and increase scalp circulation and hair density. While there is limited clinical data that points to the use of oral or topical biotin for promoting hair and nail growth in healthy patients, some patients find it helpful in helping to thicken and strengthen hair,” she explains. \nThe shower is where your hair gets all the attention it’s craving. If you are someone who has been bleaching and coloring your hair since the beginning of time, your hair probably needs some extra TLC. For biotin shampoo to give you the results you desire, you must keep an eye out for some key ingredients that support your hair in every way, such as vitamins and natural oils—both promoting hair growth. Luckily, we polled experts and perused dozens of customer reviews to find the eight best biotin shampoos to start your hair care journey.  \nPutting your trust in shampoo when experiencing hair loss is quite the gamble. Honeydew’s Biotin Shampoo is one that won’t let you down. This Amazon bestseller features natural oils, including coconut oil, as well as vitamins, biotin, and keratin that thoroughly cleanse the scalp to create a clean slate for new growth to sprout. \nSize: 8 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This product saved my long hair. I started using it after I experienced some hair loss. After using it the first time, my hair stopped falling out. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend for people losing their hair.”\nIn this shampoo, biotin is supported by vitamin B3 and pea spout extract to enrich the hair and scalp with nutrients and encourage blood circulation for growth.\nSize: 8 fl oz\nWalmart rating: 4.6/5 stars\n“I’ve been using this shampoo (and the conditioner) for about six weeks. I have curly hair and haven’t gotten a trim, so I don’t know if my hair has grown. However, I have noticed less hair falling out when I wash and brush my tresses. I don’t love how my strands feel after I use just the shampoo—it feels slightly rubbery; however, after using the corresponding conditioner, my hair returns to its soft state.”—Danielle James, Beauty Director ELLE.com \nMielle Organic’s Rosemary Mint Oil isn’t the only product in the line that deserves the hype. Before you even get to the oil step, the Rosemary Mint Shampoo is a godsend for those looking to repair breakage-prone and brittle hair over time. It is a slow-burner, so don’t expect immediate results, but rest assured your hair is in good hands. \nSize: 12 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I have been using this product for years and have always thought it has helped my hair tremendously. The scent is amazing. I pair this shampoo with the hair mask and it truly does wonders!!! For reference, I have 3B curly hair.”\nNutrafol Root Purifier Shampoo is made for anyone looking to strengthen their locks in just a matter of two weeks. It is formulated to clean hair from the root, without causing damage and stripping the scalp of its natural oils. The main ingredient, Vegan protein, is used to replenish moisture and build the nutrients you need for hair growth.\nSize: 8.1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5 stars\n\"Because of my zig zag hair pattern, breakage can happen frequently with my hair. I started using Nutrafol to strengthen my hair strands in hopes of less shedding and more length retention. I've used it for  four months now, about 3 times a month and I actually see a difference. The only reason I'm not using it more frequently is because I'm always testing other products. Nevertheless, it has a prime spot in my coveted shower caddy.\"Danielle James, Beauty Director ELLE.com\nThis R+Co shampoo is focused on nourishment as much as it encourages growth. Your hair is coated in a rich formula that includes coconut oil, vitamin b5, and biotin, which imparts a healthy shine and fluffy bounce.\nSize: 8.5 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “Probably my favorite shampoo of all time ever. I have fine, straight hair, and this shampoo gives my hair life and bounce. It’s magical!!!!”\nWith over 7,000 ratings, this Amazon bestseller has built a community of fans for the enviable results it offers. Biotin and collagen are the MVPs of this composition for strengthening and boosting the hair’s health. \nSize: 13 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve definitely seen a positive change in my hair growth after using this shampoo for just a couple of weeks! No more chunks of hair falling out anymore, thankfully. Definitely recommend.”\nGorgeous results aside, color or chemical treatments aren’t always our best friends. However, if your hair struggles to find its strength, this Pureology shampoo is the best friend you never knew you needed. Found in this mix is keravis, a powerful compound used to fortify every strand to prevent further breakage or damage. \nSize: 9 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.7/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This may be the best hair product out there. I’ve tried many, both cheap and expensive. This one is expensive, but if you value your hair and can afford it, try this out. It’s great.”\nGRO Revitalizing Shampoo can transform your hair from dullness to shine. The product is used to minimize shedding and increase the appearance of density. It is safe for everyday use to give your hair the body it desires.\nSize: 8 fl oz\nVegamour star rating: 4.7/5 starsA Vegamour reviewer said: “This may be the best hair product out there. I’ve tried many, both cheap and expensive. This one is expensive, but if you value your hair and can afford it, try this out. It’s great.”\nIf you need a holy grail staple in your beauty cabinet, the Ouai Fine Hair Shampoo should be one of them. This color-safe shampoo makes your four or five-day-old hair feel clean while providing hydration to your curls and coils. The main ingredient, Chia Seed Oil, helps increase the appearance of thickness and volume. The Ouai Fine Hair Shampoo pretty much does it all.\nSize: 10 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.7/5 starsA Sephora reviewer said: “I’ve tried almost all of the top shampoo/conditioners that Sephora offers and this has by far been the best for my fine hair! I’ve gotten so many compliments on how healthy my hair looks since I started using it. Beautiful scent and formula. Holy grail for sure!!”\nDry, brittle hair is no challenge for L’oreal’s Inforcer shampoo. This shampoo cleanses the hair without stripping it of the nutrients it needs to remain defensive against external threats and contains biotin and vitamins to stimulate growth.\nSize: 16.9 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “Best price for the quality and less than a salon markup for daily shampoo.”\nUsing biotin shampoo alone isn’t nearly as effective as having a full-fledged, biotin-rich routine. “Some patients have reported hair growth and stronger hair, along with reduced hair loss, but shampoos as a delivery method for ingredients may not be ideal as they are lathered onto the scalp and hair, and rinsed off shortly afterward,” Dr. Tiffany Libby explains. After shampoo and conditioning, Dr. Libby advises using other topical biotin products elsewhere in your routine. Enter: hair serums.\n“If there is interest in using topical biotin, I would recommend a leave-on daily treatment, like SpoiledChild A22 Biotin Boost Hair + Scalp Serum, formulated with rosemary oil, caffeine, and niacinamide, and has demonstrated hair growth benefits. It is an elegant, lightweight formulation in an easy-to-use spray that is fast-absorbing and residue-free, and does not weigh hair down while it is working on the scalp,” she explains. \n“You can use a biotin shampoo as often as you need to shampoo your hair,” Dr. Libby says.\nWhile biotin has been known for encouraging growth, Dr. Libby advises looking for products that contain “other ingredients that help cleanse the scalp and remove residue, and ingredients that support hair growth like caffeine and rosemary oil, and prevent hair loss like saw palmetto extract,” she says.\nDr. Tiffany Libby, NYC-based double board-certified dermatologist who specializes in cosmetic and laser dermatology\nNerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "The 25 Best Ulta Products ELLE Editors Are Obsessed With", "date": "2023-09-30 01:19:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFrom a lash-boosting mascara to ultra-hydrating moisturizer.\nWalking into an Ulta store or browsing its online catalogs makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. With thousands of makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products, the popular beauty retailer nearly always has what I’m looking for—plus a few extra impulse purchases I can’t resist adding to my cart. \nAnd while some may think of Ulta as Sephora’s less sophisticated younger sister, don’t be fooled. Alongside its wide selection of budget-friendly and drugstore favorites (hello to this TikTok-viral Maybelline mascara!), they also carry hundreds of luxury beauty products from coveted labels like Pat McGrath Labs, Chanel, Lancome, and Dior. Moral of the story: Whether you’re looking to save a few dollars as student loan payments return or are in the mood to do some major retail therapy, Ulta is the one-stop shop to satisfy any beauty lover’s cravings.\nAnother perk I’d like to mention is that Ulta has a fantastic loyalty program. Similar to Sephora’s program, you can earn points for every dollar you spend and get exclusive gifts and discounts depending on your membership tier. However, Ulta offers some additional benefits like two times the points during your birthday month; your points go a bit farther here (500 points can be redeemed for $17.50, while at Sephora, 500 points get you $10 off.) Although you do have to spend at least $25 to get free shipping at Ulta, depending on your membership level, it’s not that hard to qualify for, given the sheer abundance of goodies you’ll likely want to stock up on.\nI could easily wax poetic about Ulta, but let’s go shopping, shall we? Ahead, I’ve shared a few of my beauty staples and tapped discerning ELLE editors for their must-have finds available at Ulta. Add these gems to your lineup, we promise you won’t regret it.\n“As a serial lipstick dater, I have a hard time committing to just one formula. Urban Decay’s Vice Lip Bond has me recently testing out the whole monogamy thing because quite frankly, this product is incredible. The shade range is the stuff of my vibrant dreams (looking at you, Solo Player!), and one swipe can hold up for a jam-packed day.” —Bianca Rodriguez, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Manager \n“I can’t count the amount of sunscreens I’ve tested over the years, but of all of them, this one is unbeatable. Not only does it effectively protect my skin from UVA/UVB rays, but the formula is also unmatched. It never leaves a white cast, creamily blends into the skin, and best of all, is non-comedogenic, so it never causes a breakout.”—Tatjana Freund, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor\n“I have lots of hair, but the strands are soft and fine. Too much product and it can really weigh down my 4B/4C curls. This curl cream not only smells divine, but is also lightweight and defines my curls. I have low porosity hair. However, with this curl cream, I don’t have to work too hard to get my hair to absorb the product. Highly recommend for my low-porosity sisters!”—Danielle James, ELLE.com Digital Beauty Director\n“You can never have too much blush. However, this pigmented duo palette from Juvia’s Place delivers insane color payoff with just one swipe. The duo comes with a light and deep shade of blush so you can layer each on top of one other or give them their own time to shine.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com Beauty Commerce Editor\n“I will give you one little truth of the beauty industry: When it comes to mascara, drugstore ones are just as good as luxury ones. I know this, yet when I saw my friend Claire with the kind of long, fluttery eyelashes you only see on babies or straight men who don’t need them, I thought the answer had to be a luxury brand. It was this—and when I tried it for myself, I understood why. My lashes are fine and point straight down, but this made them longer, fuller, and thicker in just a few coats.”—Kathleen Hou, ELLE Beauty Director\nMy combo skin is an annoying amalgam of contradictions—shine here, flaky patches there!—but Fresh’s deep hydration cream has become my go-to moisturizer for a fix-all remedy. My skin instantly soaks up this rich formula, yet isn’t left feeling greasy or sticky in the slightest. I love that it not only provides long-lasting hydration with a blend of hyaluronic acids, but also soothes redness from my uncouth prodding via rose extract. And to top it all off, it smells like an actual floral bouquet.\n“Meeting Donni Davy, Euphoria’s lead makeup artist, and her line of cosmetics last year quite possibly changed me. Half Magic’s hues pack a punch, and this eye paint and eyeliner combo product is no different. I’ll opt for this weekly in place of my good ol’ black eyeliner when I want a pop of color. The results always make me smile.”—BR\n“T3’s Airebrush Duo was my go-to for quickly transforming my curls into a sleek blowout. However, this newer version is the only tool that’s good enough to make me set it down for the first time in three years. The larger, oval-shaped barrel still adds volume to the hair, but it allows me to cut down my styling time.”—TF\n“Founder Alicia Yoon grew up with eczema and has spent years explaining what a ‘skin barrier’ was before I even knew it was a thing. For my friends with hypersensitive skin and who definitely can’t use a retinol but still want something effective, I always suggest a Peach & Lily product—specifically this serum. I’ve been through at least three of these serums because it is a steady product that helps to consistently brighten skin and moisturize.”—KH\n“The amount of Thigh Rescue’s I own is frankly borderline embarrassing. Yet, if a product is going to grant world peace—a.k.a. no irritating chafing for my thighs in hot humid months—why wouldn’t I keep this in every handbag I own?”—BR\n“Of all of Chanel’s products, this multi-use stick is criminally underrated and by far my favorite. I use the shade 'Transparent' to add a natural-looking dewy highlight at the top of my cheeks. For an even bolder look, you can layer on a powder highlighter for a budge-proof gleam. If you prefer even more glow, the pinkier shades work great as blush.”—TF\n“My primer aversion was reversed after just one use of the E.L.F Cosmetics Power Grip Primer. This bestseller and TikTok-favorite keeps my makeup stuck for hours. My trick is to use this primer when I’m wearing matte products to impart a natural, healthy shine, as matte formulas can make me look powdery and flat.”—NP\nEllis Brooklyn’s Salt Eau de Parfum reminds me that summer isn’t just a season, it’s a mentality. This warm, slightly floral, slightly salty scent is like nostalgia in a bottle for me when NYC winters turn frightening.\n“Do I need another palette? No. Did I buy this with my own money? Absolutely. The palette contains a universal highlighter and four shimmery eyeshadows that together look like the top of an ancient statue. The green shadow is my go-to shade, and the highlighter and eyeshadows are buildable. I bought it as a collector’s item, but I’ll need to purchase another one because I’ve been using the palette so frequently!”—DJ\n“I have scraped jars of Hanahana beauty with my fingernails, wiping every crevice clean like a dog trying to get every bit of peanut butter out of a jar. I generally find moisturizing my body a chore, but when this sits on my vanity, I suddenly find myself very motivated. It combines the scent of a calm-inducing lavender and the rich, but not greasy touch of this shea butter. When I’ve coated my whole body in this, I feel like a shiny, slippery, well-moisturized dolphin.”—KH\n“For my unruly brows, nothing works as effectively as the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel. As far as basics go, this one will never leave my side. It completely tames my brow hairs, even in horrible New York humidity. I can’t tell you how many tubes I’ve gone through.\"—TF\n“Not to be dramatic, but I truly believe every New Yorker (or just general over-populated city-goer) needs this serum in their welcome bag. The key is in the kombucha, which provides serious protection against harsh climates all day. The difference in my skin compared to some friends who haven’t made the switch is quite noticeable (but let’s keep that secret between us).” —BR\n“All I’ve wanted to do recently is put glitter on my eyelids with the enthusiasm of a kindergartener discovering shiny objects for the first time. This ‘glitter puck’ makes my eyes gleam like they’ve been lightly dusted with fairy dust. Donni Davy is a glitter connoisseur and always coming up with a new shade or shape of glitter that I haven’t seen before.” —KH\n“There’s been a lot of hype on the Internet about the Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, and I’m here to confirm it. I never thought a single hair product could make such a difference in my blowout routine. Not only does it dramatically cut down on styling time, but it also keeps humidity at bay so that I can style less throughout the week. Even on my curly, dry hair, a blowout with this spray gives me a sleek, shiny look that lasts.”—TF\n“One of the best tube mascaras on the market! I often have trouble with product settling underneath my eyes (I have long bottom lashes). The wand allows me to paint them perfectly with minimal mess.”—DJ\nSam Peters is a Senior Commerce Editor at Hearst covering fashion, beauty and lifestyle.

{"title": "The Best Looks From Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2024", "date": "2023-09-30 16:36:00", "text": "The fashion month calendar culminates in the City of Lights.\nKiko Kostadinov’s spring collection made me want to be more bold. It made me want to wear orange and black stripes, colorful furry wrap coats, and tunics over pants. Black, light grey, and cargo hues were offset by chartreuse green, cobalt blue, and candy pink. Hem and neck lines were equally asymmetric, and jackets were purposefully buttoned askew. Patterns, colors, and styles were unconventionally paired in ways that might have seem haphazard to an untrained eye. The lesson: stop getting dressed and start playing dress-up.—Meg Donohue, associate fashion commerce editor \nMiuccia Prada's finger has been on the pulse of youth culture and its future for the last few seasons, and this preppy-beachy collection is no different. She continued with the multiple layers exploration, this time with prep school blazers, oxford button downs, bikini bottoms and surf shorts in varying shades of navy, orange, and yellow. She countered the more encumbering looks with fresh bandana-style leather tube tops and matching skirts, plus a healthy dose of jacquard. With another all-star cast including Troye Sivan and Cailee Spaeny, Mrs. Prada closed out fashion week showing she may be generations away from the youth in her cast, but she's all too aware of how we dress, and how we want to dress, and how we should dress. —Kevin LeBlanc, fashion associate\nJohn Galliano is a master of character study and development, and his co-ed Margiela collection brought the most excitement to the runway all week. Every look, deconstructed, repinned, and held just so, told a story with each gesture, whether with the intentional removal of a shoulder pad or the exaggeration of a skirt's hem. Galliano's inspiration was of inheritance, and how that translates through clothing passed through generations. One can't help but to think of a daughter throwing on her father's massive blazer, or a child ensconced in their grandmother's corseted dresses. With Galliano, the possibilities for imagination and stories is endless. —Kevin LeBlanc, fashion associate\nFirst and foremost, the Mugler runway was star-studded. Models included Angela Bassett, Paris Hilton, Helena Christensen, Irina Shayk, Amber Valletta, and Fan Bingbing. The collection was, as expected, full of sex appeal, exposed flesh, and geometric cut-outs. The shapes and hyper-structured silhouettes signature to the brand were, of course, present, as were de-constructed thigh-high boots, colored fringe, and tinsel. There were more than few freed nipples and one entirely translucent, hard-sided breastplate (glass?) that might have stolen the show if it weren’t for Angela Bassett. Did I mention her?—Meg Donohue, associate fashion commerce editor \nRokh’s spring/summer 2024 collection proved that the utilitarian trend can still be chic. Sleek tailoring paired well with doily-like white lace, and otherwise classic workwear pieces — trench coats, button downs, and slacks — were reimagined to be slightly twisted. Cropped jackets, elongated belt straps, and weird proportions made the collection semi-normal looking to the naked eye, but up close, you can see the “off” features and oddities that make it interesting. A mostly black and grey color palette and a mostly sleek, sturdy primary fabric were accented with a subtle pop of color & touch-worthy textures: a latex mustard yellow top here, a muted pink and yellow shag dress there. The collection as a whole felt dark, but not heavy or suffocating, perhaps a response to the ultra-loud, gimmicky trends of seasons past that frankly, Rokh has never participated in anyway.—Madison Rexroat, fashion & accessories assistant\nNicolas Ghesquiere took a turn down a flowier, lighter path this season with lots of flouncy maxi skirts pair with lush silk bombers and tops. He's at his best when he's looking at architectural aspects of clothing and subverting them, pushing them towards the future. This was most brilliantly exercised in his reworking on padded swing coats, one in butter yellow that was divine, and his reconfiguration of the tweed tailcoats towards the end of the show, which were fringed, sequined, and checkered to great effect. —Kevin LeBlanc, fashion associate\nThe Best Looks From Milan Fashion Week SS24\nAll the Best Looks From London Fashion Week SS24\nWilly Chavarria Brings Sex Appeal to NYC\nBruceGlen Brought Body Positivity to NYFW\nThe Best Looks From New York Fashion Week SS24\nBrandon Maxwell Presents Dynamic Minimalism\nGabriela Hearst Designs for Chic Women\nTory Burch Hosted Her Own Night at the Museum \nCollina Strada Was an End-Of-Summer Night’s Dream\nI Went to the Kate Spade Show With Ease (Sort Of)\nRalph Lauren Brought His Home to NYFW\nAll The Best Fall/Winter 2023 Couture Looks \nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Our Favorite Fragrances Will Have You Smelling Like A Dream", "date": "2023-09-30 22:32:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nMeet your new signature scent. \nWhen you meet someone, your fragrance is the first thing to introduce you before words leave your mouth. What do you want your scent to say? Are you a burst of energy fueled by bright citrus and fruits? Or maybe you like to be mysterious with sultry tonka beans and woods tickling the noses of every passerby.\nA signature scent is also deeply personal; it can evoke particular memories, elicit a sense of comfort or nostalgia, and even help tell the world about your unique personality. Plus, fragrances can smell quite different on different skin types, which makes finding the best perfumes for women a personalized experience. \n“Fragrance is about the way it makes you feel,” explains Joan Tanis, national training and events director at Maison Francis Kurkjian. “Wearing a scent that works with your specific body chemistry can also enhance your mood and even change behaviors. Fragrance encourages the release of endorphins, which makes us feel good.”\nIf you’re not sure exactly where to start on your scent journey, don’t fret. We’ve scoured customer reviews and tested dozens of buzzy formulas to bring you some of the most exciting perfumes. From summer-centric lavender perfumes to mature vanilla and rich gender-fluid scents, we made it easy to uncover timeless classics or intriguingly unconventional blends—no matter your preference. And the best part? You can order a few samples to compare and contrast your favorites while still deciding, or go all-in on a full-size bottle that doubles as décor once you’ve nailed down your signature fragrance.Also worth noting: Many of these brands offer some amazing perfume gift sets, so you can treat your loved ones to the magical experience of (hopefully) finding their new go-to scents, too. \nSmells like: A sunny Italian vacation \nKey notes: Mandarin, neroli, orange blossom, jasmine, myrrh, musks \nSummer doesn’t seem too far away when you have this scent on hand. Orange Smoke smells exactly like its name—a toasty, citrus scent that's as sweet as it is smoky. \n“If I could bottle up what my vacation on the Amalfi Coast smelled like, it would be eerily similar to Orange Smoke by Dries Van Noten. The mandarin, orange blossom, and neroli notes are warmed up under the sun and deepened with musks to create a bright and warm aroma.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor\nSmells like: Salty citrus\nKey notes: Salted Lemon, pink pepper, musks\nA little bit spicy, citrusy, and woodsy all in one, this super-affordable fragrance has the depth of a much pricier top-shelf perfume. The scent leans neither too masculine nor feminine, meaning it’s one your BF might just be tempted to use, too. \n“I’ve always been a sucker for men’s cologne, but have never actually added any to my routine because I don’t want to smell like a full-on dude.  However, this Le Monde Gourmand scent strikes the perfect balance. Described by the brand as evoking the ‘comforting embrace of an oversized hoodie stolen from your crush,’ it has an effortlessly musky scent without being too rich or overpowering. It’s so good, in fact, I love to spritz it on every few hours for a fresh whiff.”— S.P.  \nSmells like: Creamy woods\nKey notes: Almond, coffee, bergamot lemon; jasmine, orange blossom, tonka bean, cacao, vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli and cedar\nStarting bright and surprising with whiffs of jasmine, this perfume soon turns dark and seductive with traces of coffee and cocoa. A must-have for any wild night in or out. \nAn Amazon reviewer says: “The bottle is what immediately caught my attention, but after I sampled it, I needed to have it. It goes very well with my natural scent; it’s warm and sweet, yet sexy. It’s perfect for everyday wear as well as special occasions.”\nSmells like: Soft, tangy florals\nKey notes: Grapefruit, rose accord\nA fruity, floral fragrance as traditionally feminine as its color, this is a non-fussy pick for day wear.\n“Of all the perfumes I’ve tried over the years, Chanel's Chance has remained a constant in my lineup. It’s lighter and more modern than the brand’s iconic N°5 scent, yet is still just as effortlessly classic and long-lasting. In fact, I’ve found it to be such a universal crowd-pleaser that even an Uber driver once asked me what I was wearing.”—S.P.\nSmells like: Marshmallows and ice cream\nKey notes: Lavender blossom, juicy pear, bergamot, coconut, vanilla orchid, woods, cashmere \nEven if your name isn’t Ari, you can still smell like the superstar with this flirty, feminine perfume. With sweet floral and fruity scents of lavender blossom, pear, coconut, and vanilla, this is a bright, young fragrance, in the best way.\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “That’s it. Steamy cotton candy. I smell like a sexy cavity. Ten out of 10.”\nSmells like: Florals deep in the woods\nKey notes: violet leaves, jasmine, vetiver.\nCreated by the brand that brought us the chicest, most enviable lingerie in the market, the perfumes by La Perla are just as desirable. This scent is citrusy enough to invoke a bold, wide-awake feeling, but countered with dark notes of neroli, too.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Very beautiful, fruity violet perfume. This smells like a rich French woman. Oozes elegance, and the bottle is just oh-my-god stunning.”\nSmells like: A floral boutique\nKey notes: Jasmine, rose essence, chypre accord\nWith ambassador Zendaya as its leading lady, Lancome’s Idole already has a lot going for it. But with its burst of fresh florals—rose and jasmine, in particular—this makes for a fully feminine, but never overpowering, scent.\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Beautiful scent of flowers that lasts on your clothes and wherever you spray it on yourself for well over a day! Plus, you only need a little bit, because it most certainly goes a long way.”\nSmells like: Spicy amber\nKey notes: Jasmine, saffron, cedarwood, ambergris accord \nBaccarat Rouge 540 is another woodsy scent with a sweeter edge. That first whiff is sweet, then it evolves into spicy, earthy notes of jasmine, cedar, and saffron.\n“This perfume is a guaranteed conversation starter. The distinct smell either evokes the response of 'Ahh, I love 540,' amongst knowing individuals or 'What is that smell?!' to those that are about to be introduced to the reigning king of the perfume occult. It seems more genderless at first spritz, but then dries down to a sweet, woody, sexy aroma.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nSmells like: Honeyed florals\nKey notes: Ylang ylang, Damascus rose, jasmine\nThere’s a reason you see this iconic bottle in practically every magazine you’ve ever opened. It’s a classic, and the fruity, floral ingredients never weigh down the luscious elegance of the ylang-ylang, jasmine, pear, melon, peach, and lily. \nA Sephora reviewer says: “Lovely floral scent, not too warm or heavy but still has good lasting power. Would recommended this to all ages and seems appropriate for both day and night. Gorgeous bottle.”\nSmells like: Early summer morning by a beach\nKey notes: Bergamot, pink pepper, primofiore lemon, neroli oil\nEven if you don’t live near the coast, this effervescent summer perfume will instantly transport to warm, sandy shores with notes of bergamot, coconut milk, and aquatic-inspired transluzone. Also, what’s not to love about its striking apothecary-style bottle? \nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Love this scent, takes me to holiday in my head in one spritz. All the best bits—sun cream, salty skin, fruity cocktails, and tropical flowers. Delicious. The scent really lasts well, too. Great for every day!”\nSmells like: Spicy florals\nKey notes: Black Coffee, white flowers, vanilla\nFor those who crave a little danger in their dress-up, this sexy concoction smelling of coffee, vanilla, and pear is a feast for the senses. A little smooth, a little edgy, this is a fantastic fragrance for evening wear.\nA Sephora reviewer says: “One of my favorite scents. Very mature but not like an old lady scent. It’s sophisticated and warm. I wear this year-round but suggest wearing it in the winter.”\nSmells like: First bloom of spring flowers\nKey notes: Bergamot, lychee, peach, jasmine, peony, orange blossom, moss, musk\nThis luxurious and fruity perfume is like summer in a bottle. Featuring unique traces of lychee, peony, orange blossom, and peach, with a little musk mixed in for good measure, this is like a well-made cocktail—worth the extra cost. \nA Saks Fifth Avenue reviewer says: “As a perfume hoarder, I can say that I have nothing like it in my collection, and it smells amazing! It’s a citrusy floral that settles in very beautifully.”\nSmells like: Fancy flowers\nKey notes: Calypso orchid, mandarin, Bulgarian rose, almond milk, ylang ylang, iris, white musks, sandalwood\nBuckle up tight because this fragrance takes you on a ride. The yin-yang scent composition unfurls a delicate composition of sensual citrus and florals, then comes the dip: warm almond milk, sandalwood, and white musk.\n“As someone with over 100 fragrances, my signature scent changes daily. However, I almost always begin most of my scent layers with Yin Transformation, which bursts with creamy florals that feel like a balmy spring morning.” — NP\nSmells like: Freshly squeeze berries over florals\nKey notes: Schisandra berry, mulberry, lily of the valley, plum blossom, honeysuckle, white amber, sandalwood, musk\nDrawing inspiration from the Korean word songari, which means an array of flowers or fruit on a single stem, this enticing fragrance is at once familiar and unexpected. Top notes of mulberry and Korea-native Schisandra berry open up to plum blossom and honeysuckle, followed by subtly grounding base notes of amber and sandalwood.\n“Elorea’s genderless perfumes are quickly becoming some of my new favorites. The burgeoning K-beauty brand looks to nature and its founders’ shared heritage to create some undeniably divine scents, like the soft yet not overly sweet Inflorescence. If you’re unsure which Elorea perfumes will best suit you, I also love that the label offers a discovery set, which comes with a voucher of equal value that can be applied to any purchase of a full-sized scent.”—Sam Peters, ELLE.com contributor\nSmells like: Fresh-out-of-water peonies\nKey notes: Black pepper, raspberry accord, peony accord, geranium, freesia accord, Turkish rose, patchouli, musk\nIf all you want for your birthday is a bushel of peonies, this perfume should be a runner-up. It’s a beautiful floral fragrance with notes of raspberry, geranium, Turkish rose, and peony. Basically a wearable bouquet.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “This is a lovely perfume with so many enticing scents–uplifting citrus, woodiness, and unusual florals. I found this to be really lovely, with good staying power.”\nSmells like: Spices and woods\nKey notes: Davana, tonka beans, coffee, labdanum, agarwood, sandalwood\nAnother fragrance that owes its influences to a city—in this case, bustling Mumbai—this perfume contains notes of davana, tonka bean, coffee, and sandalwood, to name a few. It’s a rich and slightly spicy perfume that’s perfect for the chilly winter months ahead.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “I generally find Byredo’s combinations to be impressive, unusual, and long-lasting. Mumbai Noise is no exception—it has terrific staying power. I love the woody and spicy notes, but it’s not too dark or heavy. The davana definitely lifts the blend! This is up there with my favorite, Bal d’Afrique!”\nSmells like: Sugary florals\nKey notes: Cattleya orchid, freesia, centifolia rose\nIt’s all in the name, folks: This perfume is like spritzing on the feeling of a sunset soirée in a romantic palace garden. With orchid, patchouli, tea leaf, jasmine and rose, wearing Flowerbomb is the next best thing to carrying a bouquet wherever you go.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Flowerbomb, in my opinion, has to be the most beautiful and comforting fragrance ever created. Sweet-soft-romantic-powdery. It’s heaven in a bottle.”\nSmells like: Luxurious after-shave\nKey notes: Peppermint, geranium, patchouli\nFor a slightly more masculine, aftershave-inspired perfume, this minty fragrance is fresh and delightful. Along with mint, it has notes of geranium and patchouli for a complicated but delectable fragrance. \nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Praise for this scent with not a single flower petal in sight. It makes me think of a classy wizard who relishes a good gin. It’s mystic and unusual, and I’m here for it.”\nSmells like: Dark, powdery fruits \nKey notes: blackcurrant, musk blonde wood\nA classic in the Armani collection, Sì is the ideal bottle for anyone pining for an earthy scent that doesn’t smell like, well, earth. With rose and freesia mellowing out this seductive fragrance, it’s a great transition perfume from day to evening.\n“When I heard rumors that this was Rihanna's original 'signature scent,' I had to try it. And now I see exactly why everyone says she smells so good. This perfume is the perfect scent to take you from summer into autumn.” — Danielle James \nSmells like: Peppery florals\nKey notes: Pink pepper, iris, ambrette\nThe whole point of this perfume is that it smells like the best version of you. That is, a you that showers with expensive body wash, and that inspires people to come up to you gushing, “What are you wearing?” It contains bright notes of pink pepper, warm amber, and a hint of fresh iris.\nA Glossier reviewer says: “I agree, it is a slightly more mature scent, but it’s such an elegant soft smell that I even put it on before bed and after showering. Definitely my new go-to. :) A few of my friends have bought it after smelling it on me at work. It’s such a unique but familiar scent at the same time. I love, love, love this perfume.”\nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

{"title": "17 Best Hair Thickening Products For Thin, Weak Hair", "date": "2023-09-30 22:39:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nMega volume and shine are just a spritz (or rinse) away.\nWe owe a big apology to our hair for all the stress we put it through, from constant hot styling to packing on heavy formulas, to frequent manipulation. That said, breakage, thinning, and dryness are inevitable. \nEvery story begins the same way: You notice your hair has been breaking off more than usual and immediately log on to Amazon to secure a bottle of the best hair growth vitamins or hair growth shampoos. Thankfully, there are several additional hair care treatments that encourage growth, give limp strands more volume, and fortify hair bonds to stop further breaking.\nBecause hair loss is such a sore spot and insecurity for many, the internet is brimming with products that make lofty promises to give you the luscious, full mane of your dreams. That's why we decided to help cut through the noise to find the ones that are actually worth your coins. We pored over dozens of customer feedback to find 17 of the top-reviewed hair thickening products that will blow you away.\nScalp care is the best care for restoring your hair. Vegamour's serum contains rich antioxidants to minimize breakage and shedding that leads to excessive hair loss.\nSize: 1 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.1/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I started with the brow serum and it worked so well that I had to try the serum for my thinning hair. I didn’t tell anyone that I was using it, but when my grandma told me that she wishes she had thick hair like mine I figured that was the best testimonial it could get, because I have never had thick hair! And I’m only 3/4 of the way through my first bottle! I’m truly grateful for this stuff!”\nTopical remedies can aid in hair restoration, but why not work directly at the source? Nutrafol's supplements are packed with a bevy of good-for-you vitamins to boost health and overall hair growth.\nSize: 120 capsules\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5 \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve used other top-of-the-line hair support products for 15 years but nothing compares to this. I’d lost almost 1/2 of my hair after covid and this made my hair grow back freaky fast and healthy! It’s super soft, shiny and thick again. I’m going to take this exclusively from now on & not bother with the others.”\nA TikTok fave, this serum from The Ordinary uses ingredients like Procapil (commonly used in hair growth products) and Baicapil to reboot hair density and increase blood flow in the scalp.\nSize: 2 oz\nSephora star rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I got this for my mom because she started losing her hair after local radiation and her hair has never looked better! She is so happy with it and her hairline is so much fuller now.”\nInstead of massaging a sticky serum into your hair, Oribe's Serene Scalp Thickening Hair Treatment is a spray formula that addresses hair thinning and loss from the root. The treatment conditions, nourishes, and restores with just a few sprays.\nSize: 4.2 fl oz \nSephora star rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I expected this to either make my hair greasy or frizzy. When it worked great the first time I expected it to just last one day max. Then I thought ‘I’m ok, it’ll just last from wash to wash; not be cumulative.’ But my hair was fuller even when you just washed & dried without using the spray. And my thin, fine, color treated hair loves it! If you’re thinking of trying it Definitely do! I Highly Recommend this spray!!”\nThis treatment is all about helping your hair, well, flourish. The lightweight formula restores balance and strengthens the hair from the scalp to promote regrowth.\nSize: 4 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I love this product for my thin hair! It gives some volume and it makes my hair look healthy! I use it every night, dry or wet and it doesn’t leave any grease unlike other thickening products. I also love the smell, it is light and fresh. I doesn’t irritate my scalp or make it drier. I just hope I can see changes for some hair growth, maybe if I continue to use it consistently.”\nYou've likely heard all of TikTok praise Mielle Organic's viral Rosemary Mint oil. Stimulating the scalp with a minty-fresh sensation, this oil softens and strengthens weak, brittle hair. \nSize: 2 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I recently lost my edges due to low iron and braiding. After bringing my blood level up, I wanted to try something to grow my hair back. Within 2 months I noticed a change in my edges. My hairline is fuller. This is a MUST buy. My edges were very thin and braiding them made it worse. But using this changed my hairline life. It leaves a soothing feeling.”\nSometimes, instant results are what you need. Nioxin's Styling Thickening Gel allows your hair to appear thicker no matter what style you choose. \nSize: 5.1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.3/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I've been using this product for almost 10 years, since the last time I transitioned back to natural waves. It mixes so well with curl products and other stylers, and it's good whether you leave your hair to air dry or heat style. It's so versatile and easy to use. Recommend!”\nLiving Proof makes it easy to fluff and volumize your hair instantly. This texture spray doesn't leave behind a crunchy mess and keeps the hair full of body and bounce.\nSize: 7.5 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.5/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “My all-time favorite. I’m on my 4th bottle and the bottle itself lasts forever. I have bleached processed hair (balayage) and curl it practically everyday. I’ve noticed such a difference when I stopped using it bc I ran out. People notice the volume. It doesn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel like it has residue.”\nThis powerhouse product detangles, softens, and hydrates the hair, among other things. The MVP of the formula is Emblica Technology, which plumps lifeless, dull strands and brings them back to life. \nSize: 6.7 fl oz\nUlts star rating: 4.2/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I have long hair down past my butt and it still gave my hair a good amount of lift and body. It is pretty darn pricey but already it works. It smells good and is easy to use. I'm going to try it again and curl my hair and see how it works with that.”\nHere's a shampoo that breaks down the gunk, oil, and dirt that threaten your hair daily to reveal refreshed, bouncy hair. Even better, it's safe for those with color, whether a bad DIY job or professionally treated. \nSize: 8.5 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I have thin, flat hair, tends toward greasy. This is a great shampoo for fullness and volume. Yes, you still need to style with volumizing products if you want major lift, but this is a great everyday (or every 3 days in my case) shampoo. It is not moisturizing — it is thickening. If you want moisture, use a moisturizing shampoo.”\nTreat your scalp to a boost of caffeine, ginger root, and arginine, all working together to build resistance and strengthen to prevent further breakage or shedding. \nSize: 3.04 fl oz\nSephora rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “This product has been amazing for me. I’ve noticed a lot less shedding and my hair feels stronger. My scalp feels great. I apply it at night before bed, and I haven’t noticed too much of a crunchy feeling or residue. I daresay that my roots look thicker with new growth! I’ve been using the system with shampoo, conditioner, and the blow dry primer. I’ve always struggled with fine hair, but lately my shedding and texture has been a concern. I highly recommend this serum!”\nIf your hair needs more shine, growth, and strength, and less breakage and thinning, the antidote could be found in this Amazon best-seller. Massage this scalp serum into your hair to boost moisture (not too much or it can get really oily) and manageability. \nSize: 4 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.2/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “So far this product is helping with my hair thinning around my face for hair loss. I have new hair growth coming up. Looking a lot better. Good product so far.”\nWhen your hair is already feeling lifeless, the last thing you need is heavy products weighing down your hair even more. Good thing this Kristin Ess spray has a lightweight formula that imparts shine and volumizes the hair, perfect for bombshell blowouts. \nSize: 8.45 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4.1/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Highly Recommend. I've used this for about 2 months now and I'm in Love. Works Great!! I will spray this in layers under my hair right before blow drying then using my diffuser high heat, low blow, pumps up my roots to give so much volume that lasts all day.”\nRestore your hair's density with this top-rated shampoo powered by biotin, rosemary, and aloe to stimulate the scalp and soften the hair.\nSize: 14 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I have an extremely sensitive scalp! Almost everything breaks me out. This has been a godsend. It has a pleasant scent, easy to use pump, and creates a decent amount of leather. The price is great too. I highly recommend this product for anyone that sugfers skin irritation.”\nThe key to a voluminous blowout Farrah Fawcett would be proud of is this volumizer by Color Wow. It doubles as a heat protectant, so you can apply it ahead of heat styling for big, bouncy curls. \nSize: 6.5 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I was pretty skeptical but this actually does work. Pleasantly surprised. Would recommend. A bit pricey but worth the splurge.”\nGive your scalp an intense treatment that fuses peppermint, tea tree oil, and vitamin b5 to stimulate the scalp and encourage growth.  \nSize: 4.23 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.7/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Thanks to age and medications my hair started to fall out more than normal. Thin, flat and weak looking was my new daily norm and I was devastated!! On a whim I decided to try the Intensive Spray and my hair is happy again!! After 2 weeks my hair looks full and I have a lot less breakage! It's a great option to have!”\nDefine curls, tame frizz, and add volume with just a few pumps of R+Co's Thickening Foam. This formula is made with a cocktail of vitamin E, fruit extracts, and aloe leaf for extra nourishment.\nSize: 5 oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.2/5\nWhat people are saying: “Gives so much volume to my thin curly hair.

{"title": "The 13 Best Keratin Shampoos for Stronger, Shinier Hair", "date": "2023-09-30 22:40:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe hair of your dreams awaits.\nIf frizz didn't exist, many of us would be happy campers. Sometimes, battling frizz can feel like a full-time job, especially when factors like humidity work against you, and buying a plethora of products to ward off frizz sometimes doesn't seem worth the trouble. Sure, the market is brimming with several quick fixes that can momentarily smooth down flyaways, like hair oils or leave-in conditioners. But odds are, if you’ve been battling frizz your whole life, you’ve heard something about keratin.\nKeratin treatments are an in-salon service that reduces frizz and adds shine to your hair; they can be pricey, and when done incorrectly, potentially damaging. However, whether you opt for a salon treatment or not, you can still get the smoothing, healing, and repairing benefits of keratin right in your shower. “If you’ve got frizzy locks and are afraid to take the leap and get a full-on keratin treatment at the salon, then a keratin shampoo is a great way to start,” says Clayton Hawkins, Los Angeles-based celebrity hairstylist who counts Olivia Rodrigo and Dove Cameron as clients. Ahead, find the 13 best keratin shampoos that can alleviate frizz.\nGetting a keratin treatment will make you feel like you're on top of the world. However, maintaining your treatment to prolong that feeling comes with work, specifically a proper at-home hair routine. Gussi's \"protection plan\" line was specifically designed to follow up the brand's own at-home keratin treatment. This shampoo adds sheen and fights frizz. \nSize: 8.1 fl oz \nSulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 3.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I can have the best of both worlds rocking nice curls or getting a smooth straight blow out without feeling like I’m severely damaging my hair. I was doubtful, but after 2 uses and being able to have frizz free days, I believe that this is very helpful and so much better than using products for permanent results. It was easy to use and really impressed with the results it delivers.”\nThe “morpo-keratine” technology in this product restores the flexibility of the hair to help create voluminous body with structure.\nSize: 8.5 fl. oz.\nSulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I started using this shampoo several months ago. My hair look healthier, shinier, and more alive. A bit pricey though but I'm happy with the outcome. It does work.”\nOne of Amazon’s top-reviewed shampoos, Purebiology’s RevivaHair Growth Stimulating & Anti Hair Loss formula, is packed with active ingredients to treat thinning or damaged hair. The natural extracts in the cleanser include biotin and keratin, which work in tandem to stimulate hair growth.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I purchased this at the recommendation of my hairstylist, who swears by it! The shampoo doesn't foam up as much as others, but I did notice a difference in my hair thickness and strength. Will continue to use, as hair turnover takes time to really see the full impact.”\nThis keratin-infused product prevents breakage and works to repair all the signs of heat damage. If you’re constantly using a flat iron or blow dryer, grab this to restore lost moisture and nutrients while in the shower.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “My hair regained luster; feels healthy and thicker!”\nHair damaged by heat or chemicals can reap the benefits of this shampoo which works overtime to repair and strengthen the hair.

Thanks to strand-thickening polymers in the formula, this volumizing shampoo not only makes the hair stronger but also increases its bounce factor. \nSize: 8.5 fl. oz\nSulfate-free: Yes\nSephora rating: 3.9/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “As someone with oily/greasy fine hair, this is the only shampoo that has kept it light and voluminous. I used to have to wash my hair every day, now I can go two or three days in between washes.”\nKeranique’s keratin amino complex reaches the cortex of the hair while strengthening the hair’s surface. After continued use, your hair should appear and feel fuller, thicker, and stronger.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Love this stuff! It's great for my thin hair.”\nThis Keratin Complex shampoo provides a gentle cleanse to color-treated hair. The product is formulated to soothe and protect against damage if you’ve been experimenting with dye. Double up and use the Keratin Complex conditioner from the same line to further hydrate and restore your hair’s protein.\nSize: 13.5 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: No\nUlta rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I love the way it cleanses my hair! Has it feeling refreshed, and softer.”\nPreviously, if you’ve had a Brazilian keratin treatment, there wasn’t a need to use a keratin-based shampoo or conditioner, but this product works with the treatment to maintain the health of your hair and leave it feeling full and healthy longer.\nSize: 13.5 fl. oz.\nSulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I wash my hair once a week and these products keep the frizz at bay the entire time. Even when it's raining or humid out…..NO FRIZZ! I highly recommend Pure Brazilian.”\nIf keratin alone isn’t enough to get your hair back on the road to good health, the extra oomph of super-moisturizing coconut oils will take you the distance. The other notable ingredient is avocado oils—you hear that, millennials?\nSize: 13 fl. oz.\nSulfate-free: No\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “This is my go-to rescue for my dry breaking hair. It really works.”\nThe keratin used in Virtue’s shampoo is identical to the keratin produced by the human body. This cleanser also works to rid strands of excess oil, dirt, and build-up in a gentle way that won’t damage or strip vibrancy from color-treated hair.\nSize: 8 fl. oz\nSulfate-free: Yes\nUlta rating: 4.7/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I have been using this for almost 2 years now and I have more hair than I have ever had in my life.”\nThis miracle worker in a bottle cleanses hair and restores shine while smoothing.

If you already have a keratin treatment, “Keratin shampoos help protect your investment by prolonging the smoothness of the cuticle,” says Perteet.\nEven if you have un-treated hair, keratin shampoos can still help keep frizz at bay. “If you have frizzy/coarse hair texture, keratin shampoo is a great option to help smooth your hair,” says Rasmussen. “Over time it creates a coating on the hair that will help fill in the pores in your hair to make it smooth and shiny.”\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

{"title": "The 10 Best Collagen Supplements for Hair Growth", "date": "2023-09-30 23:37:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nEager to have luscious locks? Look no further. \nThere’s nothing more upsetting than looking in the mirror and noticing sparse areas of hair on your scalp— dare we say bald spots. For those of you who have dealt with hair loss or hair thinning, you've probably gone down a rabbit hole of research, attempting to discover the best ways to restore your beloved strands. While desperately scouring the internet for answers, we're guessing that you came across a variety of hair growth shampoos and hair growth oils . And perhaps you found a thing or two about collagen.\nOn a basic level, collagen is one of the most abundant structural proteins found in the body. Composed of several types of amino acids, this powerful protein helps to promote skin elasticity, support muscular health, and encourage hair growth. “The most abundant amino acids in collagen are glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine, which are crucial for maintaining the health, elasticity, and strength of skin and hair,” says Dr. Dusan Sajic, board certified dermatologist. Thus, it comes as no surprise that many of us rely on collagen supplements to foster thriving hair.  \nConsuming collagen supplements can be a great after-the-fact solution, but it should also be considered as a preventative measure, especially as we get older.  “As we age, not only do we produce less collagen, we also lose excessive collagen due to environmental stressors like UV exposure, smoke exposure, and poor health habits,” says Shannon Augustine, board certified aesthetic nurse practitioner. But fear not, because luckily, there are plenty of collagen supplements that exist— from capsules to powders, and even liquids. Ahead, we’ve curated a list of the best collagen products for hair growth and we've also consulted medical and cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Dusan Sajic as well as aesthetic nurse practicioner Shannon Augustine, who have shared everything you need to know about collagen. \nVital Proteins’ formula is packed with hydrolyzed collagen peptides that help promote hair growth in addition to encouraging nail, bone, and joint health. Simply take a scoop of this powder and mix it into your favorite drink for your daily dose of collagen. \nType: Powder \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Paleo-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I noticed my hair was growing faster. I didn't measure it, but I feel convinced that I've experienced faster hair growth.”\nAnthony’s Collagen Peptide Powder is extracted from grass fed cattle,  which makes this blend rich in protein. And despite the fact that this collagen is animal-derived, Anthony’s formula is crafted without hormones, steroids, and antibiotics. \nType: Powder  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, pure hydrolysate\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.6/5 \nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve used this collagen consistently for a few years. I put it in my morning coffee or smoothies. My skin looks brighter and my hair is noticeably healthier.”— Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nAccording to Spoiled Child’s website, users reported stronger hair simply after 6 weeks of consuming the E27 Extra Strength Liquid Collagen on a regular basis.  For the best results, it's recommended to take one to two tablespoons a day.\nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen Peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, non-GMO\nSpoiled Child Rating:  4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “The mango flavor adds a little sweetness and kick to my morning smoothies. I love that it has hyaluronic acid—the hero ingredient in the Hailey Beiber Erewhon smoothie. Now I can have a hydrating smoothieat home for a fraction of the price.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nThese citrus flavored gummies are not formulated with any animal-derived ingredients, so they're perfect for those who are on a vegetarian or vegan diet.  In addition to collagen and biotin, these gummies are also infused with zinc, which is a crucial element regarding hair growth. \nType: Gummies  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, biotin, zinc\nCertified: Vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free\nSephora Rating: 5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve tried my fair share of skin, hair and nail gummies and these are my favorite. I’ve been trying to grow out my hair after bleaching it for a year and I needed all the help I could get. The best part is they taste great!”\nIf you love the taste of pomegranate, you won’t be able to resist NeoCell’s liquid collagen blend. Formulated with vitamin C, this nourishing mixture helps to strengthen hair strands.   \nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, vitamin C\nCertified: Gluten-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’m not losing hair like I have been for several years. So few hairs in the brush after one month of two tablespoons each night. It's thicker, as well.”\n Kourtney Kardashian is all about living a healthy lifestyle, so it comes as no surprise that she translates that same mindset into her brand, Lemme. Lemme’s biotin and collagen supplements come in the form of delicious gummies that are comprised of natural nutrients like biotin and zinc, which promote hair, skin, and nail health. \nType:  Gummies \nKey Ingredients: Grass-fed collagen peptides, biotin, vitamin C\nCertified: Non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, paraben-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.9/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I started using Lemme Glow on a whim, and it’s become a must-have in my beauty routine. It's made my skin smoother, and my hair and nails look healthier than ever.”\nIf you’re always on the go, it might be helpful to pop a bottle of collagen capsules into your purse. We highly recommend  Ancient Nutrition’s Collagen Peptide Pills as they’re great for rejuvenating various parts of your body including your hair, joints, and nails. \nType:  Capsules\nKey Ingredients: Bovine collagen, ashwagandha root and leaf extract, amla berry extract \nCertified: Non-GMO, keto friendly, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free\nRating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “Noticed results within a couple of weeks! My nails grew and weren’t brittle anymore, my hair was thicker and my skin is definitely looking and feeling better!”\nA few drops a day will keep the thin hair away. Raw Science’s liquid collagen and biotin drops help to generate healthy strands, especially for women who are struggling with hair loss. If you enjoy sipping on tea, try putting a few drops of this liquid mixture into a cup of lemon ginger tea for a tasty drink. \nType:  Liquid \nKey Ingredients: Biotin, bovine collagen peptides, vegetable glycerin, natural raspberry flavor \nCertified: Gluten-free\nLemme Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve been using this supplement for two years now. It definitely helps to grow your hair and nails out quickly. Easy to use.”\nThere are various kinds of collagen, and one of the most popular types is marine collagen. Marine collagen, extracted from fish, is specifically coveted for its ability to absorb more quickly into the body in comparison to bovine or porcine collagen. If you’re interested in trying out marine collagen, consider Amandean's  Marine Collagen Peptides which supports smooth hair and skin.\nType:  Powder\nKey Ingredients: Water hydrolyzed marine collagen, lime extract, aloe vera extract\nCertified: Gluten-free, soy-free, shellfish-free, keto friendly \nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “This collagen powder is great for hair and nail growth and joint pain. I have been taking it for 3 months and my arthritis pain is practically non existent. My hair is so thick and grows very fast.”\nFor those seeking a collagen blend packed with extra protein, look no further than Garden of Life’s Grass Fed Collagen Peptides Powder. With 18 grams of protein, this blend contributes to skin elasticity and healthy hair. \nType:  Powder\nKey Ingredients: Grass fed collagen peptides\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I can’t believe how much this Garden of Life collagen powder has improved my overall health. Not only does it promote healthy skin, hair, and nails, but it also provides proven joint mobility support.”\nDr. Sajic tells ELLE.com that collagen is a protein formulated with amino acids that provide structure, elasticity, and strength to both skin and hair. “Altogether around fifty-six percent or more of the amino acids in collagen are foundational for skin and hair proteins, and thus has a great ratio that will contribute directly to hair health and vitality,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while collagen can certainly help to solve some of your hair problems, maintaining a healthy diet is equally important. “Optimal hair health also requires a more comprehensive approach, including other proteins, vitamins, minerals, and care practices,” Dr. Sajic says. \nAlthough collagen is widely recognized for its ability to promote healthy hair and skin, this abundant protein also plays a crucial role in other bodily functions including joint health and bone health. “Collagen assists in maintaining the integrity of cartilage, which is essential for healthy joints, and it helps to maintain bone density, which is crucial for preventing age-related bone issues like osteoporosis,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nIf you’re looking to target these areas of your body, or simply interested in a supplement that provides a cohesive approach, it’s worth incorporating collagen supplements into your daily wellness routine. \nAlso to note, some collagen supplements are infused with additional nutrients that help to nourish the body. “Collagen supplements may also include vitamins like vitamin C, zinc, vitamin B, and omega-3s which further support your body and health,” Augustine says. \nSo, we’ve heard about all the wonderful benefits of collagen but are there any side effects? Dr. Sajic shares that although collagen is generally safe for most individuals, there are a few things to note. “Some may experience side effects like stomach discomfort, a bad taste or possible allergic reactions,” Dr. Sajic says. “It’s essential to choose high-quality collagen supplements and consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen,” he adds.\nTo avoid allergic reactions, or any added ingredients that might not sit well with your body, Augustine also suggests taking the time to thoroughly read the ingredient labels.  \n“You should always talk to your health care provider before taking any oral supplements or medications,” says Augustine. She also explains that consulting a healthcare professional is especially important if you are taking daily medications or have serious drug or food allergies.\nDr. Sajic shares that those with fish, pork, or bovine allergies should avoid collagen, as many collagen supplements are derived from these animal sources. “It’s also important to talk to your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease, as the excess protein may put extra stress on these organs,” he adds. \nCollagen supplements exist in many forms— including liquid, powder, and capsules— but they all have relatively equal effects. \"There are not enough non-bias studies to suggest that one is better than the other,” Augustine shares. \nAt the end of the day, it simply boils down to your personal preferences, lifestyle, and dietary restrictions. “Liquid collagen can be consumed directly or mixed into beverages, while powder can be added to smoothies, coffee, or baked goods,” Dr. Sajic says. If you would prefer not to mix collagen with your food or drink, you can always take a capsule. However, Dr. Sajic notes that depending on the capsule, it might not be absorbed as efficiently as other forms of collagen. \n“For most people, collagen should be taken once daily,” Dr. Sajic says. “Dosage can range from 2.5 to 15 grams daily, depending on the individual’s age, health, and specific skin or hair concerns.” And as with anything, patience and consistency is key, so make sure that you keep track of your collagen intake. “It may take several weeks, if not three to four months, for you to start noticing the benefits of collagen supplements,” Dr. Sajic adds.\nDr. Dusan Sajic is a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist, the director of the Derma Skin Institute, and the creator of  Sajic Skin.\nShannon Augustine, NP is a is a board certified nurse practitioner and self-proclaimed expert injector at  SkinSpirit.\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nCan you stop your stomach issues with a single capsule? \nWhen we think about bacteria, negative connotations often come to mind. But, not all bacteria is bad, and probiotics are the prime example of what health experts call good bacteria. “Probiotics are friendly, healthy, good-for-you bacteria that work to improve your health,” says Dr. Roshini Raj, a gastroenterologist, author, and founder of Tula Skincare. Most notably, probiotics can help to promote a healthy gut, but these essential microorganisms can also lead to clear skin, a high-performing immune system, and balanced pH levels (down there) for women. \nAs for how to ingest probiotics, it’s essential to note that they are naturally found in foods like greek yogurt, kombucha, and kimchi. However, depending on your diet, you might not consume enough probiotics on a daily basis. In that case, you might want to consider taking probiotic supplements. “When choosing a probiotic supplement, the first step is to look at the ingredients,” Dr. Raj advises. “You want powerful ingredients that are not only good for you but that will also be effective.”\nThere are an array of probiotic supplements that are formulated to target specific concerns, so the first step is to understand what exactly you need help with. For example, if you are experiencing digestive issues, the Cleveland Clinic suggests selecting a capsule that contains lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, bacillus or saccharomyces boulardii. We know these names sound extremely complicated, so it might also make sense to consult your doctor or a professional that could point you in the right direction.\nAccording to Dr. Raj, if you incorporate effective probiotic supplements into your diet, you should start to feel, and look, much healthier. “After my patients began probiotic treatments, I saw a significant improvement not only in their internal health but also in their appearance,\" says Dr. Raj. “Oftentimes their skin was calmer and clearer and I could tell they were feeling better before they had the chance to tell me.” But don’t just take Dr. Raj’s word, try it yourself! \nAhead, scroll through a list of the best probiotics to improve your overall health.  \nGarden of Life’s probiotics are crafted specifically for women  to support vaginal, digestive, and immune health. Their one-a-day capsules also lack most major allergens including dairy, soy, or gluten.\nType: Capsules \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.6/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I've been taking this women's probiotic for about 6 months and it has helped me so much and I will keep buying it every month. I give it 10/10.”\nThis symbiotic formula includes prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics which work to support gut health and immunity. The time-release capsule ensures the probiotics survive your digestive tract and make it to the colon, where they can thrive.\nType: Capsules\nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Vegan, non-GMO, gluten-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.2/5\nWhat reviewers are saying:  “Genuinely such an impressive little bottle of pre-, pro-, and postbiotics all in one.”\nIt tastes like a peach-flavored treat, but will actually help with digestion. On top of probiotics, this gummy also has fiber, which encourages your digestive tract to run smoothly.\nType: Gummy \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Gluten-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I started taking these a year ago as I had chronic diverticulitis flare-ups and someone recommended them to me. Ever since I began taking these, my intestinal tract has been working well regularly (sorry if this is TMI) and I have had NO flare-ups at all. I am so happy to not have the pain of diverticulitis and to not have to take the antibiotic treatments that make me nauseated! These gummies also taste delicious and it is hard to eat just one.”\nAnybody who has suffered through a single urinary tract infection never wants to repeat the situation—and these were formulated with that in mind. Also, these probiotics help to balance vaginal pH and bacteria so that you can avoid dreaded yeast infections, \nType: Capsule \nDosage: 2 daily \nCertified: Gluten-free, dairy free  \nTarget Rating: 4.9/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I went through a year of UTIs and this has helped to not only keep them at bay but make my overall health feel better.”\nThis dual-encapsulated probiotic has a super-high AFU count and has 24 different types of probiotics that cater to better digestion, skin, and cardiovascular health. This 2-in-1 capsule is also formulated with punicalagins, a key ingredient that is biotransformed by gut microbes into metabolites (molecules that aid in metabolic reactions for healthy cell growth).\nType: Capsules\nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Gluten-free, vegan, soy-free, nut-free, selfish-free \nWhat reviewers are saying: \"I've been a Seed stan since my first swallow—you have to ease into it (start with one capsule for a few weeks before you graduate to two), but my stomach has never felt better. And I definitely notice a difference when I switch to other brands.”\nFormulated by gastroenterologist and skincare brand founder, Tula’s probiotic is focused on giving you your best skin ever. More specifically, these capsules are infused with ceramides, which help to promote hydrated skin.  \nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free  \nTula Rating: 4.1/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"Just finishing my 30-day supply. My skin is clear and I’ve noticed some new hair growth. I haven’t noticed any changes as far as helping with bloating but will try it for another 30 days and see if I notice a difference.”\nHUM Nutrition is renowned for creating effective  supplements, and these potent Gut Instinct capsules are spiked with 10 strains of probiotics for better digestion and immunity. Clinical studies conducted by HUM proved that 90% of customers were satisfied after regularly consuming the Gut Instinct capsules.\nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Vegan  \nBlue Mercury Rating:: 4.7/5\nWhat reviewers are saying:  “I have taken other probiotics before and have not felt as comfortable in my gut as I do with Gut Instinct! I am more regular, have less bloating with eating and it does not irritate my stomach. I am thankful I found HUM Nutrition and will be trying more of their supplements soon!”\nPop two of these blackberry flavored gummies for a dosage of 3 billion CFUs and smoother digestion. All Lemme products are created with botanical blends that are completely vegan. \nType: Gummy \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan, gelatin-free  \nLemme Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying :\"I know what you're thinking—another Kardashian business, no thanks.

Klean’s probiotics were designed to do just that by supplying 15 billion beneficial live organisms. These probiotics are also completely free of artificial coloring and sweeteners, which is particularly important for those who wish to cultivate a balanced nutritional diet.\nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, wheat-free, soy-free  \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “Love this supplement! All of the good stuff and no icky extras. You get exactly what you need and can actually be absorbed by the body unlike the off brand stuff. As a group fitness instructor and health coach, I recommend it to all my clients.”\nIf you’re on a budget, NewRhythm Probiotics might just be for you.

{"title": "Spring 2024 Makeup Trends We Love from Fashion Week", "date": "2023-10-01 03:58:00", "text": "Fresh off the runway. \nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year—no, it’s not the holidays (yet); however, it is a fashion holiday: fashion month. And while you may be eyeing the celebs sitting front row or dreaming of your next outfit, the runway is the perfect place to discover what’s next in beauty. \nThis season, the crystal ball, er, runway, proved that even though we’re not masking up as frequently (rethink that: Covid cases are rising), eyes are a major focus and using color as a way of expression. Skin is in—with fresh faces and dewy skin taking priority on the runway. In fact, this season, many skincare brands, prepped models’ skin for the runway. After all, if you want great looking makeup, you must take care of its base: Your face. Brandon Maxwell leaned into a skin-focused beauty look, utilizing Noble Panacea products for a hydrated, fresh glow. \nDo you want to peek into the future to see what’s in store for 2024? Katie Jane Hughes, celebrity makeup artist and founder of KJH.brand whose clients include Hailey Bieber and Karlie Kloss as well as Kim Baker, celebrity makeup artist and founder of Glamazon Beauty divulge to ELLE.com all top Spring 2024 makeup trends, fresh off the runway!\nGraphic liner, floating eyeliner—whatever you want to call it, it’s a vibe and you will see it all Spring/Summer 2024. This graphic liner look on Paloma Elsesser at Eckhaus Latta gives a butterfly wing effect and plays up her high cheekbones. \n“I love how a graphic eye can be an accessory to your look,” shares Katie Jane Hughes in response to the Jil Sander show at Milan Fashion Week.\nCelebrity makeup artist and Lancôme Global International Makeup Artist Sheika Dailey took us to the year 3000 with this futuristic cat eye. Playing with negative space and floating lines in the inner eye, ups the sex appeal of this sultry look. “It’s editorial yet still super wearable and sexy,” says Hughes. You can read more about the look, here.\n“I predict that the Spring/Summer ’24 makeup trends are going to be all about vibrant, bold, color eyeliners,” shares Glamazon Beauty founder and celebrity makeup artist Kim Baker. Curious as to which colors? Baker says, “Eyeliner in bold over the top shades such as Periwinkle, royal blue, vibrant red, and shocking pink” will be all over the lids of trendsetters and beauty girlies next spring.\nHughes also agrees that color eyeliner is a big Spring/Summer ’24 trend. “I love how they matched the eye look to the fashion at Helmut Lang,” says Hughes. “In 2024, the vibrant color lined eye will dominate the street and our makeup bag,” adds Baker.\nDon’t have colored eyeliner? You can fake it with eyeshadow. “We saw royal blue being used at shows such as Altier Ndigo. Makeup artist T. Cooper used the shade ‘Oshun’ featured in the Supreme Being Palette by Glamazon Beauty to create a killer eye look that works for runway to real-way,” says Baker.\nFor Spring/Summer ’24, imperfection is perfection. And while we normally see this trend with the hair, this season, it’s visible with makeup in a bold, bright way. The mismatched eyeshadow seen at Chopova Lowena was a favorite for Hughes. She shares, “I think this is a really cool and fresh take on how to do eyeshadow that is unusual and out of the box.”\nAt Phillip Lim 3.1, this neon, one shadow look plays up negative space in opposite accords.\n“The look I kept seeing across the board was glowing skin. Everyone had dewy, glowing skin and I can’t think of a better feature to play up for Spring and Summer,” says Baker. At Retrofete, it was all about sexy, glowy, and hydrated skin. Elyse Reneau, Executive Director of Global Beauty at Too Faced states, “Humidity has never looked so sculpted!” \nAt Altuzurra, celebrity makeup artist Diane Kendal showcased her famous “flawless face” technique that she developed early in her career. It focuses on making skin look as radiant and perfect as possible, using minimal makeup.\nMermaidcore gets an update for Spring/Summer ’24. At Sandy Liang, rhinestones were placed haphazardly around the eyes to mimic barnacles. Into this look? You can read our full take on it, here.\nMermaidcore is more than just rhinestones and shades of blue and green. Jason Wu’s interpretation highlights healthy skin. “Inspired by Jason’s vision of experiencing rebirth after a shipwreck, we crafted a cohesive makeup look that exuded a dewy, aquatic allure,” shares Kendal, who was the Lead Makeup Artist. Wu’s Kindness For Your Lips Lip Oil was applied on the high cheekbones for a luminous glow.\nIf a sensual siren decided to attend a rave, this look is how I envision their makeup. The amalgamation of blue, green, and yellow mimics underwater coral reefs and is a festival of color for the eyes. Somewhere, somehow, I think Ariel would approve. \nDanielle James is the Digital Beauty Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "The 25 Best ‘Sex and the City’ Guest Stars", "date": "2023-10-01 04:00:00", "text": "I couldn't help but wonder, who hasn't been on SATC?\nFor six seasons, Sex and the City was a revolving door for actors and actresses who were either fans of the show, friends of the show, or up-and-comers who just wanted to be part of the action. Some played versions of themselves (Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu), while others were barely recognizable (a young Kat Dennings, Andy Cohen). Here, a look back at some of the famous faces who crossed paths with Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte over the years.\nAll episodes are available to stream on Max\nJack (Bradley Cooper) was bad news from the beginning. As Carrie says in the episode, \"They Shoot Single People, Don't They?\" Jack was everything she needed at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday at a gay bar: single, straight, smoker. It could've been the greasy hair, the tempting smoking habit (she was trying really hard to quit), or the fact that Jack later discovered Carrie's \"Single & Fabulous?\" New York Magazine cover story — the two never did anything more than make out in a crowded bar and briefly, in his convertible. \nIn “The Perfect Present,” Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda head to a purse party thrown by the recently dumped Vanessa, played by the queen of the bend-and-snap. “Isn’t life funny? Because of that fucker, I’ve discovered, I’m Fendi!” she says in the episode, moments before walking into Samantha and Smith (in his pre-Gus Van Sant days) boning against several glass racks. \nGeri Halliwell played Phoebe, someone Samantha runs into on one of the hottest days of the summer. While fanning herself, Samantha learns (via Phoebe) that the pool at Soho House is the place to be, that is, if you can get past the waiting list. Enter: Annabelle Bronstein, whose membership card Samantha finds in the bathroom and uses a few times before her jig is up.\nBetween the end of The X-Files (the OG run) and the beginning of Californication, David Duchovny guest starred on several TV shows including Sex and the City. He played Jeremy, Carrie’s high school boyfriend (sorry, \"sweetheart\") who completely sweeps her off her feet before revealing he’s starting treatment at a mental institution in Connecticut. Here he is welcoming Carrie to the Juneau Spears Center, a place harder to get into (and out) of than the Soho House.\nJustin Theroux had the distinct honor of guest starring on SATC twice. On the season one episode, “The Monogamists,” Justin played Jared, a writer friend of Stanford’s who had a thing for giving the thumbs-up and was named one of  New York Magazine’s “30 Coolest People Under 30.” His character didn’t venture too far in the occupation department the second time around; on the season two episode “Shortcomings,” Justin played Vaughn, a fiction writer who orgasms too fast (hence, the episode’s title). \nIn the same episode where Samantha famously said, “I don’t believe in the Republican party or the Democratic party; I believe in parties,” Elizabeth Banks checked off one of her very first TV roles. In “Politically Erect,” Elizabeth played Catherine, the pearl-wearing fiancée of a politician Charlotte had set her eyes on at a fundraiser. According to Catherine, she met Bob, the fiancée, at a party where women brought guys they didn't want to date, leading a martini-filled Charlotte to mumble something about one women's trash becoming another's treasure.\nJohn Slattery played politician Bill Kelley, who was running for city treasurer and famously told Carrie, \"I love making love with you,\" before asking her to pee on him in the shower. When Carrie offered to \"dribble warm tea\" on him instead, Bill dumped her, citing that his campaign advisors didn't like her sex column. This of course, led Carrie to write a bit called, \"To Pee or Not To Pee?\" without using his real name. \"It was much more political not to,\" she said on the episode.\nReason #2409 why you should never date someone you meet at your therapist’s office: Seth, played by Jon Bon Jovi in “Games People Play.” In the episode, Seth takes Carrie out to dinner, plays a sexy game of Twister, and tells her he’s in therapy because he’s “really fucked up about women… after I sleep with them I lose interest” — after sleeping with Carrie.\nRemember when Samantha used Lucy Liu’s name for a Birkin bag that had a 5-year waiting list? On “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,” Samantha committed this very crime – a travesty in the PR world – and got caught by Lucy, who played herself on the episode.\nIn the L.A.-set episode, appropriately titled \"Escape From New York,\" SMG played Debbie, the \"most ambitious and feared creature,\" according to Carrie. Debbie was a junior development executive who really, really wanted to make a movie out of Carrie's columns. She also predicted that the movie would be \"chick flick big\" before declaring that the man who came up with that term \"should have his balls cut off.\"\nIn the same L.A. episode as SMG, Matthew McConaughey played a hyper version of himself who was interested in Carrie's movie and her columns. In a cringe-worthy business meeting, the SATC version of Matthew declared that he wanted to play Mr. Big and sleep with Carrie, all while biting on a toothpick. \"We are animals, men, women, walking the earth,\" he said in this scene. \"We are made of head, heart, and loins. We're talking about using them, am I right?\" Nah. Carrie was good, which is why she GTFO of there.\n\nBefore she was Bailey on Grey’s Anatomy, Chandra Wilson played a cop who confronted Samantha about her Richard “CHEATER” posters in the episode titled \"Anchors Away.\" When Samantha explained, “This man said he loved me, and I caught him eating another woman’s pussy,” the extremely understanding cop backed off in full support of this public shaming.\nCarrie’s columns never did turn into a movie, but they did turn into a book thanks to the brains of Lily Martin, book agent, played by Molly Shannon. Together with Courtney Masterson (Amy Sedaris; see next slide), Lily transformed Carrie's words  into something with a spine. At their first meeting, Lily got right to the point: “Is it hopeful? What's the message? What’s your point of view, after all the break ups and disappointments and train wrecks? You still believe he’s out there, right?” That gasp you heard? Millions of people asking why after all these years, Lily still knows what they’re thinking. \nWhen she was not finishing Lily’s sentences, Courtney (Amy Sedaris) was busy introducing future lovers to each other. Case in point: Carrie and Berger, who met while Carrie was in a book meeting with Courtney at her office. Hard to believe this relationship eventually ended with a Post-it note by way of The Hamptons, motorcycle rides, and a white noise machine that only took Carrie to the rainforest.\nBefore he was Tag on Friends, Eddie Cahill played Sean, Carrie’s bisexual “generation-something else” fling that she met at a party celebrating his “internet magazine… that I still couldn’t find on my computer.” Carrie Bradshaw and her internet talk! Despite the fact that they had a great time on her ice skating date (she smoked and drank on the ice like a rebellious young!) Carrie was not prepared for where he took her to next: a party attended by the next SATC guest star on this list...\n... Alanis! On \"Boy, Girl, Boy Girl..\" the Canadian singer played Dawn, who kisses Carrie in a game of spin the bottle. Following the experience, which \"wasn't bad, kind of like chicken,\" Carrie went home and confirmed that she was indeed  \"too old to play this game.\" Other than Carrie's giant flower brooch (which of course got an update in one of the movies), this kiss was a shining moment for the episode.\nTo give back, Charlotte volunteered to be a guide for the blind on season six. Part of her training required walking in public with a mask and a guide to experience what the blind experience. Enter: Carrie, who fails miserably as Charlotte's guide. I guess this is why you shouldn't perform these training exercises at a Barneys, especially with stellar shoe salesmen like this one, played by SJP's real-life BFF Andy Cohen, around.\nThere was no one better than Kat Dennings for the role of Jenny Brier, a bratty, lip-gloss wearing 13-year-old who asks Samantha to plan her Bat Mitzvah on season three. When Samantha hesitates, Jenny name drops Carson Daly and \"The Clintons\" (who \"of course can't make it\") before casually revealing her bank account: \"We'd be lucky if we can swing this for under a mil.\" To which Samantha responds, \"We'll never get *NSYNC.\"\nOn an episode titled \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" Samantha has a fling with Adam, a director who has well, funky spunk. When he says she's just trying to avoid blowjobs and that they're \"easy,\" Samantha, arguably the best sex-ed teacher (and life coach) on TV, launches into one of the most memorable SATC speeches: \"I love giving head. Easy? You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there. Teeth placement, jaw stress, suction, gag reflex, all the while bobbing up and down trying to breathe through our noses. Easy? Honey, they don't call it a job for nothing.\" Mic. Drop.\nOn season four, Margaret Cho played Lynne, a fashion show producer who recruits Carrie to walk in a show that features New Yorkers and models alike. “No one is more New York or has more style than you,” she says on the episode, “The Real Me.” When Carrie hesitates, Lynne delivers another convincing command: “You’re fucking doing my show. If I have to hunt you down, skin you alive, and have one of the models fucking wear you.” The only problem with this character was that there was not enough of her. Imagine her having a showdown with Samantha?\nPeggy is Cosmopolitan.com’s entertainment writer, specializing in Leonardo DiCaprio, This Is Us, and the royals.

{"title": "Gemini Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:05", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(May 21 - June 20)\nReady to add some spice to your fall escapades, Gemini? After a challenging three months—with love planet Venus AND your ruler, Mercury, both in signal-scrambling retrograde—you should finally start to feel back on your game. Your jokes will earn cackles instead of cancellations, and your fans will stop being impervious to your charms. Now that’s more like it!\nEnjoy this lift while the Sun is in Libra and your fifth house of passion, fame and magnetism through October 23, amplified by energizer Mars, which is in Libra until October 12. It may be cuffing season, but you probably won’t want to be tied to any one person when there are so many enticing choices.\nIn the second half of October, eclipse season gets underway. The year’s last two game-changing lunar events arrive on October 14 and 28. The first one, a Libra solar eclipse, happens at the October 14 new moon. This could bring a romantic connection or a creative opportunity, perhaps even some fame, when you least expect it.\nYour spiritual life is in the spotlight at the October 28 lunar eclipse in Taurus and your twelfth house of surrender and serendipity. It’s time to let go of something you’ve been trying to control or desperately hold onto. This is the grand finale of a two-year Taurus/Scorpio eclipse series that’s rippled across your health, wellness and soul sectors since November 2021.\nWith so much to process, you may actually feel relieved that all five of the slow-moving outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto—are retrograde this whole month. The only exception is Pluto, which will turn direct (forward) in Capricorn and your deep-diving eighth house on October 10. Use this modulated pace to process all the changes from this year and get yourself centered. Eclipse season is bound to deliver its share of surprises.\nScorpio season will also lend a helping hand. As the Sun spends a month in your orderly and clear-thinking sixth house starting October 23, you can break things down into bite-sized manageable steps. That long list seems a lot less daunting when you tackle it a piece at a time.\nOn the shiny-happy side of things, the Sun is making its annual visit to Libra and your pleasure-seeking, playful fifth house until October 23. A touch of “fall fever” could overtake you as el Sol gives the frisky side of your Gemini nature cosmic permission to roam free. \nThe leaves won’t be the only things putting their fiery colors on display! Sizzling Mars is also in Libra until October 12, adding a dash of drama and sending your charisma off the charts. During these glamorous and giddy three weeks, you’ll be the life of every party as you hold court and build your fanbase. It’s is also a richly creative time, with the Sun warming up this expressive zone of your chart. Share your talents and nurture your artistic abilities. When the Sun is in this be-here-now zone, your best bet is to immerse yourself fully in the moment…your most direct path to joy.\nWatch for challenging fireworks on October 8, when Mars locks into a heated square with power-tripping Pluto, which is in your eighth house of intimacy and control. A fast-moving attraction could be stalled by your unwillingness (or theirs) to get truly vulnerable. Surrender is required at a certain point—but how soon is too soon? Some old trust issues could flare up. \nBefore you just react to those raw emotions, which you’ll be tempted to do under this powder-keg transit, look inward at what’s really driving up your fears or resistance. Don’t slam the drawbridge on a budding connection before you do! On the flip side, if you’re obsessing over someone, the Mars-Pluto square could spin you into tunnel vision if you’re not careful. Much as you’d like to control this situation, Gemini, people resent being micromanaged. YOU certainly do!\nAnd if that weren’t enough, there’s a whole lot more activation energy afoot as Pluto, the planet all things hidden, makes its presence again after a five-month retrograde. Since May 1, Pluto’s been back-spinning through Aquarius and your visionary ninth house (until June 11), then Capricorn and your zone of merging, intimacy and shared possessions. \nOver the summer and early fall, you may have done some deep soul-searching and released turbulent emotions, like shame, resentment and codependence. Pluto’s retrograde might also have revealed fissures in your closest relationships. An ex could have resurfaced, driving up jealousy or suppressed desires. Button-pushing people may have acted as “mirrors” who reflected something you needed to examine within yourself. Anyone that you’re in a financial, emotional or sexual entanglement with could have been the source of a power struggle.\nIf you happen to have buried any feelings (retrogrades can cause us to suppress and avoid certain emotions), Pluto’s pivot back to forward motion could drive them up once again. Have you been unsure whether to trust someone or get financially entwined? Clarity could arrive over the next couple weeks. Aim to be more aboveboard with the people in your life. \nOn October 14, the year’s only Libra new moon arrives, awakening your fifth house of passion, pleasure and expression. Even better? This one is a potent solar eclipse, the very first one to make landfall in Libra since 2016. \nThe eclipse could also bring love out of the blue! It will set off a six-month cycle that draws you out of your head (the Gemini “safety zone”) and helps you drop into your heart a little more. See what happens if you allow your emotions to roam free instead of trying to manage them. Your life could start to feel richer and more alive! Think: less control, more “carpe diem.”\nEclipses can bring surprises and sudden plot twists. In your fertile fifth house, this could bring unexpected baby news to Geminis of the childbearing set. Others might birth an amazing creative idea. This eclipse will prod you onto center stage, whether that means getting glam new headshots, booking a performance or just sharing more openly without caring about what anyone thinks.\nDon’t worry, you don’t have to make this change all at once. Between now and March 2025, eclipses will travel over the Aries/Libra axis, pushing you to be a bigger star AND a great team player. Today is a spotlight moment for you, Gemini. Step into that beam and let your personality rip. Don’t overthink it!\nAnd…cut! Fall friskiness and flamboyance give way to cleaner, greener days as the Sun moves into Scorpio and activates your sixth house of efficiency and wellness for a month. Get ready to turn over a new leaf amid the turning leaves. Before the holiday hedonism kicks into gear, use these coming four weeks to start some healthy habits and regular routines around eating, sleeping and exercise. With energizer Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, you’ve got an added dose of motivation. Start wherever you are—the key is to get going and let the momentum build.\nLet’s face it: You are far more productive when you get a full night’s sleep, incorporate regular exercise in your lifestyle and eat your dark leafy greens. Sure, you can sneak in a little Halloween candy, but you’ll feel so much better if you also harvest recipes for healthy, anti-inflammatory and plant-based treats. Aim for moderation now, instead of extremes. \nThe sixth house rules helpful people, service and systems. Scorpio season is a great time to corral any chaos at work or home with a deep clean and decluttering, especially with Mars putting the wind in your sails. Take inventory of Team Gemini and make sure everyone’s feeling clear and connected. Tweak plans for the rest of the year and set a couple of ambitious “stretch goals” for between now and Black Friday. \nGet ready…the last eclipse of 2023 will arrive just a few days shy of Halloween. It’s also the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021, reshaping your approach to health, healing, work and wellbeing. \nOn October 28, the annual Taurus full moon, a partial lunar eclipse, floods your twelfth house of healing and closure with its “let it go” prompts. Is it time to release someone or something, Gemini? If you’re hanging on to a person, situation or behavior that just isn’t giving you life anymore, it’s time to radically redirect those tides. \nYou might literally walk away, sure, but leaving isn’t always the answer. As the saying goes, “Wherever you go, there you are.” Maybe a better focus would be to try to transform the situation by NOT trying to control, micromanage or save it. This full moon could be a powerful portal for a spiritual message—don’t dismiss any strong intuitive flashes or inner guidance! An escape, preferably near water, could reset you and help you download some divine inspiration. \nLook back to the May 19 Taurus new moon for clues of what could come to fruition now. Where do you need support, including spiritual and emotional? This lunar eclipse is about receiving. Lean on your tried-and-true champions or seek new ones, such as a therapist or healer.\nIn sync with the lunar eclipse, lucky Jupiter in Taurus will oppose combative Mars in Scorpio. As you grow and expand in new directions, you may feel increasing stress from the people in your life. Their demands and needs could be at odds with your own need for greater independence. At this eclipse, you’re encouraged to fully use your voice and self-advocate, Bull. If you don’t have the capacity to take care of others now, simply let them now instead of getting angry or rebellious. Remember: “No” is a complete sentence!\nThe first week of the month is a social one, as Venus rounds out a four-month visit to Leo and your chatty, interactive third house. The other love planet, spicy Mars, is in Libra and your passionate fifth house until October 12. A fall fling or some epic date nights could start the month of right. On October 14, the Libra solar eclipse could bring a brand-new chapter to your love story, with someone new or the person you’re with.\nOn October 8, Venus ends a long visit to Leo that began on June 5 and included a challenging retrograde from July 22 to September 3. Now, the love planet moves on to Virgo, activating your fourth house of home, family and emotional foundations until November 8. \nWith tender Venus ensconced in Virgo, you’ll feel the magnetic pull of Chez Virgo and a desire to spend more time around your closest people. If you’re in a relationship, you might want to zip yourselves into your couple bubble and not emerge till after Thanksgiving! While you’re in there, share a few vulnerable confessions and be receptive to theirs.  \nIf you live with your S.O., you might be inspired to refeather your shared nest, whether it’s with a major home-improvement project or just some decorating changes. Single Geminis might need to pry yourselves out of the house and into some good mingling settings. Grab a chatty wingperson to keep you from bailing or sneaking off early.\nMeanwhile, over in your passionate fifth house, lusty Mars is stoking your libido as it makes its biennial blaze through Libra and your pleasure sector until October 12. Whether you’re single or attached, the first half of the month grants you head-turning magnetism and major mojo—plus, plenty of options to choose from, especially at the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. \nMake the most of this glamorous cycle by dressing up and enjoying all the attention you effortlessly attract. For some Twins, a casual flirtation could heat up to full consummation. (Note: This could come with a side of drama since Mars can drive up jealousy and competitiveness.) Longtime couples will enjoy these sizzling vibes, which, P.S., also shed ideal babymaking mood lighting if you’re of that mindset!\nOnce lusty Mars zips into Scorpio on October 12, you’re lit with motivational energy until November 24. Surprise: You’ll be as pumped about spreadsheets as you are about Spin class. Before you shoot for the moon, though, make sure your tanks are filled with rocket fuel (read: clean, vitamin-rich food and enough cash to pull off the plan). Single Geminis could meet someone while engaged in healthy pursuits. Paired-up Twins can get closer by tackling a shared project or fitness goal. The magic is in the mundane!\nTurn your passion into profits! With activator Mars in Libra and your creative, spotlight-grabbing fifth house until October 12, one of your talents could take hold of public attention. You’re one of the most creative and naturally entertaining signs, so it won’t be surprising when you capture the attention of a fascinated (and fascinating) fanbase. The October 14 Libra solar (new moon) eclipse is an especially fortunate date to put your bolder ideas into the public sphere.\nWhen Mars moves into Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, you’re ready to bring the sharp edges back to your life. Scorpio rules your sixth house of systems, order and helpful people. You may need to corral Team Gemini into shape—or, if you’re a party of one, start delegating and outsourcing tasks that have become procrastination points for you. Instead of DIY-ing, find a capable specialist who can knock it out in a few hours. It will be well worth the investment, even if it doesn’t seem like it at first. \nMars in Scorpio is a motivating time to organize and declutter before the holidays begin.

{"title": "Taurus Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:05", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(April 20 - May 20)\nDid back-to-school season get off to a slow start, Taurus? Fear not! You’re actually right in sync with the stars. For the first three weeks of the month, the Sun is in Libra and your systematic, sensible sixth house. Energizer Mars is also riding through Libra in tandem until October 12, fueling your resolve to get healthy and organized.\nIt also happens to be eclipse season as the two final lunar events arrive on October 14 and 28. The first one, a Libra solar eclipse, comes at the October 14 new moon to really boost up your work and wellness efforts. Then, the grand finale of a two-year Taurus/Scorpio eclipse series finishes off the month. Brace yourself, Bull: The October 28 lunar eclipse is in YOUR sign and will bring all of the personal growth work you’ve done since November 2021 together with a flourish.\nThis “uncorking” will be a welcome change after a sluggish summer. Although all five of the slow-moving outer planets will be retrograde (backward) this month, that trend starts to reach an end.\nOn October 10, alchemical Pluto will end a five-month retrograde that began on May 1, splitting its time in Aquarius (until June 11) and Capricorn. Pluto’s reversal made you deeply rethink your career and what inspires you. As Pluto emerges from this season of soul-searching, you’ll have a chance to explore how to add some soul to your goals.\nPartnerships take center stage starting October 23, when the Sun dives into Scorpio and your relationship sector for a month. Explore those ties that have dynamic-duo potential, but wait until that big Taurus eclipse on October 28 to make any binding decisions.\nEclipses are famous for bringing curveballs and surprises, or at least for revealing hidden information. Whether it’s a trick or a treat, it could take until Halloween before you can really see the whole picture. Give the energy a few days to settle—some new information could be revealed. As a steady Taurus, you understand the power of waiting and collecting ALL of your options before making a decision. Follow those natural instincts now!\nReady to bring those crisp edges back, Taurus? The stars are lined up to support your efforts this month, whether you’re doing a deep clean and declutter, mapping out a project plan or starting healthy habits. With the Sun in Libra and your sixth house of well-being and organization until October 23, it’s time to prioritize the practical. \nVirgo season, which ended on September 23, is typically an indulgent time for you. If you tipped too far into hedonism, the Libra Sun helps you return to balanced living. Think: consistent mealtimes, movement and sleeping hours. To power up your efficiency efforts, energizer Mars is making its biennial visit to Libra until October 12. You’re ready to tackle whatever “problem spot” you set your sights on—and to be as proactive and solution-oriented as possible. \nMars in Libra can also rev you up to get a fall fitness plan underway. But be sure to stretch your muscles and warm up before workouts. The hasty red planet can make you accident-prone and susceptible to strains or injury. Monitor your stress levels to keep your health in check now too. \nOne day that could find you racked with indecision—and stressed about it—is October 8, when anxious Mars locks into a high-pressure square with power-tripping Pluto. \nMars is in Libra and your analytical sixth house, which could drive up anxiety and make you feel overwhelmed by all the details. Pluto in your expansive ninth house can serve up big schemes and dreams. But putting an actual plan in place, which is usually a Taurus specialty, might fall apart. Your inner control freak will want to micromanage the process—or your mind will spin through all the reasons “this can’t work.” \nIs this a fear of success…or of failure? Maybe both. Either way, don’t let the intensity get the best of you. Examine the concerns that arise and conduct due diligence. But don’t empower the intense fear or emotion behind those factors.\nAs Pluto powers forward in Capricorn and your ninth house of higher education until January, you might consider returning to school. Don’t rush into any major degree programs, Bull. More likely, this transit could draw you into a course or workshop on a specific topic, perhaps even something related to personal growth and transformation. \nSometimes you have to dive deep to excavate your purpose—and bottomless Pluto will happily pull you into those recesses. With expansive Jupiter and changemaker Uranus both in Taurus (but retrograde) for a long stretch, self-realization work could unearth a treasure! It won’t be an overnight process, but it’s one well worth exploring. Follow your curiosity!\nThe Libra new moon on October 14 is a solar eclipse, making it particularly auspicious for starting a new habit, work project or wellness practice. With holiday hedonism on the horizon, regular exercise and clean eating will help balance out the impending temptations that will be way too good to resist. Want to get more in tune with the rhythms of your spending patterns, health and time management? There’s an app for that; install a few! \nThe sixth house rules service, so look for volunteer opportunities or initiate a giving drive at work. Bonus points if you round up a few friends and turn your do-gooding into a social occasion. Since pets also fall under this new moon’s domain, pay attention to the unconditionally loving critters in your life. If you’re thinking of adopting, start your search. \nThis new moon will sit opposite wounded warrior Chiron in Aries and your twelfth house of closure. Are you still holding onto past pain or feeling like life is somehow stacked against you? Even if it’s an unconscious pattern (and it probably is), this eclipse—and the ensuing eclipses on the Aries/Libra axis touching down until March 2025—are taking you through an important healing cycle. Get support when it feels like you’re falling apart instead of pretending you’ve got it all together. There are no awards being handed out for perfectionists and martyrs, especially not now!\nIf the eclipse’s messaging wasn’t loud enough, the universe sends out another call for you to lean on the people in your life. On October 23, the Sun enters Scorpio and your zone of dynamic duos for a month. Forget about using that old “I’ll just do it all myself!” strategy. The stars will insist that you encircle yourself with a few true-blue souls who have your back through it all. \nMotivator Mars is also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, making your Scorpio season duos extra dynamic. You could attract some powerful and charismatic people now. This sizzling Sun-Mars combo could add an extra dash of spice to your love life, but it could also multiply the stress. \nIf you feel pressured to give someone an answer, whether in love or business, tap the brakes. We’re not saying you should downshift to an overly cautious pace. Just buy yourself enough time to think any important moves through clearly. If you’re the one rushing someone into a decision, calm down so you don’t scare them away. \nThe lunar loudspeaker is blaring your name on October 28 as the year’s only Taurus full moon arrives to turn your birthday wishes into reality. This one is extra-special because it’s also a lunar eclipse, which will cast its brightest beams on your first house of self and independence. Not only that, it’s the grand finale of a two-year eclipse series that’s thundered across the Taurus/Scorpio axis, revolutionizing your personal identity and your relationships. \nYou’re not the same person as you were in November 2021, when these change-making eclipses began to work their magic. And that’s the point! Hopefully you’ve shed some inauthentic layers and become more of yourself. If you did, you undoubtedly found people who aligned with that. Some of your relationships may have dramatically changed, a few ending or transforming. Not only is that natural, it was the point of these eclipses. \nYour meteoric growth is far from ending, though. Expansive Jupiter will continue its journey through Taurus all the way through late May 2024. Today, you might get a boldfaced look at how much you’re grown as Jupiter opposes Mars in Scorpio and your interpersonal house. A close relationship could reach a tipping point—or a breaking point. You can’t tamp down your truth to keep the peace anymore, Bull. At the same time, make sure you’re not being confrontational or pushy in an effort to get others on board with your vision. This eclipse, along with the Mars-Jupiter opposition, gives you one last big chance to refine both your messaging and your delivery.\nBack on track for cuffing season! Your ruling planet Venus has been a tricky one for the past few months. Venus took an extended trip through Leo and your heartfelt, homey fourth house from June 5, one that will end on October 8. That would be lovely, except Venus also spent six of those weeks (from July 22 until September 3) in low-power retrograde, disrupting the harmony of your closest bonds.\nWell, it’s time for a do-over, Taurus! On October 8, amorous Venus sashays through Virgo and your flirtatious, flamboyant fifth house. Between now and November 8, love is in the air as much as the scent of pumpkin-scented everything. Whether you’re single or attached, you’ll be in the mood to dress up, turn heads and pack your calendar with events. Unattached Lions may not want anything too serious during this cycle, especially since you could have lots of admiring options. Be upfront about your intentions (or lack thereof)—but prepare to have your heart captured just the same!\nUnfortunately, it won’t be all tangled bedsheets and intense tete-a-tetes. Over in your detail-minded, hypercritical sixth house, passionate Mars in Libra could be stirring up anxiety and self-doubt until October 12.\nBut once that cycle ends, this angst-y energy lifts. Fierce Mars will move on to Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, heating up your seventh house of commitments. Once the red planet relocates to your relationship zone, your energy will get channeled into adding spicy adventures to your twosome time. The last couple weeks of the month could be seriously sexy—with things moving to official status or a more committed level fast. And with a lunar eclipse in Taurus on October 28, it’s anyone’s guess what could happen!\nTwo heads are definitely better than one during this seven-week phase, but keeping those heads cool is a whole other story. Beyond the passion and lust, Mars can fire you up in relationships—and this could spell “trouble in paradise.” Be patiently assertive with your partners in all areas of life. But remember: Just because you say “Jump!” doesn’t mean they’ll auto-respond with a swift “How high?”\nIt’s all in the details, Taurus! With energizer Mars in Libra and your organized, administrative sixth house until October 12, you’re revved up to get everything put in place. The Libra new moon on October 14—a galvanizing solar eclipse—is a great day to declutter, map out an org chart or look into hiring someone who can make your life fun more efficiently. Implementing new processes and systems can also be helpful. \nPartner up with the movers and shakers starting October 12, when Mars moves into Scorpio and your dynamic duos sector until November 24. You don’t have to do it all by yourself, Bull! But do get ready for your solo moment on October 28, when the Taurus full moon lights the fall skies as a lunar eclipse in your first house of personal passions. \nAdvocate for yourself and your ideas—and don’t be surprised if others rally to champion you, if not hop fully aboard in support. But just because they’re excited doesn’t mean they’re the right partners for you. If you’ve learned anything these past couple of years, it’s how to better screen people and make sure your relationships are a two-way street. This is the very last Taurus eclipse in a series that began back in November 2021. Acknowledge the lessons you’ve learned and step into your rightful role, as the leader of your own life!\nLove Days: 11, 14\nMoney Days: 3, 23\nLuck Days: 2, 21\nOff Days: 27, 13, 18\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(July 23 - August 22)\nAt last—some momentum returns! From social sync-ups to buzzy brainstorms to exciting business ideas, October is ripe for making connections. And let’s be honest, you’re catching up on lost time, thanks to a challenging summer. \nIt wasn’t easy being a Leo, although a little character-building patience isn’t the WORST thing. But still…Venus spent what felt like an endless six-week retrograde in Leo from July 22 until September 3. Then Mercury retrograde jumped in and dragged out the delays until September 15. Argh! If you felt stuck in a constant holding pattern or misunderstood at every turn, fasten your seat belt. Life’s about to move at a much swifter pace.\nEven better? You don’t have to do it alone. Until October 23, the Sun is in Libra and your third house of communication, ideas and kindred spirits. Finally you have an eager audience for your novel ideas! Life is so much easier when people are receptive, rather than resistant, to your ideas.\nEnergizer Mars is also in Libra until October 12, rekindling your fan base and sparking up your creativity. The first couple weeks of the month should be filled with exciting opportunities to share your message and get back on the same page as your crew.\nEclipse season picks up the action even more in the second half of the month. October will feature TWO eclipses—a Libra solar eclipse at the October 14 new moon and the final Taurus lunar (full moon) eclipse in a two-year series on October 28. These game-changing lunar lifts will sweep through your communication and career corners respectively, shaking up the stagnant parts. Out with the old! From unsatisfying friendships to professional plateaus, you are so done with it all. \nMidmonth, connect to as many innovative thinkers as you can. Explore synergies and test your chemistry with a small collab. Then get ready to bid adieu to a chapter of your career or a going-nowhere goal you’ve outgrown. Things are about to get a LOT more interesting, Leo—and way more “on brand” with the person you’ve become.\nCaveat: We’re not entirely done with retrogrades, but the planets that remain in this powered-down speed this October are the slow-moving outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and (until October 10) Pluto. Luckily these giants don’t really affect our day-to-day lives as much, and their retrogrades can actually be helpful times of integration and reflection.\nTwo of them, Jupiter and Uranus, are retrograde in Taurus and your career house. You’ll probably be more than ready for any changes that blow in with the October 28 eclipse. Perhaps your Halloween costume should simply be “Leo 2.0”—because by the time the month ends, you’ll feel like a whole new person.\nTake a little time to let that sink in. On October 23, Scorpio season begins, and the Sun takes a pre-holiday respite in your domestic fourth house. Catch up on things at Chateau Leo and make all those plans with family. A month from now, the spotlight will be shining directly on you, and you’ll want to have everything in place so you can finish the year with a star turn—the way the stars intend for you, Leo!\nLightness at last? October is one of the liveliest and most social months for you as the Sun makes its annual trip through Libra and your communicative third house until October 23. There’s nothing you love more than swapping stories with a kindred spirit as you share a decadent treat at that buzzy new cafe or window-shop for hours. \nIf you’re not talking about everything from your latest bingeable series and “oh my god you have to try it” organic skincare line to that session you just had with a psychic medium, you’ll be devouring books, podcasts and blogs that feed your need for fresh intel. Hello, hungry lion!\nAnd like a true cub, you need to romp and play. That impulse is even stronger this year since energetic Mars is in Libra until October 12, making you restless and shortening your attention span. Let your inner event planner have a field day during Libra season, hosting little parties or rallying the troops for excursions. Hit the fall festivals and gather your friends (and their friends) to check out new hotspots in your ‘hood. Gather recommendations for books, podcasts and restaurants to try. Your curiosity knows no bounds!\nDo your best to stay cool on October 8, when an explosive Mars-Pluto square provokes your critical side. With assertive Mars in your communication zone locked into a heated 90-degree square to intense Pluto in your controlling sixth house, you might feel attacked by someone’s harsh words. Your own micromanaging could put someone else on the defensive, making them feel like you’re doubting their judgment. Ask questions before you fling any accusations.\nIs the devil in the details? You may find out as soon as October 10, when transformational Pluto ends a five-month retrograde that began on May 1. The retrograde’s first leg was in Aquarius and your relationship sector. But on June 11, Pluto slipped back into Capricorn and your sixth house of health, organization and analytical thinking. \nPower struggles could have erupted, especially with employees or co-workers. If you’ve been dealing with anxiety or a health issue, it may have been hard to discern the cause with shadowy Pluto back-spinning like this. Chronic might have disrupted your sleep patterns or caused you to lapse into self-soothing habits like emotional eating.\nNow with Pluto resuming forward motion, you can corral the chaos and get to the root of what ails ya. Take a deep breath: You’ll be better able to manage people—and their dynamics—once Pluto straightens out. \nHave you been afraid to step into your power because you’re worried about pleasing others and being liked? No more! The dwarf planet’s course correction will help you get a better grip on mind-body-spirit balance. A nagging psychological or emotional issue may have been affecting your physical health. The link could soon become clear, putting you back on the path to wellness and vitality.\nShare your brilliance, Leo! The October 14 Libra new moon solar eclipse is an especially prime day to spark up a new friendship or have an important conversation. If you’re pitching a creative concept or meeting a would-be client, these moonbeams will give you the gift of gab, so schedule your appointments accordingly.\nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will recalibrate your communication sector between March 2023 and March 2025. Get ready for new ways to craft your message, share your ideas and join forces with kindred spirits. \nBut first: Do you still have any baggage around doing that? With la luna opposite wounded healer Chiron today, you may need to release some old fears about speaking up and being ostracized for your beliefs. It’s risky to wear your heart on your sleeve (even for a self-expressed Leo). At the end of the day, you want to be loved and praised for your ideas. \nWell, this Libra new moon might be an invitation to care a little less about what other people think and to start taking some risks! You don’t have to put everything out there all at once, either. Share a little taste of your ideas with the public. Take a class or a workshop to build your skills. Test your chemistry with a collaborator on a small project. Start treating life like a grand experiment instead of a performance or a juried competition. You’ll be much freer—and you’ll have a lot more fun! \nHad a little TOO much fun, Leo? Nesting time has arrived. On October 23, the Sun moves into Scorpio and your foundational fourth house. Home, family and emotional restoration are the themes for the next four weeks. Lean in to those so you can have a full tank for when Sagittarius and holiday season arrive in a month, your most festive time of year! \nWhat do you need to feel like you’re anchored and secure? This is a worthy exploration. You’re incredibly self-sufficient, but just because you CAN do it all yourself doesn’t mean you should. During Scorpio season, it’s okay to pare down your packed schedule and leave some white space in your calendar. Rest, contemplation and self-care will give your inner voice a chance to get a word in edgewise!\nFinding peace and quiet at home could be a little challenging, however. With super-active Mars in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, your household could be a heat zone. There may be visits from family, roommate friction or the extra stress of early holiday preparation. \nDon’t make it more dramatic than it needs to be, Leo. View any flare-ups as a sign. You might need to reconfigure your home’s layout for better space-sharing, especially if you’ve got introverts and extroverts overlapping in common areas. Maybe it’s time for some Fengclass=\"body-el-link standard-body-el-link\"  Shui or space clearing. (Check out our Home Reset course to usher in new energy.) With the eclipses stirring up so much, you might want to start these kinds of projects in November, after the dust settles!\nTake a break from all the personal-life stuff on October 28, when the year’s only full moon in Taurus, a partial lunar eclipse, beams into your tenth house of career, leadership and success. You could reach a professional pinnacle where you’re recognized for your talents and hard work. If you’ve been pondering whether to cut ties and move elsewhere, this full moon will light the way.\nToday’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021, radically refashioning the balance between career and home. Your personal and professional paths may look nothing like they did a couple years ago.\nWith expansive Jupiter in Taurus opposing dynamic Mars in Scorpio, you’ll feel this world-life dichotomy acutely today. In fact, you might be even quicker to hit a breaking point if you feel your two “selves” being split. Demands at home could really start to take a toll on your ambitions in ways that push you to the breaking point. \nReminder, Leo: You CAN and should redesign your life any way you like. But it’s up to you to ask the people around you to pull their weight or to make the necessary changes that support your dreams. You’ve got this—and today’s eclipse is here to drive that message home!\nWell…THAT was interesting. For the past four months (since June 5), you’ve been hosting love planet Venus in your sign—an extended trip since Venus typically only hangs out for about a month. Sounds dreamy? Alas, not so much. From July 22 to September 3, Venus was retrograde (backward), disrupting harmony and complicating matters for many Leos in love, friendship and all around ease. \nVenus has been doing her best to make it up to you for the past month since returning to direct (forward) motion in Leo. But it might have been too little, too late. So…let’s try this again next year, Venus? \nOn October 8, Venus move on to Virgo. As the love goddess decamps to your stable second house until November 8, she’ll whet your appetite for luxury and stability. Now you’ll settle into a more grounded romantic groove. \nWith Venus heating up your earthy second house, you’ll be attracted to reliable people who might have seemed “boring” at another time. For single Leos, sparks could fly with a coworker or someone you meet at an industry event. This realm rules your finances, so couples may need to smooth over any tension around money (luckily, peacemaker Venus is here to help). Whether your “security issues” are fiscal or emotional, talk them through and remember, you’re on the same team here. \nMeanwhile, Mars is charging through Libra until October 12, energizing your third house of communication and kindred spirits. You won’t be at a loss for meeting people now! You could meet someone who sweeps you off your suede booties when you least expect it. Pay attention to friends who insist they know the “perfect” person for you. For once, they might be right! \nCouples will appreciate having a chance to step out of any stressful circular conversations and just enjoy each other’s company. Organize some casual gatherings with mutual friends, like concerts or comedy shows. Variety can’t help but bring some sizzle to your shared life!\nHome is where the HEAT is once restless Mars grooves into Scorpio and your domestic sector from October 12 until November 24. No need to wait until the official holiday season to feather your nest or turn your place into a love den. If you’re a Leo who loves to entertain like La Martha herself, Mars will create a lively—and sexy—vibe for any get-togethers you might throw. \nCaution: demanding roomates and relatives could add friction (and not the good kind) to your household with intensifier Mars in Scorpio. Perhaps it’s time to reconfigure your layouts, creating more privacy for yourself. Is WFH life making it hard to unwind into a sensual groove after hours. Follow Virginia Woolf’s directive and find “a room of one’s own”—or a charming cafe—to do work outside your house.\nPut your money where your mouth is, Leo, and start spreading the news! With go-getter Mars in Libra and your communicative third house until October 12, your ideas are your currency. You may get a chance to pitch your ideas to a well-connected person at the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. Be ready—the opportunity could arrive in the last minute!\nA peak professional moment arrives at the October 28 Taurus lunar (full moon) eclipse, which floods your tenth house of career and success with its manifesting beams. Ready to throw in the towel on an unfulfilling job and try a new path? Poised for a promotion or to pitch a profitable prospective client? This is your moment to go for it. Bring on the deals! \nIf you’ve been on the fence about a job or role, it’s a great day to talk to the key players or decision makers and hash out a new, more fulfilling position for yourself. This is the final Taurus eclipse in a two-year series that’s been revolutionizing your career path. Don’t be surprised if an offer comes out of the blue, or a sudden change of the guard happens with your company or clientele. If someone is “eclipsed” away, trust that a much better fit is en route to you, Leo.\nLove Days: 18, 23\nMoney Days: 2, 11\nLuck Days: 27, 9\nOff Days: 6, 21, 25\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Cancer Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:06", "text": "(June 21 - July 22)\nIt’s the (second) most Cancerian time of the year! With the Sun visiting Libra and your cozy, domestic fourth house—the zodiac zone ruled by Cancer—October puts you in your nurturing, nesting element. Motivator Mars is also in Libra until October 12, energizing your efforts. Whether you’re hosting loved ones, changing up your seasonal decor or getting an early start on holiday prep, your inner “householder” is running at warp speed. (Just please don’t hang up any Christomas lights before Halloween, okay?)\nYour ruling planet, the moon, is as busy as you are this month! Two eclipses will activate the skies in the second half of October, moving any stuck energy forward around your living situation, family and friendships. Eclipses are turbocharger transits, pushing us past plateaus whether we’re ready or not. Stay ready for action this month, Cancer, because things could move fast.\nRelationships also regain steam after October 10, when alchemical Pluto ends a five-month retrograde and pivots forward in Capricorn, adding potency to your partnership realm. The other four slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are still retrograde all month long. But with the eclipses sparking up so much action, you might be grateful to have a few parts of your life on temporary hold.\nOne part that will be far from dormant after October 23: your love life! That day, the Sun sidles into Scorpio for a month, heating up your fifth house of passion, pleasure and play. With spicy Mars here from October 12 until November 24, you’ve got an extended cuffing season. Not that you’ll necessarily want to be “cuffed.” With the Sun and Mars in this frisky zone, you might enjoy basking in the attention of many admirers rather than rushing into an exclusive. If you’re already partnered, enjoy the romantic boost. Halloween costumes could be even more fun to take off than they are to put on. Oh behave! Wait…no, don’t!\nAll the feelings! The emotion ocean is reaching high tide this October, with a few extra currents pulling you this way and that. For starters, the Sun is in Libra and your sensitive and sentimental fourth house until October 23, which always puts you in a nostalgic state.\nAs the natural ruler of the zodiac’s fourth house, you’re usually “in the zone” during Libra season as el Sol travels through the foundation of your solar chart and draws out your nurturing and domestic side. Your attention is focused on your family or domicile as the Sun illuminates this most personal part of your life. Ambitious plans and worldly duties can wait. You’ve got root vegetables roasting in the oven and a “vintage botanicals” Pinterest board underway. (Priorities, people!)\nThis Libra session is extra lit with energizer Mars in Libra on October 12 and a Libra new moon that’s also a solar eclipse on October 14. Change won’t come to your personal life with much subtlety. Get ready for some possible pivots, from a change of address to unexpected visits from relatives to a sudden urge to change up your entire home decor scheme. Easy does it, Crab! You could quickly get in over your head, underestimating the amount of work required to pull off an ambitious domestic or hosting plan.\nWatch those volatile emotions this October 8, when combative Mars locks horns in a tense square with vengeful Pluto. Touchy Mars is in Libra and your emotional fourth house until October 12, making you thin-skinned. As the red planet clashes with Pluto in your relationship zone, strong emotions may get the better of you. If you find yourself at wits’ end, pause for self-care instead of forcing a conversation or staging a stormy confrontation. \nThings in a key relationship could blow up—and perhaps this will be a good thing in the long run. Sometimes things just have to come into the open before they can get better. But if there’s any way to have this showdown another day, you’ll have less damage control to do. Unless someone’s behavior or actions need to be addressed immediately, take a timeout to assess the right course of action.\nTransforming your relationships is an important item of business starting October 10, when karmic Pluto ends a five-month retrograde in Capricorn and your partnership zone. Have you been embroiled in a power struggle with a key person? Maybe you’ve been hashing out deal points but keep stopping shy of signing on the dotted line for a professional venture. \nEnergetically, something’s been holding you back or getting in the way of making things official…but perhaps it’s a blessing in disguise? Now that Pluto returns to forward motion, you can see these dynamics more clearly and work to balance them. With cuffing season underway, it’s a great time to apply your new insights to an existing relationship or with new long-term prospects!\nChange arrives at your doorstep—literally—on October 14. The year’s only Libra new moon is a solar eclipse, setting off a fresh six-month cycle for matters of home and heart. Eclipses are harbingers of unpredictable change. These moonbeams will propel you to turn to a fresh page with loved ones. Maybe you’ll suddenly scout for a new address or living situation if you’re in the market for that. (You could find out unexpectedly that you are!) \nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your personal and professional life between March 2023 and March 2025. For the past six months, many Crabs started craving a better distribution of time spent between work and home. Perhaps your career became more demanding, forcing you to delegate some of the household work or vice versa. Maybe you picked up the slack with some family caretaking and needed someone else to hold down the work fort.\nIf you’re burnt out on your responsibilities, this inaugural Libra eclipse is here to help you add more self-care, art and creativity to your life. Libra, after all, is the sign of balance. The most important thing you can do now is find some of that for yourself. With the eclipse opposing wounded healer Chiron in Aries, you may find that some of your inner journeying informs your next career moves.\nReady to bring a few fall colors back into your life? Some well-deserved fun arrives on October 23, when the Sun moves into fellow water sign Scorpio and your fifth house of pleasure, passion and play. Creativity spikes with your mojo; a fall romance could heat up before the holiday season begins. If you’re in a relationship, get some date nights and fun outings on the calendar, along with a few occasions to pull out your glam gear, even if it’s for a small event you host. (You look adorable in athleisure, Crab, but you clean up nicely too!) Scorpio season ignites your fifth house of creativity, a time to get free-range with an artistic project or put your talents on display.\nLusty Mars will join the Sun in Scorpio, visiting this libidinous lair from October 12 to November 24. Get ready for the passionate energy to dial up another ten notches! Suddenly you’re turning heads and attracting attention with little effort. Enjoy basking in that admiration and let the spotlight reveal your multifaceted talents already. \nYou could draw fame quickly with Mars here, but warning: Drama is just as likely to find you. Your emotions are heightened, and the filters are off with combative Mars in this expressive zone. Watch those knee-jerk reactions, which will be even more amplified by the intensity of eclipse season. Channel your diva and dramatic inclinations into a sexy Halloween costume and even sultrier celebration.\nIf things get a little TOO intense, you can take a huge step back at the October 28 Taurus full moon, which is a partial lunar eclipse. La luna lands in your eleventh house of objective thinking, helping you pull back from the heat zone and cool down. Instead of getting swept up in emotions, you can be the diplomat in the room, helping everyone feel seen and heard.\nToday’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. For the past two years, you’ve been learning to navigate the line between drama and detachment. When is the right time to step into the spotlight and when should you be a team player? The Taurus/Scorpio eclipses gave you equal opportunities to steal the show and be an awesome “backup dancer.”\nHave you been way too much of a solo act? The lunar eclipse could bring an exciting opportunity to collaborate, perhaps with someone you meet online or through a cutting-edge community project with a social justice twist. You could connect with a like-minded group of people or discover firsthand how much power there is in numbers. Since full moons can bring endings or transitions, you may part ways with a friend or clique and start hanging out with people who are more on your wavelength. Since eclipses can move at a much more radical pace, you might abruptly part ways with a friendship or a group and move on to another affiliation.\nExpansive Jupiter in Taurus will oppose Mars in Scorpio today, underscoring your need to be around people who support your ascent rather than diminish it. Let the jealous haters go elsewhere. You need to be around people who celebrate your full, authentic expression.\nMatters of security are on your mind during the first half of the month, as the love planets move through more stabilizing zones of your chart. Mars is in Libra and your fourth house of home, family and emotional security until October 12. Meanwhile, Venus is rounding out an extended four-month trip to Leo and your rooted second house that’s spanned from June 5 to October 8.\nWhile it might sound romantic to host the love planet in this passionate sign for four whole months, there was a plot twist. Venus was in a tricky retrograde cycle from July 22 until September 3, disrupting any hopes of a memorable summer love.\nFear not, Cancer: Your do-over has arrived! The month moves into a flirty and confident phase on October 8 when Venus moves into Virgo and your social, lighthearted third house until November 8. Now, rather than worry about where things are going, you’re feeling independent. If you’re unattached, you may be more interested in cantering around the pasture than in tying up to any one hitching post in particular. You could meet someone through mutual friends or while out on the town.\nThis frisky energy builds to a crescendo starting October 12, when white-hot Mars zips into Scorpio and your fifth house of fame, passion and romance until November 24. When it comes to love, you tend to favor exclusive relationships, but this could be the moment where you finally discover the joy of casual dating. Dress up as often as you can, if only to make yourself happy (and definitely for Halloween). Baby fever could strike some Crabs now, and if at first you don’t succeed, Mars gives you the momentum (and libido) to try, try again. \nHome, profitable home? With energizer Mars in Libra until October 12 along with the Sun (through October 23), your domestic fourth house is a hot spot. If you work remotely, this is a prime month to get your home office set up for maximum productivity or start a cottage-industry side hustle. \nEven if you report to an offsite location, you’ll still want to bring the crisp edges back to your home, doing a deep clean and purging your file cabinets, for example, or investing in some decor upgrades. Got a room or space you can put on Airbnb or VRBO? Consider supplementing your income with some extra rental cash, especially near the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. \nAll together now! The Taurus full moon, a powerful lunar eclipse, could bring your shared efforts to a peak moment this October 28. If you have a team project to complete or a tech venture to launch, this eclipse will add momentum. Eclipses bring surprises, and this one could impact the people in your org chart. A colleague or group member could make a sudden departure, perhaps getting recruited to a new job or department. \nIs it time to make your own digital debut? With Mars in Scorpio and your fame-worthy fifth house from October 12 to November 24, this eclipse could put you on center stage with a viral post or a meaningful message.\nLove Days: 14, 21\nMoney Days: 27, 9\nLuck Days: 6, 25\nOff Days: 3, 18, 23\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(September 23 - October 22)\nOctober’s cosmic marquee has “Libra! Libra! Libra!” written all over it. Not only is the Sun in your sign until October 23, but the spotlight’s a few megawatts brighter (and hotter) while mojo-boosting Mars is also in Libra until October 12. Things are moving at a much more rapid clip than you’re used to, which could be equal parts stressful and exciting. Load up on the immune-boosting supplements, especially if you’re running all over the place. (Being in demand brings perks AND challenges.) \nMidmonth, one of the most powerful moments you’ve had since 2016 arrives. The Libra new moon is a change-making solar eclipse, the first to land in your sign in seven years. Ready or not, a new chapter is beginning—and this time, it’s custom-tailored to the person you’ve become. Allow inauthentic relationships and roles to fall away. Shed that skin and step out as a truer, more self-actualized you.\nSo yeah, it might sound like a lot, Libra, but consider the alternative: Summer 2023. Suffice to say, you’ve earned a do-over! October is a welcome relief from the uphill battle you’ve waged with the stars since July—and you’re just crawling out of that now.\nIt all started on July 22, when your ruling planet, Venus, turned retrograde for six weeks, making you feel out of sync socially and emotionally until September 3. Layered on top of it, you endured energy planet Mars in Virgo and your sluggish twelfth house until August 27. Then, adding insult to injury, mental Mercury turned retrograde, shrouding you in mental fog from August 23 until September 15. If you felt invisible, exhausted and adrift at moments, that cosmic lineup certainly played a role.\nThe slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) are all still retrograde this month. But on October 10, Pluto will straighten out, correcting course in Capricorn and your family sector. Challenges in your living situation or with loved ones should get easier, particularly if you’ve had any power struggles.\nEclipses come in pairs, and the October 14 solar eclipse is the first of this month’s duo. The second one, a lunar (full moon) eclipse, will land in Taurus on October 28, touching down in your eighth house of intimacy and investments. It’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled over the Taurus/Scorpio axis for the past two years, revolutionizing your approach to money, self-worth, shared property and the ties that bind.\nSeal those changes with a ritual, perhaps on Halloween. That day, the moon will be in Gemini and your expansive ninth house, putting you in optimistic and adventurous spirits. You’ve had enough of those cosmic tricks. Now it’s time to be treated to a wide-angle view of the possible treats that await you, Libra. Let the transformational power of the eclipses carry you over that threshold!\nIn it to win it! This year’s Libra season charges out of the gate at an especially frisky pace as the Sun soars through your sign until October 23, joined by activator Mars, the planet of energy and drive, which is making its biennial blast through Libra until October 12. This October, your trailblazing initiatives could start a huge buzz. \nThe balance your sign is forever seeking may be in short supply as the Sun and Mars keep your schedule action-packed. Roll with it for now, Libra. You’re the spotlight’s favorite target, so shamelessly self-promote! On top of that, a rare Libra solar eclipse arrives at the October 14 new moon, pushing you into prominence and power. Seize this rare opportunity. \nLibra may be the sign of peace, love and harmony, but when you sense injustice, you can see red. Your legendary patience could evaporate on October 8, when aggravator Mars locks into a heated square with manipulative Pluto, ramping up the conflict and tension. \nMars is in Libra and your first house of self until October 12 while Pluto’s simmering in Capricorn and your home and family sector. Those ties that bind could feel downright suffocating today. Is a close person trying to manipulate you by tugging on your heartstrings? Hold your ground in the face of emotional blackmail and don’t take the codependent bait. You may need to assert yourself in a way that feels unusually forceful. \nIt’s not always comfortable to individuate from your family or support circle—Libras as a rule dislike conflict. But the Mars-Pluto square is demanding that you step up and voice your needs powerfully.\nFamily and home take a turn for the better on October 10, when karmic Pluto ends a five-month retrograde that began on May 1. Until June 11, Pluto was reversing through Aquarius, stirring the pot in your fifth house of romance. Then it slipped into Capricorn and your domestic fourth house for the duration of its backspin. \nSince mid-June, you’ve been navigating intense moods and what felt like a series of emotional earthquakes, especially in your household. Power dynamics with a female relative in particular may have been volatile, with seething resentment or outright anger welling up from the depths. \nMaybe your thoughts turned to your ancestors, with dreams about departed loved ones so vivid that they felt like a visitation. Old family patterns and baggage could have surfaced, making this a productive (if painful) time to process the past and untangle those knots. If you’re a parent, you may have struggled with separation issues between yourself and a child—either feeling smothered by too much closeness or fearful when they pulled away.\nThat begins to change once Pluto resumes forward motion, helping you pierce the veil of confusion. You’ll be better able to connect the dots and address household conflict at the root, and to let your loved ones be individuated people as you figure out a healthy level of bonding. If the energy in your house feels off, you might experiment with some Feng Shui techniques, starting with a space cleclass=\"body-el-link standard-body-el-link\" aring and deep cleaning. (Check out our Home Reset course for a deep dive.) As you work through emotional issues AND beautify your space, you’ll begin to feel comfortable in your skin again—at home inside yourself.\nRebirth! The October 14 Libra new moon could be a day when fortune and favor smile upon you. Not only is this the sole new moon in your sign this year, but it’s a boldfaced solar eclipse. Think of it as your personal new year or a fresh start times ten. It’s a day to set intentions for the coming six months and then take a bold step forward on your path. \nWhat personal goal would you like to achieve before 2023 closes out? Connect and commit to that today; these me-first moonbeams have your back! \nThis is the first time an eclipse has fallen in Libra since 2016, so it’s an even bigger deal. Ask yourself: What do YOU want? That can be a hard question for your partnership-oriented sign to answer, especially since the moon is opposite healer-feeler Chiron in Aries today. You might feel guilty or torn about wanting something just for yourself. \nBut the stars are lined up in full support of that now. It’s okay to prioritize yourself, Libra. You’ll be learning to strike the right balance between “me” and “we” through March 2025, during a two-year eclipse series on the Aries/Libra axis. Give yourself time. There will be moments where your own projects need top billing and other times where cooperation and teamwork are called for most. You can expect to have a hearty dose of both!\nSome grounding energy comes in beginning October 23, when the Sun shifts gears into Scorpio and your second house of money, routines and stability. The excitement and excess of Libra season gives way to an industrious groove. Prioritize your projects and devote your time to the ones that will build a sense of security—and a nest egg. \nIf birthday binges left you and your wallet with a lingering hangover (well worth the fun!), you can get back to some daily practices and healthy habits that help you feel centered. With go-getter Mars in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, this year’s Scorpio season is filled with motivating energy that can rev up your revenue and position you for prosperity before the year ends.\nWho needs Halloween to get spooky…or freaky? This October 28, a lunar eclipse arrives at the Taurus full moon, beaming into your eighth house of mysteries, eroticism and power. This full moon might mark a turning point in a key relationship: Should you stay or should you go? A simmering sexual attraction could reach the point of no return. Longtime couples may venture onto more permanent terrain, such as an engagement, pregnancy or perhaps an official split. Strong emotions can surge up from the depths today, surprising even you.\nToday is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s traveled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. For the past two years, major shifts around money, self-worth, sex and shared investments have been sparked by the eclipses. What’s “mine” and what’s “ours” got some serious sorting out. And you could feel a strong tug to draw that line at the eclipse, especially with expansive Jupiter in Taurus opposing aggro Mars in Taurus. Anyone making too many demands on you could push you over the edge.\nAs the eclipse blasts into your eighth house of merging, intimacy and joint ventures, you might be offered an opportunity to blend your superpowers in a shared business project, but be sure to conduct due diligence before you go all in. Legal and real estate matters can be resolved, and since the eighth house rules windfalls, you could receive word of a large lump sum (hopefully being paid TO you, not BY you). Look back to the May 19 Taurus new moon for clues of what’s likely to develop now.\nLook out for Libra! Lusty Mars is on its biennial tour of your sign until October 12, making you irresistibly magnetic, upping your already serious charisma and drawing attention your way wherever you go—especially locally. On top of that, there’s a solar eclipse in your sign on October 14, putting all eyes on you again.\nMake a point of putting yourself out there and letting your sensual side lead. Mars here can offset some of your natural tactfulness, and without meaning to, you could come off a bit opinionated or argumentative. By all means, be direct about your desires. Just give others the same room to express themselves too.\nIf you’re in a LTR, the first two weeks of October are a great cycle for open, honest communication and being crystal-clear about any needs that aren’t being met. Your side of the bargain: Listen as much as you talk, and don’t get defensive (which Mars can exacerbate). Assume your partner has valid points and, later, take an unblinking look at behaviors you might actually want to shift. Once things are in a nice groove, focus on doing more together as a couple, like taking classes, exploring your neighborhood or taking short romantic day trips.\nMeantime, romantic Venus, your ruler, is wrapping up a four-month tour of Leo and your friendship sector that began on June 5. If a connection wavered from platonic to possibly-maybe-romantic all summer, no surprise. Venus was retrograde from July 22 to September 3, making you hesitant at best to explore a connection with more than a toe in the water.\nVenus has been in direct (forward) motion for the last month, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should rush into anything without due diligence. From October 8 to November 8, Venus will visit Virgo and your twelfth house of fantasy and closure. On the one hand, this could be a wildly windswept and romantic time. But it could also be a time of mixed messages and confusions while the love goddess traverses these foggy lands. \nDial up the sensuality and luxury—and try not to worry to much about “where things are going.” That could be challenging, however, as driven Mars will be in Scorpio and your security-seeking second house from October 12 to November 24. While your appetite for luxury will be off the charts now, you might also bicker over money or feel anxious about locking down a clear commitment from someone. Perhaps you’ll be the one who feels pressure from a “person of interest” who’s pushing for clarification when you’re just trying to explore.\nStill, you may not be able to push a decision off until next month. A major moment of truth could arrive at the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse, which floods your eighth house of erotic encounters, intimacy and permanent bonds. The eighth house is pretty black-and-white, and you may be given an ultimatum. Information could surface that pushes you firmly in one direction. It could be as wild as finding out a secret or someone surprising you with a full moon proposal. \nLibras hate making decisions under duress, but sometimes eclipses have to push you off the fence and into action—before you lose a good thing or miss your moment to exit a situation that’s dragged on past its prime.\nPut yourself out there, front and center! This is one of the hottest months of 2023 to make your grand debut, loud and proud. Not only is the Sun in Libra until October 23, but mojo-booster Mars is also in your sign through October 12, pushing you into the spotlight. And if that wasn’t enough, there’s a solar eclipse—a supercharged new moon—in Libra on October 14.\nDon’t be surprised if you draw attention for your trailblazing ideas—no need to apologize for tooting your own horn. If your ideas are great and can change people’s lives, why wouldn’t you want the world to know about them? \nYou can start making money moves on October 12, when Mars makes a fiery trail into Scorpio and your second house of money and earned income. Between now and November 24, you may have a few more expenses, but they’ll also motivate you to raise your rates or seek new revenue sources, which you’ll attract easily under this dynamic transit.\nThe month ends with the October 28 lunar (full moon) eclipse in Taurus and your eighth house of investments, joint venture and windfalls. Expect the unexpected—hopefully in a large lump sum with a few extra zeros added to the end! You could get a sudden opportunity to buy or sell property, team up with a powerful collaborator of earn a commission. If you’ve been dealing with an ongoing legal matter over the past couple years, things could be finalized and settled at this eclipse.\nLove Days: 23, 27\nMoney Days: 6, 14\nLuck Days: 3, 13\nOff Days: 11, 2\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Virgo Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:07", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(August 23 - September 22)\nSweet stability at last! October will be eventful, but it still holds plenty of opportunities to get settled and centered. Prune your plans and prioritize your options. Focus on one or two key items, especially during the first three weeks while the Sun is in Libra and your sensible second house. Better to do less but do it well!\nAs a Virgo, you like feeling that you’re making progress toward a goal, even if your process is all over the map. That hasn’t been easy for the past couple months, which were wildly unpredictable for you. First, creative Venus was retrograde for six weeks starting July 22, making your mind foggy and your load too burdensome. Then your ruler, Mercury, joined the retrograde brigade, back-spining for nearly the entire Virgo season, from August 23 to September 15. Talk about a buzzkill! One Virgo friend of ours wisely took the month off to travel through Europe. Well-timed indeed.\nNow, after feeling a bit like a helium balloon with the air let out of it, you can get yourself grounded. Or at least, begin the process. Because, as we hinted, October has a few more plot twists in store. Two, to be exact: a solar eclipse on October 14 and a lunar eclipse on October 28.\nThe first one is in Libra, which could bring new revenue streams and moneymaking opportunities. If you need to ground yourself with regular routines and healthy habits, this October 14 eclipse gives you a giant boost. The October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse touches down in your ninth house of travel, study and personal growth. It’s the grand/finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled over the Taurus/Scorpio axis for the past two years, revolutionizing your approach to communication, learning and social connections. \nWhile Libra season will keep you busy and productive, your social life picks up speed on October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your interactive third house. With energizer Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, a fun and flirty fall awaits. Step away from your duties and go mingle with kindred spirits and fellow innovators. Exchanging ideas (and contact info) will do more for you now than being chained to your workspace.\nRSVP “yes” to that Halloween party, especially if there’s a networking component. With the moon in Gemini and your career corner on October 31, mixing business with pleasure—and costumes!—could put some extra goodies in your basket.\nProductivity returns! We’re in the fourth quarter of 2024, meaning it’s time to make a plan. Music to your Virgo ears! With the Sun in Libra and your sensible, sensual second house, the stage is set for you to get ‘er done. Unleash your inner project manager, and you’ll soon feel back on track. \nNormally, you’re on top of your game every fall. But thanks to Mercury’s long retrograde in your sign from August 23 to September 15, motivation and focus went MIA. Don’t worry if you’re making up for lost time. You can accomplish a lot now—AND treat yourself to a few luxe rewards along the way. \nThis year, you get a bonus bottom-line boost from energetic Mars, which is making its biennial blaze through Libra until October 12. As the red planet revs up your revenue, a project or plan could heat up fast. Be careful what you wish for, Virgo. You could end up with your hands in many different pots (of gold, but still…) or juggling an accelerated schedule. Be extra discerning about what you take on. Before you say yes, make sure it’s both profitable AND pleasurable for you!\nYou normally keep a level head, Virgo, but even your even-keeled sign can lose it from time to time. Make an extra effort to hold your fire on October 8 if you can. That day, a volatile square forms between hotheaded Mars in your security-seeking second house and intense Pluto in your dramatic fifth.\nOne part of you wants to stir the pot just to see if you can get a rise out of someone. Maybe you’re craving attention or feeling insecure and needing to test whether they care about you. But instead of pushing THEIR sensitive buttons, how about just asking point-blank where you stand? Being overly direct may not work, but taking a back-door approach won’t either. (And don’t even THINK about snooping, Virgo.)\nYour desire to share your gifts returns with a vengeance on October 10 as transformational Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde that began on May 1. For the majority of the retrograde (since June 11), Pluto’s been reverse-commuting through Capricorn and your fifth house of creativity, passion and self-expression. \nOver the summer, you may have dipped below the radar, hiding your radiance while feeling self-conscious. If you were struck with a bout of stage fright or performance anxiety, Pluto’s return to forward motion reminds you that you have something meaningful to offer to the world! Instead of worrying about doing it “perfectly,” focus on the lives you’ll improve with your gifts and talents.\nA love affair or relationship may have gone through intense cycles during Pluto’s retrograde. Perhaps an ex surfaced, or you had to work through some old fears and baggage in your current union. That old “come here, now go away” dance gets exhausting! You deserve a break from that confusion, Virgo, and as Pluto corrects course, clarity returns. Should you cut ties or stick around and work through a difficult dynamic? That answer will soon become clear.\nDid someone say abundance? Get ready for some money moves as the October 14 Libra new moon—a potent solar eclipse—kicks off a prosperous six-month cycle. This boldfaced eclipse in your second house of financial security could start changing everything from how you make a living to your daily routines. If you’re thinking of initiating a new regimen, like eating cleaner or going to a sunrise boot camp, this lunar lift is a perfect start date. \nThis is also the very first Libra eclipse the skies have seen since 2014 to 2016, so you might look back to nearly a decade ago when the eclipses were last in Aries and Libra. That was a powerful time of transformation for your money, investments, intimate partnerships and spirituality, Virgo. And from March 2023 until March 2025, you’re going through another cosmic cycle that will not only rev up your revenue streams but revolutionize them too. \nGot money wounds lingering? This solar eclipse will be opposite healer-feeler Chiron, giving you a chance to dive deep into your past and explore what might still be there. While that won’t necessarily be comfortable, it’s important to clear those blocks out of your path. Just because you don’t acknowledge them doesn’t mean they don’t exist! But fear not: You’ll have a couple years of rich and eye-opening experiences that will remind you how powerful you truly are.\nStep away from your work and get out among the people again! On October 23, the Sun moves into Scorpio, heating up your third house of communication and community. Your brilliant ideas could find a solid fan base and an eager audience. Kindred spirits can pop out of the woodwork, and everything will be more enjoyable when you make it interactive rather than isolating yourself. \nGot an important message to share? With bold Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, you’ll have the planet-powered confidence and courage to speak your truth. Use all the social media and in-person channels you can to connect with like-minded people. RSVP “yes” to events where you can meet more of them. But pace yourself a little bit as you’re unlikely to know your limits and could easily overdo it!\nNo limits! On October 28, the year’s only Taurus full moon arrives as a partial lunar eclipse, illuminating your expansive and adventurous ninth house. This is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. \nThe way you think, view the world and express yourself have been indelibly impacted by these eclipses. You’ve grown bolder in your expression, more willing to take a chance in business and life. Your adventurous spirit got a chance to flap its wings and fly!\nSince the ninth house rules global connections, risk-taking and growth, this lunar eclipse could bring an utterly magical moment in which one of your gambles pays off or a visionary idea springs to life—and spreads like wildfire. Your hunger for knowledge could be sated by a mind-blowing realization that helps you see a situation from a new perspective. Suddenly everything makes sense. \nWith worldly Jupiter in Taurus opposing dynamic Mars in your third house of local events today, you might have a real itch to get out of city limits. An opportunity to travel could arise out of the blue. Don’t overthink it. Two words: Wheels up!\nAt last! Your long-overdue time to shine is about to be here, Virgo. We’re gonna come out and say it: You’ve weathered insult to injury the entire summer and into fall, and your love life was one of the casualties. Not only was your ruling planet Mercury retrograde in your sign from August 23 to September 15, but love planet Venus has been in Leo and your foggy, fumbling twelfth house for FOUR months (since June 5)—with the audacity to go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. \nSo…drumroll. On October 8, Venus FINALLY wraps her off-duty summer and enters the realm of Virgo! For one solid month, the love goddess will dance with silk scarves and resume her sultry moves on your behalf. Great ready for an amorous awakening! Freedom is your aphrodisiac this month, so revel in all the admiration that comes your way. And with Venus in your self-empowered first house, you can have a lovingly honest conversation about what you need to feel happy and NOT claustrophobic.\nBut for the first week of October, you may have to wade through a few lingering insecure and vulnerable moments. And with Mars in Libra and your security-seeking second house until October 12, you could be a bit preoccupied with “where things are going” and ticking off the requisite boxes. \nTry NOT to give into those concerns too much, Virgo, because from October 12 to November 24, Mars will blaze through Scorpio and your social, interactive third house. You’re about to lighten up in a huge way. This will make for a flirtatious and festive lead-up to the holidays.\nWith bold and fiery Mars in your communication zone until November 24, you’ll be quick with a clever quip and a sassy retort. Warning: Mars adds a bite to your communications. This might come in handy when you have to stand up for yourself, but it could burn some bridges if you keep it up 24/7. \nFriendships will be lively, but you’ll be clear about who you can stand and who works your nerves. One of those platonic peeps could turn into something more under the spell of impulsive, randy Mars. Don’t rush to make it more than it is, though. If it’s a fall fling, let it be just that. There’s no harm in having a little fun—and if anyone’s earned the right to a frisky free ride now, Virgo, it’s you!\nOctober could be one of your most profitable months of 2023 if you play your hand right. The Sun is in Libra and your second house of work and money until October 23 while motivator Mars is revving up your revenue through October 12. There might be a few aggravating expenses thanks to Mars, but there are twice as many chances to multiply your money-making. Don’t overthink it: get moving!\nWith the October 14 Libra solar eclipse delivering fresh-start energy to your finance sector, a new opportunity or income stream could appear. Eclipses bring surprises and this one might come with dollar signs attached. Your efforts could pay off quickly and build up momentum over the next six months. \nThe October 28 lunar eclipse in Taurus could bring an exciting opportunity to launch a business, publish your work or teach your subject matter expertise at a university or continuing education level. A sudden travel invitation could also arrive that’s related to sharing your big ideas with the wider world. Keep your suitcase and jetsetting accouterments ready!\nLove Days: 21, 25\nMoney Days: 3, 13\nLuck Days: 2, 11\nOff Days: 27, 9, 23\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(December 22 - January 19)\nThe waiting game is coming to an end, Capricorn! This month is filled with gutsy moves and powerful networking opportunities as the Sun travels through the top of your chart, heating up your most public sectors. Not only is the Sun in Libra and your professional tenth house until October 23, but energizer Mars is also making its biennial blaze through this zone until October 12. \nTwo days later, on October 14, eclipse season begins with a potent solar (new moon) eclipse in Libra and this same ambitious sector. And on October 28, a second eclipse, this one a lunar (full moon) version, beams into your fifth house of fame and self-expression. Lights, camera, Capricorn! Your solo moment is coming. No need to wait for Halloween to put on a show and turn some heads.\nThe good news rolls in all month, really. On October 10, powerhouse Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde that started on May 1, splitting time between Aquarius and Capricorn. Since June 11, Pluto’s been backsliding through YOUR sign, making it hard for your ideas and personal projects to gain proper traction. That will change as Pluto rockets into direct motion again, rounding out a 16-year, once-in-a-lifetime tour of your sign that ends in 2024. \nAll four of the other outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are still retrograde this month, but you might be grateful for a little slowdown to the action. Saturn and Neptune are reversing through Pisces and your third house of communication and ideas. Take your time before unleashing all of your best material on the interwebs, Cap! Jupiter and Uranus are retrograde in Taurus and your passionate fifth house, tempering that eclipse a teensy bit. So maybe you won’t let it ALL hang out just yet…but start warming up the mic anyhow.\nOn October 23, the Sun moves into Scorpio and your eleventh house of groups, teams and networking. Unchain yourself from command central and go circulate! This social season lightens your spirits and attracts like-minded people who could become great collaborators. Get to the Halloween parties and set up those lunches before everyone gets too busy with year-end and holiday mania. You’ve got places to go and people to meet!\nGet to work, Capricorn! Your marching orders come direct from the cosmos while the Sun makes methodical steps through Libra and your structured, ambitious tenth house until October 23. As the natural ruler of that realm, Capricorns should truly feel “in the zone,” ready to take last month’s lofty ideas and plug them into concrete goals.\nThis year is even more ambitious because you’ve got energizer Mars burning through Libra until October 12, making you resemble every hard-working, hustling Capricorn stereotype. No shame in that, though! The tenth house is the zone of leadership and public image, and with Mars here, you can rise to a new level of prominence. \nIf you’re not plotting your meteoric rise at the moment, it’s still an excellent month to clarify a few “pillars” that you’d like to focus on achieving for the remainder of 2023. Close your eyes and imagine it’s New Year’s Eve: What would you like to say you accomplished and raise a toast to yourself for, Cap? Prioritize THAT and make some bold moves. The October 14 Libra solar eclipse could open a huge portal for your efforts, perhaps one you didn’t even imagine or anticipate!\nSome career chaos could erupt on October 8, when hotheaded Mars, which is in Libra and your professional tenth house until October 12, clashes in a stressful square with powerhouse Pluto in Capricorn. Your own vision could be at odds with the group’s, or you may lock into a power struggle with a person in a position of authority. \nWhere are YOU feeling trapped by rules, roles and responsibilities? Your soul might be longing for some freedom of expression, yet crushing demands and deadlines are thwarting that. Instead of having a meltdown (if that’s avoidable), use this jarring come-to-the-light moment to STOP doing things that sabotage you personally and professionally. Saying no to what doesn’t work might be the simplest first step. You don’t have to carry the weight of the whole world, Capricorn!\nYour call to greatness gets amplified by transformational powerhouse Pluto, which wakes up from a five-month retrograde on October 10, powering forward in YOUR sign. As karmic Pluto shifts into direct motion, you’ll emerge from the shadows and step back into the spotlight. Didn’t see that coming, did they? \nIf you’ve been hiding out or dimming your lights, Pluto’s course correction turns up the intensity again. A personal project could speed up, especially if you’ve been blocked by a few obstacles or resistant people who seemed to be undermining your efforts. Have you been considering a style revamp or a major life change? The soul-searching you did over the spring and summer could now pay off, inspiring you to make decisive moves.\nReady for a change to your professional path? Ready or not, one could be en route. The October 14 Libra new moon is the perfect day to start something new professionally or to get going on a major goal. \nDon’t worry, you’ve got the wind at your back in a major way. Today’s new moon is also a boldfaced solar eclipse, the first one in Libra and your career zone since 2016. It’s part of a two-year series that will ripple across the Aries/Libra axis, transforming your personal and professional lives. If you’ve felt polarized between the two, these eclipses, which are occurring between March 2023 and March 2025, can help you become a better-integrated person. \nWith today’s new moon sitting opposite healer-feeler Chiron, you may have some deep insights into childhood wounds that you’re still carrying with regards to your work. Perhaps you’ve avoided pain by immersing yourself in a sense of duty, both at home and the office. Maybe you feel locked into an uber-responsible persona, carrying the weight of the world and your loved ones but never letting yourself have any fun! \nUntangling this will be a process, but today’s eclipse will push you into a place where you’ll consider what happiness and professional fulfillment could look like for the person you’ve become. Stay open: It could be wildly different from anything you’ve done so far.\nLevity arrives on October 23, when the Sun shifts gears, moving into Scorpio and your eleventh house of groups, teamwork and technology. Step away from your workspace and go mingle. You’ll accomplish more when you focus on “who you know” rather than “what you do.” \nWith Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 through November 24, teamwork will be catalyzed. Between now and mid-December, a splashy launch, especially of any digital projects, could grab hold of public attention!\nYour passionate side ignites as the October 28 Taurus full moon—a powerful lunar eclipse—blooms in your fifth house of self-expression, romance and fame. This once-a-year lunation brings out your full-bodied, perhaps lesser-seen, side.\nToday’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. You’ve been learning to navigate between head and heart, to figure out when to be the star and when it’s better to be a team player. With expansive Jupiter in Taurus opposite Mars in Scorpio today, you could feel this stretch even more acutely. Should you dive in with your whole heart or hold back a little and play it cool? That’s the equation you’ve been working out.\nYou’ve had a few spotlight moments during these past couple years, Capricorn, and this one is your encore. What passion, talent or message have you not expressed? Leave it all on the dance floor—this full moon invites you to put it all out there!\nNot that you have to go overboard to turn heads now. You could attract attention, possibly without trying, and la luna invites you to unleash the glamorous or showy parts of your personality. Let that inner performer out to play! One of your new fans could have romantic potential. And if you’ve been giving all your lovin’ to an undeserving person, the lunar eclipse reminds you just how many (interested) fish are swimming in the sea. Onward and upward!\nShake it off, Capricorn! On October 8, Venus rounds out its extended four-month trip through Leo and your intense, intimate eighth house that began back on June 5. While that might sound like something to hold onto, there’s a good chance this cycle had its complications. After all, Venus was retrograde from July 22 until September 3, which could have caused major jealousy, mixed messages and suspiciousness to flare.\nOn October 8, amorous Venus soars into Virgo and your adventurous ninth house until November 8. Ah, now that’s more like it! Perspective returns and tunnel vision clears up. Venus finds freedom a major turn-on in this part of your chart, so any obsessing will give way to a more balanced view of it all. An attraction to someone of a different culture or background than yours could spark up. For couples, this is a favorable cycle to travel together.\nMeantime, energizing Mars is wrapping up a visit to Libra and your career house in the first half of the month, which spans from August 27 to October 12. You could have a LOT going on at work too, which can make it hard to get into that slow and sensual groove. And “leaving it at the office” won’t be that simple. If the object of your affection happens to be connected to your job, well, that’s just more midnight oil to burn. You could meet someone through a work-related event in the first couple weeks of the month.\nThe lightness from Venus will soon be amplified by her dance partner Mars, however. From October 12 to November 24, Mars will blaze a fiery trail through Scorpio and your eleventh house of friendship and casual connections. Your love life gets stoked by hanging out in groups, whether you meet someone through mutual friends or just bring levity back to your relationship through attending a fun event. Sports games, hayrides, Halloween parties: pick your pumpkin patch poison and take a hearty gulp. A strong dose of Vitamin F (Fun) will be the aphrodisiac you didn’t know you needed quite so badly!\nPlain and simple, October could be one of your most successful periods this year. With the Sun and unstoppable Mars both in Libra (the Sun until October 23, Mars through October 12), your tenth house of career and success is ablaze with energy. \nThrow in the October 14 Libra new moon—a scene-stealing solar eclipse—and opportunity won’t just come knocking; it’ll barge down your door. It won’t take “no” for an answer, so sort through your options with care. It’s not a question of whether you’ll get a great offer, but rather, of which one you’ll accept!\nThe spotlight comes calling at the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse, a day to step out of the shadows and perform your solo act. A creative project, or just your natural talents, could draw attention and even bring fame. Embrace that celebrity status and give your fans the performance they want!\nLove Days: 2, 6\nMoney Days: 13, 23\nLuck Days: 11, 21\nOff Days: 3, 9, 18\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(November 22 - December 21)\nGet out and circulate with your people, Sagittarius! You’re the maestro of every ceremony, at least for the first three weeks of the month while the Sun is in Libra and your social “superconnector” eleventh house. You love playing matchmaker, whether you’re introducing two compatible colleagues or people you think would be a great romantic pairing. \nWith energizer Mars also in Libra until October 12, you’re especially motivated to mix, mingle and become a member of an exciting group. Together, you can go farther faster—and with your ambitious plans, Sagittarius, it definitely takes a village to pull them off. \nThings could happen fast this month because October is eclipse season! On October 14 and 28, two change-making eclipses will light up the skies. Expect the unexpected! The first one, a solar (new moon) eclipse, lands in Libra, adding midmonth momentum to your social network. You could be offered a big opportunity to launch a digital venture, speak at a TEDx conference or join a group of thought leaders. Why NOT you, Sagittarius?\nIf money’s been a source of stress this spring and summer, you may rejoice when alchemical Pluto ends a five-month retrograde on October 10. The other four slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are still retrograde for the whole month of October, giving you some extra space to step back and weigh your decisions, particularly about work, home and your living situation. Take your time to ponder those while freely exploring some new revenue opportunities.\nPower down a little starting October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your twelfth house of closure, rest and healing. But don’t sink too deep into your down comforter yet. Energizer Mars is in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, which will stoke your imagination and creativity. A bedside journal and morning free-writing sessions could yield some true gems. Be sure to capture them!\nOn October 28, the lunar (full moon) eclipse in Taurus brings a two-year eclipse series on your health and healing axis to a close. Your body and well-being have demanded your attention since November 2021. There’s no denying that your relationship to both the physical and spiritual planes has been transformed. If you answered the call, this could be a moment to celebrate! \nTake inventory of your habits then and now. Perhaps you went through a medical odyssey, changed your eating habits or completely revamped your routines with supplements or regular exercise. Whatever the case, you’re graduating from this eclipse period—with all of its highs and lows. Here’s to your continued good health!\nBut first: candy. This Halloween features a moon in your opposite sign of Gemini, which rules your partnership house. Coordinating costumes, anyone? While that’s not typically your style, you might have fun sharing some part of the celebration with a friend or plus-one. Dress up as the left and right hemisphere of the brain or pick your pop culture celebrity duo and do a spooky send-up (zombified Taylor Swift and the ghosts of her dating past?). Most important item on the agenda is that you have some well-deserved fun!\nGather with your people, Archer. The Sun is in Libra and your eleventh house of group activity until October 23, a perfect three-week period to network, entertain and collaborate. Although you’re an independent sign by nature, you need people—and now is the time to put a few key players in place to support your mission. \nWith go-getter Mars also in Libra until October 12, you could be cheered and supported by members of your circle. One or two of them could shuttle your ideas onto the fast track, especially near the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. \nMars adds excitement and stress in equal measure, and you may go into “people overload” at moments, having almost too much of a good thing. Teamwork does indeed make the dream work this month, but you need to have some literal dreams (as in, a good night’s sleep!) to keep your energy levels up. There could be a zillion events, conference calls, video chats and parties to rsvp to, so choose selectively. And be sure to log off those social media sites whenever possible, even if your posts keep going viral!\nMars is in “detriment”—a weakened position—in Libra. After all, the planet of war isn’t terribly comfortable in the sign of peace. It’s all too easy to overestimate what you can handle (a Sagittarius issue by nature). Better to underpromise and overdeliver than the reverse. Manage people’s expectations and be sure to delegate! With Mars in this team-centric zone, you could have a power posse of capable collaborators ready to pitch in. Do your part by giving them clear instructions…then letting go and trusting.\nTension over money could spike on October 8, when Mars locks into a heated square with calculating Pluto in your work and money house. \nGo-getter Mars is blazing through Libra and your eleventh house of teamwork until October 12, catalyzing your collaborations. While it could be stressful to manage a few outsized egos and personalities, you can still triumphantly bring these people together for a shared victory. \nToday, however, it could be challenging to get everyone on the same page. Fights around funding or clashing work styles can culminate in a major ego battle. You may have to step in (or pull yourself out) if things get too heated and volatile. Do you have the confidence to pull off a major project? The answer is yes—but you might need to do some internal fortifying before YOU actually believe it. \nLean on your trusted circle and reliable team members to a point, but remember: They’re not your therapists! Reach out to a coach or trained counselor to do that inner work.\nAny controlling or micromanaging tendencies start to clear up on October 10, when calculating Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde that began on May 1, splitting its time between two signs. Since June 11, Pluto’s been reversing through Capricorn and your second house of work and money. Whew! \nWhile the karmic planet reversed through this zone, it may have driven up old fears and limiting beliefs that impacted your bottom line. From power struggles with co-workers to stressful money fluctuations, conditions haven’t always been favorable for you, Sagittarius. Your confidence may have taken a few hits during this cycle. \nNow, as Pluto returns to forward motion, you can regain a sense of power and get back into the financial driver’s seat. If you’ve been unsure about whether to work with someone or take on a project, Pluto’s course correction can help you make a clear decision. \nGet ready for a spike in your popularity and influence, Sagittarius. On October 14, the year’s only Libra new moon—a boldfaced solar eclipse—beams into your eleventh house of groups and teams. Is it time to join a new crew or catapult a collaboration to greater heights? No need to work overtime because the eclipse is pouring rocket fuel in your tank.\nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016 and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your stardom and your team efforts between March 2023 and March 2025. You’ll learn how to navigate the spotlight as well as delegate to a capable crew. \nSharing power is not always easy for your self-directed sign, to be honest. That’s why these eclipses are here to teach you important lessons about leadership. You don’t have to sacrifice your individuality to be part of a group, but that’s how you’ll learn when it’s time to compromise a little instead of bottle-necking progress. \nToday’s lunar mission: Start stocking your squad with people qualified to go the distance with you. This is a powerful time for networking, and, since this futuristic house rules technology, you could launch an online venture or viral piece of content. An opportunity to commune with a cutting-edge group could catapult one of your visionary ideas into the stratosphere. Team up for the win! \nWith this new moon opposing wounded healer Chiron today, old pain around feeling invisible, ignored or “less than” could flare up. Your ego may need some repair work—or to head to the timeout chair. If you’re craving recognition or yearning for attention, ask yourself: Why do I want it so badly? Painful as it might be to confront the feelings of abandonment or unworthiness that lie beneath, it’s time to shed those already. What if your desire to share a message was really in service of sharing your light and spreading joy? That’s much more of a win-win, Sagittarius, motivated by creativity instead of a feeling of lack.\nPower down starting October 23, when the Sun shifts into Scorpio and your twelfth house of rest and endings. For the next four weeks, the Sun’s low-lit position invites you to slip off the grid as much as possible for self-care and restorative activities. \nShield your field if you step out into a crowd since you’re susceptible to absorbing everyone’s energy. Carry a grounding crystal, bring a wingperson and have a ready excuse if you need to depart early and get some shuteye! \nWith energy planet Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, you’ll definitely need to conserve your resources and get extra rest. You may feel both wired and tired at times. Regulate your nervous system by powering down devices an hour before bedtime, unwinding with a healing sound bath (or bubble bath!) and by nourishing yourself with lots of open calendar space. It may take you longer to bounce back after you exert a lot of energy, so if you work hard, make sure you take twice as much rest as you think you need!\nWellness check! The October 28 Taurus full moon is a partial lunar eclipse, illuminating your sixth house of health, fitness and organization. Before you tuck yourself into bed completely, the celestial spotlight beams onto your practices and habits. Are you being as efficient as you could be? Delegating instead of trying to DIY everything? \nThe sixth house rules helpful people and employees. This full moon can bring a change of the guard on Team Sagittarius. You could hire, fire or meet someone who’d make a rock star assistant. Is it time for a system overhaul? From a deep decluttering to a purge of apps and subscriptions you don’t use, it’s a powerful day to clear your spaces. \nToday’s full moon is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021, revolutionizing your health and healing sectors. Your approach to work, well-being, spirituality and self-care has been radically revamped over the past two years. \nHow are your stress levels? These eclipse helped you find a middle ground between being micromanaging and being checked out. There were moments when your inner control freak got benched, and other times when you needed to snap out of denial and take action. \nToday, this dichotomy is further underscored by your ruler, expansive Jupiter, in Taurus opposing stressful Mars in Scorpio. Rather than bury your head in the sand, it’s a day to finally delegate to the capable and supportive people on Team Sagittarius. An “impossible” situation can be solved with a simple plan—but you don’t have to come up with that alone. Where there’s a will and a willing heart, there’s a way!\nChanging of the guard! For the past four months, romantic Venus has been taking an extended trip through Leo and your expansive, free-spirited ninth house—the zodiac zone that Sagittarius rules. Since this is one of your favorite Venus positions, you were probably one of the signs least affected when Venus turned retrograde from July 22 to September 3.\nStill, it wasn’t exactly screaming “summer lovin’ had me a blast,” Archer. Hopefully you made up for lost time over the past month, with Venus back on track and swaggering through your ninth house of travel, adventure and personal growth. (We spent a chunk of that time eating and greeting our way through Barcelona—so we hope our fellow Sags made equally good use of the transit!)\nStarting October 8, things could take a turn for the serious as Venus moves into Virgo for a month. With the love goddess in your regimented tenth house of long-term goals, you may flip the switch and suddenly want to prioritize some romantic plans before the holidays. Cuffing season could get off to a better-late-than-never start for Archers looking to make things official or strengthen the relationship you’re already in.\nMeanwhile, lusty Mars is powering up your social life as it revs through Libra and your collaborative eleventh house until October 12. For your free-spirited fire sign, this cycle might crank up your needs for independence and autonomy; single Archers might feel like your love life is one grand adventure. The boundary between platonic and passionate could be thin, and things could get romantic with a friend, especially near the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. One tiny word of caution: You might not have the self-restraint to think through potential consequences—but try to anyway.\nOn October 12, no-holds-barred Mars moves into your twelfth house of transitions until November 24, decelerating the energy. This temporary slowdown has a silver lining, though: Mars will next move into Sagittarius, cranking up the holiday heat!\nUntil then, you’re ready to detoxify and downsize. From hauling junk out of the basement to ousting a faux friend from your inner circle, wrap this season with a clean slate. Easy though! With brash Mars egging you on, you could act in haste. (Once you’ve donated the wedding china from your short-lived first marriage to Goodwill, it’s gonna be hard to get back.) If you must say goodbye, do it with compassion—even if you’re done for good. \nTeam efforts are the fastest route to success this month, thanks to the Sun, Mars and an October 14 solar eclipse in Libra and your collaborative eleventh house. There’s no question you can go ten times as far when you join up with a supportive squad. \nDon’t be afraid to speak up and ask for what you need. With assertive Mars here until October 12, the key is being direct yet diplomatic. This will take extra finesse when working with a team. Err on the side of politeness at all times, Sag. At the October 14 eclipse, you could be invited to join an elite or avant-garde crew, perhaps one with a humanitarian twist. Membership has its privileges indeed!\nBut don’t forgot those humble roots—not that you ever would. The October 28 Taurus full moon, a powerful lunar eclipse, illuminates your sixth house of employees and organization. Delegate, systematize and maybe hire some help. Be sure to thank the supportive people who helps you get where you are today. If someone on Team Sagittarius is no longer a fit, this eclipse could be your cue to amicably part ways and wish each other well.\nLove Days: 27, 3\nMoney Days: 11, 21\nLuck Days: 9, 18\nOff Days: 2, 6, 14\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

The first three weeks of the month could be a little bumpy—but they’ll be easier if you find the courage to surrender instead of clinging to control. Resistance is futile anyhow. With two changemaking eclipses sweeping through the skies on October 14 and 28, this month will pry away anything that no longer serves you. The good news? They’ll clear a space for you to step into something even better and more genuinely suited to the person you’ve become.\nConserve your energy while the Sun is in Libra and your restful, foggy twelfth house through October 23. Energizer Mars is also in Libra until October 12, which could push you to the verge of burnout if you rush to the save and try to extinguish every little fire. You’ll pass through the eye of the needle on October 14, when a Libra solar (new moon) eclipse—the first one since 2016—brings a moment of spiritual awakening and serendipity. Allow the divine guidance to lead you instead of trying to force an outcome.\nOn October 10, your ruling planet Pluto will wake up from a five-month retrograde, moving forward in Capricorn and your communication zone. Have you felt ignored, undervalued or misunderstood a lot over the summer? Pick up the mic again, Scorpio. Your words will have more potency, and your genius ideas will be recognized. \nYour co-ruler Mars will amplify this Pluto power. From October 12 until November 24, the red planet will blaze through Scorpio for its biennial visit. It’s as if an inner light was turned on and suddenly the world is responding to your confidence and charisma. Ah, now that’s more like it! \nWhen the Sun moves into Scorpio on October 23, it will team up with Mars for the next four weeks. You might have moments where you feel outright invincible! But pace yourself just the same. We’re still waiting for four of the slow-moving outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—to end their retrogrades, and that won’t start happening until next month. All of these planets are in parts of your chart related to romance and relationships. Proceed with caution before making anything official. \nThere’s even more wisdom to taking it slow with your dynamic duos. Eclipses come in pairs, and the second one is on October 28 in Taurus, your opposite sign. It’s the grand finale of a Taurus/Scorpio eclipse series that began November 2021. Over the past two years, these eclipses have revolutionized your approach to both personal identity and relationships. You’ve stepped into new roles and shed connections that aren’t a fit. Now it’s graduation day!\nTake a little break, Scorpio. The Sun is in savasana until October 23, journeying through Libra and your twelfth house of rest, closure and healing. Slip off the radar for the first three weeks of the month—as much as you possibly can—and prioritize activities that replenish your mental, emotional and spiritual tanks. From meditating and spending time in nature (especially near water) to dancing and listening to music: Choose your escape route and float away!\nBut note to Scorpios: Powering down won’t be easy with energizer Mars in Libra, disrupting this normally Zen zone until October 12. Mars is in “detriment” here, its least comfortable sign to visit. It makes sense: Mars is the warrior planet and Libra is the sign of peace. As a result, the uneasy combo can make it hard to chill out. People will be passive-aggressive, even whiny, and you might find yourself tossing and turning over stressful thoughts. \nOn October 12 Mars will move into Scorpio until November 24, amping you up even more. Put in extra measures to power down at night, enforcing a strict “devices and lights off” deadline and having supportive people (whether friends, therapists or healers) lined up if you’re processing any heavy emotions or confronting some grief that you pushed aside. \nWith a solar eclipse in Libra stirring up old wounds midmonth, you might as well surrender: This is your chance to heal and deal. Silver lining? By the time Scorpio season rolls around, you’ll have gotten a lot of the heavy-duty emotions out of your system!\nWatch your words on October 8, when your co-rulers, penetrating Pluto and combative Mars, lock into a heated square. With Pluto in your communication sector and Mars in your twelfth house of hidden agendas, this day could crank up the gossip mill and bring passive-aggressive people out of left field. \nEvade the shade by knowing that people are likely to lure you into drama—and it’s your job to not take that bait! Be careful not to push anyone’s buttons or prey on their sensitive spots, even unintentionally. Stick to neutral topics and save the conflict-resolution efforts for another day.\nClear your throat and speak, Scorpio! On October 10, transformational and karmic Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde, which began May 1 in Aquarius and your fourth house of home and family. Since June 11, Pluto’s been reversing through Capricorn and your third house of expression, community and media. Messages may have gotten scrambled—or totally lost—during this retrograde. You’ve been pushed to do a LOT of thinking about how you articulate ideas and engage with others.\nCommunication has been an ongoing issue for you to transform and improve for the past few years as Pluto makes its lengthy, once-in-a-lifetime journey through Capricorn from 2008 to 2024. You’ve already learned HUGE lessons about how to interact impactfully with others and when to trust someone enough to forge a friendship or creative collaboration. \nSince summer, many Scorpios have struggled to get their point across—and Mercury’s recent retrograde from August 23 to September 15 didn’t help! Old fears, some driven by shame and anxiety, may have created blocks in key relationships. As Pluto corrects course, you’ll be better able to smooth out dicey dynamics. And during this psyche-probing October, you can get down to the root cause, which will help you make lasting change.\nThe October 14 Libra new moon—a potent solar eclipse—sweeps into your twelfth house of healing, closure and fantasy. On the positive side, this can be a beautiful moment for creativity and spirituality. It can also abruptly shut one door and catapult you through another. Eclipses can deliver swift changes that don’t leave us much time to react. Clinging onto something that’s past its prime will be futile.\nHave you been holding a grudge that’s eating at YOU? This new moon eclipse invites you to commence any necessary forgiveness or amends-making process. Trade that resentment for radical acceptance. You can’t change the past, but you CAN make better choices for the future. Protect your own boundaries and let yourself be vulnerable and open again. \nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your health and healing sectors between March 2023 and March 2025. \nThis new moon is also opposite healer-feeler Chiron. A spiritual or artistic endeavor gets a boost from these moonbeams, and projects you begin now will blossom in the coming six months. Your efforts to release an emotional block may feel painful or laborious now, but by next spring, any hard inner work you do will also pay dividends in the form of more serenity. Take the first steps to reclaim your equilibrium.\nGreat news: Scorpio season shifts into gear on October 23, flipping the lights back on. After an intense and internally focused month, it’s time for some action! Pace yourself because even as your confidence and can-do spirit return, you could easily over do it. Prioritize passion projects for the next four weeks while your solo endeavors get a special hit of solar power.\nWith Mars blazing through Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, your powers of persuasion will be unstoppable! No more burying your head in the sand and ignoring your deepest personal desires. Put your most cherished dreams on the front burner, whether that’s starting your own business or committing to a personal goal. Do what Scorpios do best: Radar in on what you want and block out all distractions.\nOn October 28, the year’s only Taurus full moon, a partial lunar eclipse, will catalyze your seventh house of committed partnerships. A budding connection, either romantic or business, could turn official at lightning speed. On the other hand, a contract or collaboration might end, or it could turn in an unexpected new direction. If any relationship in your life could use some revolutionizing, this full moon eclipse is make sure that happens!\nEclipses, especially lunar ones, can abruptly turn the tides, whether you want that to happen or not. Today’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. Your relationships AND your personal growth have both soared into new dimensions over the past couple years. And if you took the “moon medicine,” you should know thyself like never before. \nThe eclipses also helped you reshuffle the balance between “me” and “we,” teaching you when you needed individuate and when it was better to partner up. With Mars in Scorpio opposing expansive Jupiter in Taurus today, you may feel the dichotomy even more acutely. Where are you giving too much at the expense of your own needs? Where might you be acting selfishly instead of collaborating and sharing power? Take one last deeply honest look at this today, Scorpio.\nHow about a little lightness back in your love life? That starts to happen as October rolls on, and not a moment too soon.\nOn October 8, Venus rounds out its extended four-month trip through Leo and your tenth house of long-term goals that began back on June 5. While there were some opportunities to get on the same page about the future, there were also a few interruptions. Venus was in a tricky retrograde cycle from July 22 until September 3, disrupting your summer flow. \nMeanwhile, Mars has been in Libra and your foggy, low-energy twelfth house since August 27, dragging its heels through this realm until October 12. On the plus side, this is the realm of fantasy, and you may have had a few sexy encounters. However, they may have come with a side of mixed messages or uncertainty, layered with angst around which direction to take. \nIf you were able to find your center through the cacophony, you might have had a major breakthrough in the past month, especially since Venus turned direct. One Scorpio we know got engaged after a relatively short courtship. “When you know, you know,” he assured us.\nWhatever the case, any mishaps or misgivings all start coming out in the wash starting October 8. That day, Venus moves into Virgo and your indie-spirited eleventh house until November 8. If you’re not happily hooked up, you may feel more experimental about dating, perhaps considering a long-distance or open relationship or seeing multiple people more or less simultaneously.\nThis is a great cycle for getting out and hanging with friends and not being so serious about love. You may be hard to pin down—if one can even find you—and attracted to people who think outside the box and aren’t afraid to pursue their grandest visions. If you’re in a relationship (or trying to be), Venus in Virgo gives you the courage to be more playfully authentic about your desires. \nBut things really blast off on October 12, when red-hot Mars blazes into Scorpio, cranking up the heat, passion and your famously magnetic sex appeal. Carpe diem! This passionate planet only visits your sign every two years, and you’ll have its energizing presence at your disposal until November 24. You’ll also have plenty of momentum for a personal project, which could turn into a cult of personality with you at its epicenter. Suddenly, you’ll flip from feeling invisible and irrelevant to the hottest thing in town. Enjoy the wave of confidence and charisma, and ride it through to the holiday season! \nConserve your energy this month, Scorpio, at least for the first two weeks. Energy planet Mars is in Libra and your twelfth house of rest and closure until October 12, alongside the Sun (here until October 23). There’s also a solar eclipse in Libra on October 14, which could finalize the loose ends of a lingering life chapter. Focus the lion’s share of your energy on wrapping up any unfinished projects and balancing that out with lots of self-care. If you can slip off for a short sabbatical (even the three-day-weekend kind), do it. \nYour motivation will return with a vengeance once Scorpio season begins on October 23. But it could ramp up even sooner as go-getter Mars starts the Scorpio soiree, visiting your sign from October 12 to November 24. Get ready: You’ll bring new meaning to the concept of finishing the year strong!\nWhen the Taurus lunar eclipse ignites your partnership house on October 28, you could ink a deal or team up with a complementary collaborator for an even bigger win. This is a huge moment, as this supercharged full moon is also the final installment in an eclipse series that’s spent the last two-years traveling over the Taurus/Scorpio axis. It hasn’t been the easiest time, as it’s been filled with major growth and important life lessons. But you did it! You rose to the challenge and here you are. Reflect back on the person you’ve become since November 2021, Scorpio, and prepare to be amazed.\nLove Days: 25, 2\nMoney Days: 9, 18\nLuck Days: 6, 14\nOff Days: 27, 3, 13\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(February 19 - March 20)\nA little privacy, please? For the first three weeks of the month, your introspective side takes hold, pulling you into the depths of your emotions. With the Sun in Libra and your eighth house of intimacy and investments until October 23, you have a narrow focus and could be preoccupied with people and projects that consume your attention. Intensifier Mars is also in Libra until October 12, and on October 14, eclipse season begins with a Libra solar (new moon) eclipse—the first of this month’s changemaking duo. \nEclipses come in pairs, and the October 14 eclipse is the first one to land in Libra since 2016. It’s part of a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that’s revolutionizing your approach to money, self-worth and joint ventures. Your most important ties could be revolutionized, and your values and priorities might undergo big shifts. \nThe second eclipse arrives on October 28, and it’s a full moon (lunar) eclipse in Taurus. This one will impact your social life and the way you express yourself. As it beams into your third house of communication, you could get long-awaited news or a surprising message. This is the grand finale of an eclipse series that began in November 2021, touching down in Taurus and Scorpio and revolutionizing communication, learning, travel and your role in the community.\nEclipses can bring sudden changes, shifting alliances and curveball news. For that reason, you might be glad that all of the slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) are in low-power retrogrades this month. It will give you a chance to process! \nThe one exception is on October 10, when transformational Pluto corrects course and turns direct (forward) in Capricorn and your eleventh house of friendship and teamwork. If power struggles have disrupted a group dynamic or your social circle’s gotten shadier than a Bridgerton scandal sheet, the drama will start to die down. \nPerspective returns starting October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your adventurous, optimistic ninth house for a month. Pull yourself out of tunnel vision and go reconnect with the wider world. Make travel plans, follow your natural curiosity about a topic, explore a business startup idea. Let your visionary side out to play now, Pisces. \nDive into those mermaidy depths, Pisces. October always starts out as an intense and introspective time for you as the Sun makes its annual rounds through Libra and your private eighth house until October 22. You’re not exactly eager to be in the limelight now, especially with energy planet Mars also in Libra until October 12. Swim under the radar as often as you can. This is an excellent time for behind-the-scenes work, intensive research and focused tasks you can do without distraction.\nThe eighth house rules merging, and this solar cycle can strengthen your bonds with the innermost members of Team Pisces. You don’t have to isolate yourself or struggle alone—in fact, please DON’T do that. If you’re grappling with something complex and confounding, reach out for support from trusted people, whether friends or a professional, such as a therapist or energy worker. Real estate, long-term finances and other assets also fall under the eighth-house domain, so use this month to assess your plans and make sure you’re properly set up for the future.\nFrom investments and shared finances to engagements and pregnancies, the Sun in this perma-linking zone has you evaluating all your closest alliances—and how far you want to go together. Libra season could spark a strong mind-body-spirit attraction to someone, so keep your antennae up for a sexy soulmate or, if you’re in a relationship, for ways to deepen your intimacy. \nWatch your temper on October 8, when a volatile square forms between Mars and powermonger Pluto, which is in Capricorn and your eleventh house of teamwork and technology. Jealousy could erupt between friends, or a simmering rivalry might reach a meltdown point. Do your best to stay out of the controversy. Attempts to mediate may backfire, so let the drama queens and divas settle their own issues without you! \nIf you have to protect any legal rights or intellectual property, that’s a different story. (You’ll still need to stay out of the low-vibe conflict, though.) Call an attorney and handle your strategy on the downlow instead of getting sucked into any interpersonal scuffles. This square could also crank up some sexy tension with a friend or co-worker. Think VERY carefully before crossing that line.\nOn October 10, karmic powerhouse Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde nap, powering forward in Capricorn and your eleventh house of groups and teams. A stalled collaboration could pick up speed, and you may find group dynamics improving (hooray!), especially if tension has been simmering beneath the surface. \nEarlier this year, yous social circle may have gotten an upgrade. Associating with a more mature and ambitious crowd is paying off for you, and Pluto’s course correction could turn a few of those folks into powerful allies who can open doors. \nA mind-body-soul connection could turn into a sizzling fall romance, especially near the October 14 Libra new moon—a potent solar eclipse—which sends fresh-start signals into your intimate eighth house. The eighth house rules permanent bonds, from marriage to cohabitation to any way you might join your life with another person’s. Maybe the connection is more of a business spark, but it will ignite with equal fervor at this eclipse. \nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your money, intimacy and investments zones between March 2023 and March 2025. \nThe eighth house rules shared finances and investments, making this a great time to explore ways you can multiply your moolah. The solar eclipse could serve up an opportunity to join forces with a well-connected VIP. Could you merge your superpowers for mutual gain? With healer-feeler Chiron opposite the new moon, you may have to do some deeper inner work to get to the root of any blocks. \nYour perspective widens on October 23, when the Sun shifts into Scorpio and your ninth house of adventure, travel and expanded horizons. All that deep reflection of the past month will yield a refreshing wider-angle view of the world. \nYou could also adopt a traveler’s mindset closer to home, looking at your current situation in a completely new and exploratory light. Perhaps you’ll sign up for a mind-expanding workshop or teach one yourself. Or maybe you’ll master that foreign language you’ve only flirted with thus far, either in a class or with an app like Duolingo. \nThe actions you take are less important than your mindset: When it comes to realizing your wildest dreams, think big, Pisces. Got an idea for a business you could launch? Go-getter Mars will also join the Sun in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, making you extra pumped to explore your entrepreneurial side. \nOn October 28, the year’s only Taurus full moon is a partial lunar eclipse, igniting your third house of communication and community. An idea that’s been percolating since the corresponding Taurus new moon on May 19 could reach an exciting turning point. Have you been waiting for news or a green light on a project? It could come—and faster than you expected! \nMake sure you’re camera and microphone ready. Your opinion could be in high demand today. Record a podcast or an Instagram Reel if you’ve got the irrepressible urge to speak out. Stand up and share at the meeting. Take the plunge and be honest with friends instead of saying everything’s “fine.”\nThe energy is especially kinetic today because it’s the grand finale of a two-year eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. You’ve been finding your voice, speaking your truth and clarifying your message ever since. Assertive Mars (in Scorpio) is also opposite outspoken Jupiter (in Taurus) today. You might find that once you open up that can of truth serum, there’s a whole lot more in there than you expected!\nCosmic cuffing season arrives with serious intention this month! On October 8, Venus will cruise into Virgo and your seventh house of partnership until November 8. If the balance in a key connection feels off-kilter, these next three weeks provide an opening for talking it out and finding a workable compromise. \nSingle Pisces should lean into your natural gift of gab for attracting someone with LTR potential. Sultry conversation is the best aphrodisiac! Don’t be surprised if a meeting of the minds quickly turns into a linking of the hearts too.\nYou may have some lingering tension to clear as Venus finally exits Leo and your stressful sixth house after an extended four-month visit. Since June 5, life has felt mired in the practical more than the magical—not the preferred ratio for you, Pisces. And to make matters worse, Venus was retrograde in Leo from July 22 to September 3, putting a damper on the sweet summer lovin’ you look forward to every year. \nGrrr! Use this new Venus in Virgo monthlong cycle to get back in sync with your closest people—and yourself—and to bring balance back to your bonds.\nEmotions could still be intense for the first half of October, running the gamut from jealousy and obsessiveness to a passion that’s burning so strong you can’t even think about the outcome. That’s because Mars is wrapping a visit to Libra and your intense, intimate eighth house that began on August 27. With Mars in this heat zone until October 12, lust or anger can override common sense. Make sure to have plenty of healthy outlets to prevent a reactive meltdown and a messy cleanup job.\nYour fun-loving side returns on October 12, when the randy red planet relocates to Scorpio and your expansive ninth house until November 24. Mars in this big-picture zone will snap you out of tunnel vision and help you see all the amorous options and adventures that await. \nSwim up to the surface, Pisces, and have a look around! With your wanderlust fired up, too many cozy days at home could make you feel claustrophobic. Poke through the travel sites and make some calls, even if the website says the place is fully booked for the holiday season. You might as well get on the waitlist. Under this spontaneous surge, hopping a last-minute flight isn’t too far out of reach. \nAnd if you can’t get away, bring the action and adventure close to home. With your vivid imagination, a sexy staycation should be easy to plan—whether it’s for yourself or shared with a playful plus-one. \nInvest and inspect! With the Sun in Libra until October 23 and go-getter Mars here through October 12, this is a powerful period to examine your financial and wealth-building efforts through a microscope. Libra rules your laser-focused eighth house, the realm of joint ventures, research and large lump sums. \nYou’ve got the stamina for those nitty-gritty details—and you could make a compelling pitch for a shared business endeavor, especially at the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. Get things in order and you could welcome a windfall!\nExciting news could arrive with the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse, which spotlights your communication house and attracts kindred spirits and helpful collaborators. Make your announcement, drop your new product, tell the world what you’ve been up to these past few months!\nLove Days: 6, 11\nMoney Days: 18, 27\nLuck Days: 14, 25\nOff Days: 9, 13\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Aquarius Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:09", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(January 20 - February 18)\nThink big—no, bigger, Aquarius! October is your most visionary month, when your ambitions are amplified and you feel like everything’s possible for you. With two game-changing eclipses lighting up the skies on October 14 and October 28, change is happening whether you want it to or not. \nRide the wave. These eclipses could bring an unexpected business opportunity or living situation. Buying a home, moving or a change in your family could be on the agenda at the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse especially. That one is the grand finale of a two-year eclipse series on the Taurus/Scorpio axis that’s been making major waves in your personal AND professional endeavors. You could close out October with big decisions in both areas.\nBut for now, there’s a wide world to explore! The Sun is soaring through Libra and your ninth house of expansion, travel and adventure until October 23, a time when you feel like anything’s possible—and hey, why shouldn’t you? This buoyant starmap is further amped up by energizer Mars, which is making its biennial blast through Libra until October 12. \nYou could give any motivational speaking guru a run for their “idea evangelist” money with this cosmic lineup, especially near the October 14 Libra new moon solar eclipse. From launching a startup to returning to school to publishing your ideas, this eclipse presses down hard on the “share” button and inspires you to put yourself out there in a big way.\nWhether you realize it or not, your subconscious has been gathering a lot of wisdom and creative capital over the spring and summer. Shadowy Pluto ends a five-month retrograde on October 10 that began in your sign on May 1, then slipped back into Capricorn and your imaginative, healing twelfth house on June 11. You could emerge from this soul-searching period with many gifts to share. \nThe other four slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) remain retrograde for the whole month, giving you space to ponder matters of money, home and family at a gentler pace. Don’t rush into decisions if you can help it—but know that the eclipses may force your hand despite these cosmic cycles.\nScorpio season sweeps in on October 23 and revs up your ambitious, professional tenth house. With motivator Mars energizing this career corner of your chart from October 12 to November 24, the last quarter of 2023 could be a lucrative one. Why not end the year with a success story, Aquarius? \nHalloween could be filled with tricks AND treats thanks to the moon in Gemini and your playful, passionate fifth house. Feel free to make it a spicy night for romance. But watch out for jealous vibes and masked intentions as the moon squares off against Venus in Virgo and your secretive eighth house. Maybe you’ll sneak off with a sexy costumed cutie—but screen them for skeletons in the closet and ghosting tendencies before you get swept away.\nSpread your wings, Water Bearer! The Sun is blazing through Libra and your expansive ninth house until October 23, giving you a wide-angle view on life and emboldening you to take risks—creatively, emotionally and in every way. \nFor your future-forward sign, who’s happiest when you have something big to look forward to, Libra season might be one of your favorite times of year. With your mind so open to new possibilities, you’ll be able to take advantage of those spontaneous moments that can lead to new friendships and adventures. Follow your curiosity, Aquarius, and see where it takes you.\nEvery two years, Mars arrives to ramp up your excitement to triple-exclamation-point levels—and here it is! Until October 12, the red planet will ride shotgun with el Sol, heating up your enthusiasm even more. If you can slip in a getaway, even for a weekend, this month would be ideal. You want anything but “business as usual” now, making this a stellar time to launch an indie business, sign up for a workshop or class, or to expand your mind by exploring new metaphysical ideas. Shift your perspective on the world and watch yourself attract a whole different set of results. \nOne day to lay low arrives on October 8, when rash Mars locks into a volatile square with subterranean Pluto. Mars in your outspoken and expansive ninth house can tempt you to make a blunt comment or take a big risk that you haven’t totally thought through. \nWith shadowy Pluto playing the blame game, you could be undermined at every turn. Someone may turn your words around on you or punish you for a misstep. You might be pointing fingers instead of taking responsibility for your actions. Catch yourself if you’re doing that, Aquarius. Where can you take the high road here instead of getting dragged into drama or defensiveness?\nCome out of the fog, Aquarius. On October 10, karmic Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde, powering forward in Capricorn and your twelfth house of sacrifice and endings. This could be a bit like a bear rousing from hibernation—you don’t know if he’ll be grumpy and reactive or just groggy enough to seem harmless. Similarly, your own energy could be a bit erratic for the next couple days, especially with an eclipse coming.\nPluto’s been retrograde since May 1, and the first six weeks of its backspin (until June 11) it was in Aquarius—a new 20-year phase that we got a sneak preview of in March and April and where it will return to in earnest next year. Until then, you have a few loose ends to wrap up!\nSince June 11, Pluto’s been back-spinning through your zone of healing and closure. Some Aquarians weathered a loss or were plunged into the depths of emotions you might not have wanted to deal with. Perhaps you did some important forgiveness work or faced up to an addictive pattern. If you’ve been forcing an outcome and swimming upstream, Pluto retrograde was a time to STOP pushing an agenda. \nThe only way to free yourself from suffering is to practice radical acceptance—to the best of your human ability. That might get easier now with Pluto direct. Other important lessons from the retrograde? Allowing others to support you and for things to unfold in their own time. Now you’ll start to see that tough inner work pay off. \nWhere would you like to be six months from now? And what horizon-broadening experiences do you want to have between now and then? At the October 14 Libra new moon, start putting plans into action. This new moon, which falls in your visionary and risk-taking ninth house, is also a solar eclipse—the first one we’ve seen in Libra since 2016! \nBig ideas could turn into reality quickly, so fasten your seat belt. Get some bucket-list goals on the agenda, from launching a startup venture to visiting a dream destination. The ninth house rules travel, study and entrepreneurship. Don’t limit yourself—explore all possibilities during this blue-sky month without holding back! \nThis eclipse is part of a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your zones of communication, local events and long-distance connections between March 2023 and March 2025. Influential people can enter your life from far away and right down the street in your homegrown community. Keep an open mind (and door) to all possibilities.\nGot some emotional repair work to do around your confidence and using your voice? The new moon will also be opposite healer-feeler Chiron in Aries and your communication house. Reminder, Aquarius: You have something important to say, and people want (need) to hear it! Telling your own story can be transformational to someone else who’s going through a similar struggle now. Share generously—you never know who you might touch. \nCareer becomes your focus starting October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your tenth house of ambition and professional goals. What would you like to accomplish over the next month, before the holidays kick into high gear? \nIf excess and hedonism sent your life a bit off the rails over the past three weeks, you can corral things into more of a structure during this disciplined time. Or if you’ve had a million “ahh-mazing” ideas, you can now sort the winners from the duds and get to work on building those out. \nGo-getter Mars is blazing through Scorpio too from October 12 to November 24. You can make serious strides to the top for the rest of the year. Align yourself with power players and well-connected people or tap a mentor who can show you the ropes and save you from wasting valuable time and energy!\nBut take a break from being “all business” on October 28 and make time for home, hearth and heartfelt bonds. The annual Taurus full moon is a partial lunar eclipse, landing in your domestic and sentimental fourth house. The spotlight is on personal matters, so take a deeper look at your emotions. If you’re thinking of moving, buying or selling property or expanding your brood, this full moon could set things in motion.\nToday’s full moon is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. For the past two years, major momentum has come to your living situation and your career. One Aquarius we know moved four times; another was promoted to an executive role, only to be recruited for an even better gig six months later! Yet another Aquarius relocated to a suburb and separated from her partner for a short term, who later moved back in on a part-time basis, and, well, they’re still figuring it all out. \nSuch is life with eclipses in these important zones of your chart! You may feel the split between your work and non-work life acutely today because intense Mars in Scorpio is facing off in opposition to expansive Jupiter in Taurus. Demands are coming from all directions, and you might wish you could clone yourself several times over. \nBut the goal here, Aquarius, is to feel less fragmented and more integrated. Pay attention to the signs the eclipse is sending you instead of trying to control everything with your mind. Allow the universe—and the people in your world—to support you! In order for them to do that, you have to open up a little, sink into your heart, and admit that you don’t have all the answers. Good news: None of us do, so you’ll be in good company with the other 8.1 billion people on this planet.\nPartnerships: getting back on track! On October 8, Venus rounds out its extended four-month trip through Leo and your committed relationship house that began back on June 5. While that sounds like a dream for lovestruck Water Bearers, this fortunate cycle was disrupted for six whole weeks when Venus turned retrograde. From July 22 to September 3, there was static, if not constant disconnection, on the line. While things have been clearing up over the past month, you could still feel some lingering tension.\nOn October 8, Venus sails into Virgo and your smoldering eighth house until November 8, making for one scintillating and sexy month! Lower the blinds, queue up the slow jams. Your inner siren comes out to play as amorous Venus slips into this erotic zone. Boudoir fun and games are high on your priority list. \nSnuggling up in bed is a great place to start, so find room in your calendar for intimate connection. Do little things to get yourself in the mood. Upgrade your lingerie collection, commit to regular yoga practice, meditate each morning to shift into a state that is relaxed, receptive and ready to get close.\nThat might not happen until October 12, when lusty Mars moves into Scorpio (more on that in a minute). Until then, the randy red planet is burning through your freedom-loving and expansive ninth house, where it’s been since August 27. You may feel more experimental about dating, perhaps considering a long-distance or open relationship or seeing multiple people more or less simultaneously.\nBut starting October 12, your tune changes. Mars will move into Scorpio and your tenth house of long-term goals and serious endeavors until November 24. Now, you’ll want to know where things are headed. Where you were okay keeping things in the undefined realm, suddenly, you’ll feel the need to have clarity and direction. Keep in mind that this sudden change could give the other party in your situationship whiplash. Make sure you don’t start issuing demands and directives out of nowhere! \nFor happily coupled Aquarians, the early holiday season could be an amazing time for some VIP dates and parties. RSVP “yes” and have fun dressing to impress (and express), then going out and turning heads together.\nBring on the blue-sky visions! Your ninth house of expansion, entrepreneurship and higher learning is the area of emphasis as the Sun visits Libra until October 23, joined by unstoppable Mars through October 12. The October 14 Libra solar (new moon) eclipse could set the stage for you to turn one of those dreams into reality. \nBig plans and priorities start taking shape in the second half of October. On October 12, motivator Mars blazes into Scorpio and heats up your ambitious tenth house of career and professional moves.  Until then, allow yourself to entertain possibilities far outside your usual scope. \nLove Days: 3, 9\nMoney Days: 14, 25\nLuck Days: 13, 23\nOff Days: 6, 11, 21\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

Swift is longtime friends with Lively and has seemingly been supporting Sophie Turner this past month as she faces divorce proceedings and a custody battle with her ex-partner, Joe Jonas.\nMahomes and Swift appear to have recently become better acquainted since the Eras Tour star attended a Kansas City Chiefs game last weekend. Mahomes is married to the Chiefs' quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, and Swift has reportedly been on a few dates with his teammate Travis Kelce. Swift's appearance at the game at Arrowhead Stadium alongside Kelce's mother cause quite a frenzy amidst Swifties and NFL fans.\nFor the night out in NYC, Swift wore a spaghetti strap minidress in black with a belt at the waist and a pair of strappy sandal heels. She had a black handbag on a long strap and a pendant around her neck. The Midnights singer swept her hair up into a bun with tendrils around her face and wore her signature red lipstick.\nLively went with more of a layered fall look, wearing a multi-colored pencil skirt by MOTHER. She paired it with a beige crop top and a tweed jacket over her shoulders and had on suede knee-high brown boots.\nTurner arrived a bit later in a rich red-brown leather two-piece composed of a mini skirt and long sleeved jacket. She wore it with knee-high black leather boots and carried a small matching purse on a gold chain.\nMahomes wore black leather pants with a white t-shirt and an over-sized jacket made from black and gray leather with white piping, and a pair of black boots.\nSwift and Mahomes became friendly at the afterparty for the game last weekend, and it's rumored Swift will attend the Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets on Sunday night.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

The dramatic skirt trailed along the red carpet in a long train while the bodice was composed of minimal fabric, forming a string bikini-style shape around her bust. \nShe wore the gown with black platform heels and accessorized with a gold pendant necklace studded with diamonds, her gold septum piercing, and a few rings. The Black Widow actress had her short platinum hair slicked back away from her face with a slight finger wave. Her makeup was a natural palette with pale pink lips and a smokey eye.\nPugh loves Valentino and sultry looks that display her figure. In 2022, she wore another Valentino piece in Rome that caused some controversy because of its see-through top. She told ELLE UK that she likes clothes that show her as she is.\n“I'm not trying to hide the cellulite on my thigh,” she stated. “I speak the way I do about my body because I'm not trying to hide the cellulite on my thigh or the squidge in between my arm and my boob: I would much rather lay it all out....I think the scariest thing for me are the instances where people have been upset that I've shown ‘too much’ of myself.”\nShe added, “When everything went down with the Valentino pink dress a year ago, my nipples were on display through a piece of fabric, and it really wound people up...It's the freedom that people are scared of; the fact I'm comfortable and happy. Keeping women down by commenting on their bodies has worked for a very long time.”\n“I think we're in this swing now where lots of people are saying, ‘I don't give a sh-t,’” she continued. “Unfortunately, we've become so terrified of the human body that we can't even look at my two little cute nipples behind fabric in a way that isn't sexual...We need to keep reminding everybody that there is more than one reason for women's bodies [to exist].”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "All About Alexander ‘A.E.’ Edwards, Cher’s Rumored Back-On Boyfriend", "date": "2023-10-01 16:46:00", "text": "Cher's relationship with Alexander “A.E.” Edwards seems to be heating back up. On December 25, 2022, the musical icon shared a photo on Twitter of a giant diamond ring in a pear shape being held by Edwards, displaying the jewelry box and his flame manicure design.  \n“THERE R NO WORDS,” Cher wrote in the caption, adding, “ALEXANDER, A.E.”\nTHERE R NO WORDS,ALEXANDER,A.E pic.twitter.com/TZOYLGVWkv\nIt seemed like an engagement is being strongly implied here, but a few hours later, Cher posted the pic again, saying coyly that she posted it “cause his nails are so cool.”\nI posted this cause his nails are so cool pic.twitter.com/aeUOOy4IIE\nIn May 2023, TMZ reported that the couple broke up weeks before after six months of dating and were never even engaged. Then, in mid-September 2023, they were reported to be exploring their relationship again.\nGiven all that history, here’s what is known about Edwards.\nEdwards is the VP of A&R at Def Jam Records, and is known for his relationship with model and reality star Amber Rose. He and Rose got together in 2018, and had a son in 2019, who they named Slash Electric Alexander Edwards. They broke up in 2021.\nUs Weekly reported on September 18, 2023 that they were exploring reconciliation. “They had stayed in communication even though they called things off a few months ago,” the source said. “They’ve reached a point where they want to give things a second try. They’re not officially back together yet, but they’re enjoying spending time together again and they make each other happy.” The pair was photographed out together days before, on September 15.\nThen, during Paris Fashion Week, they made several appearances out together in the city. On Friday, September 28, they arrived at the Costes Hotel together in coordinated ensembles. Cher was wearing black leather over a matching satin dress. Edwards sported a black tuxedo jacket, over a white button-down, and he also had platinum locks. That same day they were photographed at the Givenchy show, again coordinated in black.\nOn Sunday, October 1, they were seen arriving together at the Valentino show, this time with Cher wearing her hair black.\nCher started tweeting about Edwards in November 2022, sharing heart emojis and pics of him to her fans. They were spotted holding hand in Los Angeles that same month. The 77-year-old singer and 37-year-old artist apparently met in September 2022 at Paris Fashion Week.\nAlexander♥️ pic.twitter.com/o8tH1F0Th6\nCher said in a tweet that Edwards approached her. \n“He’s 36 & In End He Came after me,Till we met in the middle.He’s Consistent one ,I’m The Skittish one. We love each other…. LADIES NEVER GIVE UP,” she wrote.\nLater, she discussed their relationship on The Kelly Clarkson Show, addressing the age gap.\n“On paper it’s kind of ridiculous but in real life we get along great,” she said. “He’s fabulous, and I don’t give men qualities that they don’t deserve. But he’s very kind, he’s very smart. He’s very talented and he’s really funny so, and I think he’s quite handsome.”\nShe added, “If I hadn’t met younger men in my life I would’ve never had a date...Older men just didn’t like me all that much. ... Younger men don’t care if you’re, you know, funny or outrageous and want to do stupid things and you have a strong personality. I’m not giving up my personality for anybody.”\nSources close to the couple told TMZ on May 1, 2023 that Cher and Edwards broke up quietly weeks before. The exact reason wasn’t disclosed, but the sources revealed they were never actually engaged. Edwards had just gotten Cher a diamond ring for the holidays, and they went along with engagement speculation for fun.\nThe Moonstruck star was married to the late Sonny Bono from 1964 to 1975, and then to Gregg Allman from 1975 to 1979. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber Reportedly Did Not Dine Together at Same Paris Restaurant", "date": "2023-10-01 18:35:00", "text": "A few days ago, Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez were seen entering and leaving the same restaurant in Paris as the city flooded with celebrities for Fashion Week. Fans of both immediately went wild, speculating on possible interactions between the two. However, TMZ reports that while they both stopped in at L'Avenue, they did not dine together and were even on different floors of the venue. \nTo add to the speculation, the model and The Only Murders In the Building star were both seen at the same fashion after-party, which was also attended by Kendall Jenner and Nicola Peltz. Once again, they reportedly did not interact.\nSome of the confusion is linked to a viral TikTok insinuating a secret meet up.\nGomez is frequently linked to the Rhode founder even when they have zero contact. She was the on-again-off-again girlfriend of Justin Bieber before they ultimately split in 2018. He married Hailey shortly after. All three parties appear to have long ago moved on, but any hint of interaction or comment is picked apart by their followers as evidence of an ongoing feud.\nAbout six months ago, Gomez's fans targeted Hailey after she posted a TikTok made with Jenner and Justine Skye, in which they're lip-syncing to the words, “I’m not saying she deserves it, but God’s timing is always right.”\nThe TikTok was posted around the same time Gomez was receiving unflattering attention over some paparazzi photos. Hailey has denied the post was related at all, and deleted the TikTok.\n“I never comment on this type of thing but we were just having a girls' night and did a random TikTok sound for fun,” she wrote later. “It’s not directed at anyone.”\nHailey eventually asked Gomez to speak with her fans about the ongoing harassment she was receiving. \n“This isn't what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop,” Gomez said on social media.\nHailey responded with gratitude, saying, “I want to thank Selena for speaking out, as her and I have been discussing the last few weeks how to move past this ongoing narrative between her and I.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-01 20:06:00", "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have had a very passionate and public relationship and were engaged after less than a year of dating in October 2021. They shared photos from the beach proposal in Montecito, California.\nThey ended up having quite a few weddings ceremonies, one in las Vegas, one in a Santa Barbara clerk's office to make things legal, and one in Italy. This might all seem fast, but they have actually been friends and neighbors for quite some time. They both have homes in Calabasas but have been in other relationships.\nKardashian has three children with her ex, Scott Disick: Mason, Penelope, and Reign. Barker has two children: Landon and Alabama, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, and is the step-dad to Moakler's daughter, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya. \nIn June, Kardashian and Barker announced they were expecting their first child together. \nHere's Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's complete relationship timeline.\nThe couple was seen together in Palm Springs at Kris Jenner's home there, sparking rumors they might be dating. People reported in late January that it was official, with a source saying, “They're in Palm Springs together. They've been dating for about a month or two.” The source added, “Travis has liked her for a while.” \nE! reported they went to dinner at Matsuhisa in Los Angeles, and an eyewitness told the publication that “they seem very connected, very close. Travis took her hand, and they giggled as they started having a little thumb war with one another. It was playful and sweet. They were talking constantly and very engaged with one another. It seems like such a natural fit.”\nThey spent that Valentine's Day together, according to Page Six. Barker went semi-Instagram official by sharing a photo of a diamond anklet that he gave her on his Instagram Story. Kardashian shared an ode to her new boyfriend on her Instagram Story: “Roses are red / Violets are blue / Garlic bread / Blink-182,” the poem read.\nShe later went official-official with a picture of her hand and Barker's entwined. Barker commented “🖤” on the post. A source told People at the time,“Kourtney is very happy with Travis. She wanted to confirm their relationship, because it's something positive.”\nIn early March, Barker made an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show. Barrymore asked Barker about dating with kids, and he took the opportunity to praise Kardashian.\n“Up until now, I would date girls who didn't have kids, and I find it kind of hard because I think they would have trouble understanding, like, ‘Why don't you want to go to dinner every night with me? Or why don't you want to see me every night?’,” Barker said. “And now, I'm spending time with a woman who's a great mom, who's a great friend, and you don't have to worry about any of those things. It just comes natural.” \nLater in March, they were photographed at UFC 260: Miocic vs. Ngannou 2 fight, alongside friends Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly. \nMGK, Megan Fox, Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian in the house for #UFC260 🙌(@espnmma) pic.twitter.com/8kdRcCmnnP\nThey took their first family vacation in April, heading to Deer Valley, Utah. Kardashian shared pics featuring Alabama and Atiana on snowmobiles.\nKardashian called Barker her boyfriend for the first time in a TikTok posted by Barker's daughter, Alabama, while playing the viral “Pass the Phone” challenge. \n“I'm passing the phone to my boyfriend,” she said.\nBarker also shared content from the vacation, including some videos from the slopes.\nThey spent that Easter together as well, and Kris Jenner shared pics of the family gathering on Instagram.\n“Happy Easter, and thank you @callawaygolf #irvingazoff for making our Easter so special!!! 🙏🐰🐣🐥🙏 and thank you for the @coreygamble @realtristan13 @travisscott @travisbarker that are already on the golf course!!!!!!! LOL #impatient,” Jenner captioned the post.\nThat month, a source told Entertainment Tonight that things had become “way more serious.” \n“This is the happiest Kourtney has been in a while, and her family is thrilled for her,” the source said. “Kourtney and Travis' kids get along great, and all have the best time together. Kourtney's been trying to keep their relationship as private as she can on social media, but they're both super into each other and cute together.”\nThen Barker got a tattoo reading “Kourtney” on his chest. \nFor the reality TV star's 42nd birthday, Barker gave her a huge bouquet.\nAnd on Instagram, he wrote, “I F-CKING LOVE YOU! 🖤 YOU'RE A BLESSING TO THIS WORLD HAPPY BIRTHDAY.”\nThey headed back to Utah later that month.\nFor Mother's Day, Barker gave Kardashian more flowers.\nAnd he got another tattoo of the words “I love you,” in her handwriting.\nKardashian helped Barker take his first flight since 2008 after surviving a crash 13 years prior. He captioned his post about the flight to Mexico, “With you anything is possible.”\nThey headed to Italy to celebrate.\nShortly after, Kardashian's ex Scott Disick sent an Instagram DM to one of The Kardashian star's ex-boyfriends, Younes Bendjima, saying, “Yo is this chick ok!???? Broooo like what is this. In the middle of Italy.” \nDisick appeared to be jealous of her affection with with her new beau.\nThe couple went red carpet official at the 2021 MTV VMAs.\nOn October 17, 2021, Barker proposed to Kardashian on the beach in Montecito, California.\nKardashian and Barker spent the holidays with their family, and she shared some pics with the caption, “‘Twas the night before Christmas.”\nThe couple enjoyed a “practice” wedding in Las Vegas after the Grammys, and she shared photos of her and Barker at a chapel, explaining they were not actually married.\n“Found these in my camera roll,” Kardashian wrote. “Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license). Practice makes perfect.”\nTalk of having kids is on the table. A source speaking to Entertainment Tonight said that the couple is “so in love,” and they are “open to the idea of having children together and growing their family.” \nIt was added that “their families are both supportive of it too and just want them to be happy.” \nThey had another wedding ceremony in May, but this one was legally binding. TMZ broke the news that they were married on Sunday, May 15, in Santa Barbara. They left the scene of the courthouse in a convertible with a “Just Married” sign attached to its trunk.\nPeople confirmed the news, with a source saying, “They had to legally get married first ahead of their big Italian wedding, which is happening very soon. All the details are set and the whole family, including all the kids, are very excited.”\nThe big ceremony took place in Portofino, Italy, and the event eventually became a special aired on Hulu. \nIn June, Barker had a scary and painful health complication and had to be hospitalized for pancreatitis. TMZ wrote he was checked into West Hills hospital, then transferred by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\nLater, Barker wrote on Instagram Stories, “I went in for an endoscopy Monday feeling great. But After dinner, I developed excruciating pain and have been hospitalized ever since.” \nHe continued, “During the endoscopy, I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube. This resulted in severe life threatening pancreatitis.”\nBarker concluded, “I am so very very grateful that with intensive treatment I am currently much better.”\nOn Stories, Kardashian wrote, “Oh what a scary and emotional week it has been. Our health is everything and sometimes we take for granted how quickly it can change. Travis and I went in for a routine endoscopy together and he ended up with severe, life-threatening pancreatitis.”\nShe added, “I am so grateful to God for healing my husband, for all of your prayers for him and for us, for the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. I am so touched and appreciative.”\nShe then thanked doctors and nurses at Cedars Sinai for their “wonderful care” of them both, writing, “It's crazy how sometimes words could never truly express the gratitude or feelings I have inside me.” \nKardashian joined Travis Barker as he went on tour with Machine Gun Kelly, and shared some pictures of what it looks like being a “tour wife.”\nBarker commented on the post, “Tour life's better with you,” with a black heart and devil face emoji for a little emphasis. He later shared some pics of her too.\n“Practice makes perfect,” he captioned it.\nWhich she re-shared, writing, “Time for drum practice.”\n“Favorite time of the day,” Barker commented.\nIn September, Kardashian told WSJ magazine that she and Barker had decided to pause their fertility treatments when they were planning their wedding. \n“We started an IVF journey, but I stopped. It was a lot,” she said. “I took a break to just focus on our wedding and getting married.” \nKardashian attended Barker's Coachella set with Blink-182 and original bandmate Tom DeLonge.\n“My first @blink182 show!” Kardashian wrote on a post about the night.\nBarker then commented, “Your coming on tour with me.”\nIn May, Kardashian shared on the first episode of The Kardashians' third season more about ending IVF. \n“We are officially done with IVF,” she said in a confessional. “We would love a baby more than anything, but I just really believe in what God has in store for us. If that’s a baby, then I believe that it will happen.”\nShe said added that her seven frozen eggs from before she started dating Barker “didn’t survive, [and none of them] made it to an embryo.”\n“The freezing of the eggs isn’t guaranteed,” she said. “I think that that’s a misunderstanding. People do it thinking that it’s like a safety net and it’s not.” \nShe added, “Whatever’s meant to be... Being happy is most important, and being a good parent to my kids.”\nIn June, Kardashian and Barker announced they were expecting a baby by having the POOSH founder hold  up a sign reading, “Travis, I'm pregnant” at a Blink-182 concert. \nJust one week later, they shared the baby’s sex with a shot of blue confetti: They are having a boy.\nA source told Entertainment Tonight in June, “Kourtney and Travis are on cloud nine. This pregnancy is beyond Kourtney's wildest dreams. Kourtney and Travis feel like this is one of the most magical things to happen to them and a complete miracle. They are so thrilled and can't wait to experience this pregnancy together, bring a baby into the world as a unit, and expand and grow their families.\" \nKardashian shared some very sexy maternity looks with the caption “lost and found.” \nIn September, Barker returned from his Blink-182 tour to join Kardashian at a hospital in Los Angeles, California. The couple were photographed leaving together, but there has been no announcement as to what the issue was. However, the band tweeted about changing tour plans in light of Barker's exodus.\nDue to an urgent family matter, Travis has had to return home to the States.

At the top of it are Eras Tour star Taylor Swift and her new romantic interest, NFL star Travis Kelce. In a conversation with the Daily Mail, Klum essentially offered an open invitation to the pair. \n“I would love to invite them,” she said at the American's Got Talent show finale, which Klum judges.\nShe added, “If they would just show up, I'm sure no one at the door will turn them away. Unless the costume is so strong that no one recognizes them, like mine.”\nKlum could have been referring to a number of elaborate costumes she's donned over her many years as a Halloween hostess, but she most likely meant her “earthworm” costume from 2022. She was definitely unrecognizable.\nThe costume went immediately viral and Klum was applauded for her sense of humor, but she said her team told her it was a “crazy” idea and tried to discourage it. Thankfully, she could not be stopped.\nSwift and Kelce were seen together last weekend following the Kansas City Chiefs game at an after party, where photographers snapped a shot of her with an arm around his neck. She was also photographed in the VIP box with Kelce's mother, Donna.\nIt has been rumored that the pair have just started spending time together, but a source said they have already been joking about a couple's costume. Specifically, they want to go as Barbie and Ken from the Margot Robbie-led hit. \n“The whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is OK with,” the insider said. “He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”\nThey add, “Heidi Klum's Halloween party is a very big option for them to attend, they haven't made it 100 per cent, but since they have made things official in other ways that they have even started a relationship, they are really feeling it all out and they might want to make that night be the night they go, red carpet official.”\nThe new couple is entirely aware of how much scrutiny they're already receiving.\n“This is the relationship they put themselves into, and they are prepared to see it through and see where it goes and are looking to take advantage of everything it brings on the outside along with the personal enjoyment that comes from it,” the source explained. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

So you’ll be happy to hear that relationships are due to come into clearer focus this Wednesday, October 4 as flirty Mercury swings into Libra and your partnership house until October 22. Hopefully you got your ducks in a row during the messenger planet’s extra-long tour of Virgo and your organized, health-conscious sixth house that began on July 28. Thanks to a retrograde from August 23 to September 15, you may have been able to get your systems and fitness regimen back on track. Now, Ram, you’re ready to share the good parts of your life with a special someone. Expressive Mercury in diplomatic Libra will supply the perfect words to express your hopes for how you’d like things to be. Been on the fence about a situationship—or been waiting for your partner to go all in on a plan? This quick transit can turn a maybe into a yes—or no way! Well, at least you’ll know.\nOn Sunday, a second planet ends its extended voyage through a sign—and this one will also bring some developments for your love life. Romantic Venus bids passionate, dramatic (and yeah, exhausting) Leo farewell after a protracted passage that began way back on June 5. If you made it through the July 22 to September 3 Venus retrograde with your relationships intact, good on you! But even the healthiest, happiest partnerships were not immune to the theatrics that this four-month cycle kicked up.\nNormally, you wouldn’t be quite so excited to hear that Venus is settling into predictable Virgo for a month, but that news is right on time this Sunday, October 8. Single Rams should make qualities like “lives a healthy lifestyle” and “is grounded and well groomed” top-tier criteria. As within, so without, right? Your odds of being treated well go up exponentially when you pick partners who take great care of themselves. Coupled Rams might hop on the wellness wagon together. When you’re cooking a romantic dinner, make it Paleo or vegan and go for evening jogs in tandem before hunkering down to re-watch an older season of Game of Thrones.\nThis Venus cycle inspires you to get back on the wagon and treat your body like the temple it is. Your sign loves a challenge, but pleasure-seeking Venus is anti-pain. Find a workout that feels fun, maybe one with a competitive element, like cycling or a vigorous dance class. Since you bore easily, look for teachers who change their playlists and sequences often. Since Venus is the planet of romance, you might apply a similar philosophy to the game of love.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

And after two buzzy months activating your social third house, Mercury comes in for a landing in Libra this Wednesday, October 4. As the communicative planet hunkers down in your intimate, domestic fourth house until October 22, make time for the real VIPs in your life—your oldest and dearest friends and people who share your DNA. (The ones you like, that is.) You might take a pass on some fun parties or industry events in lieu of movie nights and home-cooked meals for your BFFs.\nIs your pad hosting ready? If not, use this Mercury cycle to make your living space more comfortable and functional. Reorganize your storage area, create a stunning fall tablescape, and maybe invest in a new crockpot for easy cool-weather meals. Social Mercury might even inspire you to join a cooking, wine or book club to connect in a homespun way with people who share your interests.\nBut don’t go into total hiding, Cancer! On Sunday, October 8, vivacious Venus picks up where Mercury left off. As the glamorous romance planet struts into Virgo until November 8, your concept of “home” may extend to your entire hometown. Whenever cabin fever sets in, flap your social butterfly wings and go explore new venues in your neighborhood. Lively conversations will keep you engaged—careful you don’t miss your Lyft chatting away with that engaging raconteur outside the bar. If you’re not feeling the cultural scene in your area, adopt yourself into a more happening zip code. Switch your fitness membership to a studio there or, if you’re an independent contractor, rent a desk in a co-working space. That way, you’ll have a landing place after your commute.\nLove goddess Venus can make you quite the coquette when she sails through your third house. And TBH, you’re ready to lighten things up! Since June 5, Venus has been hiding out in Leo’s den, spinning her wheels in your traditional second house. The retrograde phase from July 22 to September 3 may have made those once-anchoring routines feel downright stultifying. Or maybe you found yourself bored by the non-options before you. Take heart! Starting Sunday, you can freely sample Cupid’s smorgasbord and be more forward when you flirt. Even if you claim you’re not the Tinder type, you might be pleased by what and who the dating apps yield over the coming four weeks. Coupled Crabs should socialize more often as a pair. Play event co-coordinators for your shared friend group—it’s a great way to bond now.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

A loud alarm rings this Wednesday, October 4 as your cosmic champion, Mercury, peels out of your domestic zone and races into Libra and your fifth house of self-expression and romance. For the past two months (since July 28), Mercury’s extended saunter through Virgo kept your focus on home and personal issues. Matters under your roof or with family may have been especially bumpy during the August 23 to September 15 retrograde. If you hit a roadblock at work or on a passion project, you’ll be happy to hear that Mercury’s move through Libra can help you overcome it between now and October 22. Residual tension with roommates and relatives should dissipate. If you’ve been keeping a low profile anywhere, the quicksilver planet in your flamboyant fifth house of fame may turn the spotlight directly on you. Pitch, perform, present—and strike a pose!\nSince the fifth house rules romance, cheeky Mercury’s tour through Libra could make you even MORE of a shameless flirt. Talking to strangers is a Gemini specialty. So is leading them on. With fair-minded Libra in the mix, it’s best to be up front about your intentions—or at least your limitations, like say, the fact that you just started seriously dating someone or you’re moving across country in three weeks. If there are obvious lines you don’t intend to cross, honor them. We’re certain you’ll still find ways to get your kicks!\nWhile Mercury makes you the toast of the town, don’t roll up the welcome mat altogether. Romance takes a turn for the cozier this Sunday, October 8 when comfort-loving Venus moves into Virgo and picks up where Mercury left off. As the planet of amour nestles into your sentimental and domestic fourth house until November 8, you’ll be seeking a spoonmate. Expert cuddling skills should be a pre-requisite for anyone wishing to climb into your bed. If you’re not the type who can sleep wrapped up in someone’s arms, consciously create moments for TLC. Maybe a hand-in-hand evening stroll or some downtempo snuggle time before hitting the sack? (Best done with all digital devices out of reach.) If you don’t already live with your love interest, cohabitation may become a hot topic over the coming four weeks.\nAnd roll out the welcome mat for the decorating muse! Venus in DIY Virgo could turn your “maison” into a maker’s space—or at least the canvas for your creativity. If you’re the crafty type, enjoy four fun weeks of making anything and everything by hand. Macrame planters or have a canning party to preserve delicious summer fruits. You could go total Prairie Home Companion on the world, no apologies! If you’re more of an enthusiast than an artisan, join a wine or book club or host a dinner party before November 8. \nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

This Wednesday, October 4, astute Mercury logs into Libra and your wellness sector until October 22, fueling your desire to “green up” your life. Odds are, you’re more than ready to get life back into an orderly groove. Mercury’s been on a hedonistic tear through your fifth house of passion and pleasure since July 28. And the August 23 to September 15 retrograde certainly didn’t help with willpower one iota.\nYou don’t have to go cold turkey on anything or make any radical moves. A better approach is to check out a few new activities and see if they’re something you can commit to. While you don’t mind going hard on a workout, the “no pain, no gain” shtick is SO not you, Bull. Don’t forget to add adequate sleep, hydration and reducing stress to your list. Over the next three weeks, book those doctors’ appointments, schedule a massage or two and, as we head into colder weather, focus on preventative medicine, the smartest kind of all.\nOn Sunday, October 8, a second planet wraps up a prolonged passage—and this time, it’s your ruler Venus who we’re talking about. The queen of beauty and romance has been parked in Leo and your caretaking, family-oriented fourth house since way back on June 5. Lately, Taurus, it seems like everyone is relying on you for SOME basic need. And while Venus was retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had some unexpected domestic matters to attend to. Emotions have certainly run high. Hopefully you had supportive people on hand to help you process them.\nWe bet you’ll be happy to hear that Venus is moving into a much happier place for Bulls this Sunday, October 8. Until November 8, she’ll be cruising through Virgo and your fifth house of fame, flirtation and fashion-forward flamboyance. Step out of those low-lying areas and let yourself be seen! (And maybe in one of the “haute” pieces in your wardrobe!) Feel free to make a stop at the salon because the whole world feels like your runway for the next four weeks. Your social life—and your love life—are sure to see an uptick with Venus here. Get your name on a couple invite lists and you’ll quickly reclaim your rightful place among the cultural cognoscenti.\nSingle Bulls might have some fresh arm candy to show off before November 8. If you’re attached, Venus could get you ridiculously inspired to co-create, and that may span the range from redecorating your bedroom to getting sized for rings. The fifth house rules fertility, and “getting in the family way” could suddenly seem like a romantic idea.

After two months revving its engines in Virgo (including that schedule-skewing retrograde from August 23 to September 15), the messenger planet heads into Libra and your pragmatic, productive second house until October 22. If you need to play catch-up on administrative affairs like paying bills and sorting your work schedule, you’re in luck. Mercury in balanced Libra can help you slow down enough to evaluate the deluge of downloads that have flooded in since July 28.\nNo, this might not be the most fun you’ve had in ages, but as a Virgo, you’re happiest when your affairs are in order. During this three-week transit, you’ll be able to screen out distractions and focus on your high-priority items. Getting your budget squared away is a good place to start, even if that entails cutting back on a bit of socializing. But it’s not all about what you have to go without. Inventive Mercury in your money sector can trigger creative revenue-generating ideas and lead you to collaborators and clients who might play a role in them.\nAnd if you’re worried about being all work, no play, let us allay your fears. This Sunday, October 8 enchanting Venus makes her annual stopover to Virgo and ignites your radiant pilot light until November 8. This shift will be palpable since Venus has been on an extended tour through Leo and your dreamy, fantasy-fueled twelfth house since way back on June 5. There was also a retrograde to contend with between July 22 and September 3, which may have churned up some old fears. If you’ve been flying under the radar, this is your invitation to come back out and play.\nWhen the planet of beauty and love visits your realm, you can’t hide your glow!

You need to save that energy for your fellow luminaries! For romance or finance, you could attract some high-visibility players by November 8—and even step into that role yourself.\nCoupled Virgos should lovingly explain that you’re going to need a little more solo time. For best results, reassure your partner that you’re not blowing them off and share openly about your adventures when you return to base.

(And the retrograde from August 23 to September 3 was not exactly kind to your finances. Grrr.) Relish your role of superconnector again starting Wednesday when effusive Mercury heads into social Libra and your expressive third house until October 22.

The third house rules hometown happenings, and your local scene will be hopping. Flit like the social butterfly you are, but don’t feel pressured to settle down in any one garden. With capricious Mercury here, you’ll prefer dabbling to signing on for lifetime membership. And in your communication house, the messenger planet gives you the gift of gab AND the power of persuasion.

On Sunday, October 8, you’ll wave love planet Venus farewell after her protracted, four-month journey through your sign.

As Venus heads into Virgo and your luxuriating second house until November 8, woe betide anyone who tries rushing you. Wake up a little earlier so you can take your sweet ol’ time to get ready—whether you’re assembling a runway-perfect outfit or journaling as you sip your post-meditation tea.\nThese next four weeks can be plenty sensual. Reduce your speed and savor the simple (but decadent) pleasures: sex on high-thread-count sheets, sharing a great bottle of vino, cuddling up for a marathon of a show that you both love. Of course, slowing down enough to actually talk to each other at the end of the day can be the most potent aphrodisiac of all. Single Leos might be drawn to the more traditional type.

On a “lite” day, you’re a deep thinker, Scorpio (sometimes you’re even a mystery unto yourself). That’s part of your intense appeal—to the people who aren’t content with anything superficial. Between now and October 22, your creative life will be rich. Record every fantastical notion, even if you have zero idea about the practical application just yet.\nWhile Mercury took a long trek through Virgo since July 28—including a befuddling retrograde from August 23 to September 15—your team-spirited eleventh house was in its crosshairs. Have you had your fill of people-time yet? Retreat into solitude (at least a few nights a week) and enjoy the contemplative, restful energy of Mercury in the twelfth house. Once the buzzy planet wings into your sign on October 22, you won’t have many quiet moments. Enjoy a little serenity while you can!\nNot that you can go total “lone wolf,” of course. On Sunday, another planet wraps up a prolonged cycle. This time, it’s convivial Venus who struts into Virgo and your collaborative, experimental eleventh house until November 8. This will be a refreshing change of pace! Since June 5, Venus was parked in Leo, pouring her enchanting energy into your tenth house of career. Despite the rocky retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had some exciting professional developments over the past four months.\nBefore burnout sets in, add more “play” to your work-life balance equation. And if you’re single and searching, take a hard left away from the conventional, Scorpio. With Venus in your delightfully eccentric eleventh house, anyone too “vanilla” will have to wait. Make a policy of NOT judging a book by its cover for the next few weeks. Venus is the image consultant of the skies so make sure you’re wearing enough of your own personality on your sleeve. Push the envelope with your style—even if you have to wait until after office hours to fully unleash.\nThe eleventh house is the tech sector, and with love goddess Venus logging in, single Scorpios have higher odds of success on dating apps. Group hangs could also yield some hot prospects—and with the bonus of friends who can verify their references, which is a huge plus for your gun-shy sign. Coupled Scorpios should make a point of mingling outside the house together more often. Where do your respective friend groups overlap? Here’s your opportunity to form a joint entourage of people you BOTH enjoy—and fill the fall calendar with dinner parties, dive bar nights and weekend trips en masse.    \nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Libra Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:07", "text": "(September 23 - October 22)\nIf your birthday season has been off to a slow start, you might want to buckle up this Wednesday, October 4. After two months slogging through Virgo and your transitional twelfth house, social Mercury commences its annual visit to your sign until October 22, energizing you mentally and physically and sparking your creative juices. Genius ideas and opportunities for collaborations come flowing in like magic, but you won’t have time for small talk. You’re a Libra on a mission, so set your sights for the finish line and hit the gas.\nAre you ready to refresh your personal brand? With the messenger planet whirring in your first house of identity, experiment with new ways of dressing and expressing yourself. This is a particularly rich time to use your language and communication skills, since Mercury rules thought and speech. Don’t worry about “the party line” and spare yourself the corporate jargon. Speak from the heart and you’ll have ’em before you even form the word “hello.”\nOn Sunday, it’s your cosmic custodian Venus who is ending the second prolonged transit of this week. After four whole months in Leo and your cerebral, experimental eleventh house, the love planet glides into Virgo until November 8. With your twelfth house of fantasy lit by Venus for four weeks, you won’t be stuck in your head the way you’ve been since June 5. (And let’s not even talk about Venus’ libido-numbing retrograde from July 22 to September 3.) In fact, a torrent of bottled-up emotions may come rushing out—everything from deep desire to grief. Welcome this release, Libra. Uncomfortable as it may be, it’s also cleansing and gets you back into feeling like the heart-centered, caring soul you relish being in the world.\nRose-colored glasses may be a favorite accessory for some Libras during this phase. Until November 8, your imagination will run towards the dreamier end of the spectrum. This will be a huge blessing for your creative pursuits and your ability to glimpse the highest potential in any situation. But easy does it when it comes to love. True, there are few things quite so magical as “new relationship energy.” But in time the dew will evaporate and you’ll have to deal with the very real human standing in front of you. Go ahead and enjoy the luscious liftoff you get from falling into a lover’s arms. (No one could stop you, anyway.) But wait until you’ve been through a good day and a bad one together before making it Instagram official. People’s “flaws” might shatter a few romantic illusions. But those edges can actually create some undeniably sexy dynamic tension.\nCoupled Libras may feel adrift during this Venus cycle, perhaps due to an unresolved issue you swept under the rug. Instead of ruminating or stewing in resentment, bravely begin a dialogue about the distance you’re feeling. If you’re not able to broach the matter without sounding accusatory or confused, consider that your cue to do some private processing first. The underlying issue may have little to do with bae—and more to do with something you locked in the vault of your childhood memories. See what you can unearth before Venus comes home to Libra on November 8.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a. The AstroTwins) are ELLE.com’s resident astrologers.

{"title": "Capricorn Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:08", "text": "(December 22 - January 19)\nThe pumpkin lagers are flowing freely, but starting this Wednesday, October 4, you’ll be on your grind—and perhaps too busy to partake in happy hours. As astute Mercury stampedes into Libra and your tenth house of professional ambition and success until October 22, your competitive spirit is lit! Visualize yourself mingling with the heavy hitters and then, find your “in” to their elite circles.\nClimbing the career ladder involves more than busting your butt on the job. With social Libra ruling your tenth house, you know that it’s also about who you know—and how strong your relationships are. If the aforementioned happy hour serves a bonus opportunity to network, by all means pop up with your elevator pitch rehearsed. Since the tenth house is the domain of the divine masculine, men may appear as “earth angels” over the coming few weeks. Reach out to some of the helpful and influential guys in your sphere if you need a boost.\nRomantically, you’ll be in wilder and far more playful spirits starting this Sunday, October 8. After four months submerged in Leo and your private eighth house, Venus comes up for air, heading into Virgo and your zone of adventures and optimism. You’ve held a lot in since June 5—and may have felt locked tighter than an international bank vault while Venus spun retrograde from July 22 to September 3. But starting Sunday, your icy defenses quickly begin to thaw.\nUntil November 8 (and hopefully after that, too) you’ll enjoy pushing the erotic envelope and expanding your palette. The ninth house rules travel and cross-cultural connections, making it the perfect opportunity to diversify your dating portfolio. You could swoon for someone whose packaging is VERY different from your own. If you’re single and heading out of town over the next four weeks, pack some alluring eveningwear. You might wind up going on impromptu dates when you’re done with your day of meetings.\nCoupled Capricorns, don’t go into early hibernation mode just yet. This Venus cycle wants you out, exploring the world as a pair. If you’re in a relationship, research destinations together, ideally someplace neither of you has been. Even a night in a boutique hotel will do wonders for your mood AND your love life.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Sagittarius Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:08", "text": "(November 22 - December 21)\nYou’ll have other things on your mind besides “work, work and more work” starting Wednesday, October 4. That day, messenger Mercury saunters into Libra and your eleventh house of teamwork and technology until October 22. This marks the end of Mercury’s hyperactive trek through Virgo and your career zone that began on July 28—an extra-long journey because of a retrograde from August 23 to September 15. Some Archers may have burned the candle at both ends to cover for vacationing colleagues. Now it’s time to let others come to YOUR aid. With the communication planet buzzing through your community-spirited eleventh house, you can blend work with socializing or get chummier with a few cool coworkers.\nPro tip: When recruiting members for the Sagittarius Dream Team, be slow and selective. For ANY joint ventures to succeed, you need to sync up with the right, qualified people. Mercury can make you quick with the trigger finger but take the time to follow through on background checks and references. And before you set off for world domination together, test the waters with a small-scale project to make sure you click.\nBut don’t put the power suit in mothballs just yet. On Sunday, October 8, charming, convivial Venus picks up where Mercury left off, heading into Virgo and your achievement zone until November 8. This shift is a seismic one since it marks the end of Venus’ prolonged passage through Leo and your adventurous, independent ninth house that began way back on June 5. You’ve preferred to be a free-range Sagittarius for the past four months—or at least a Centaur on a longer leash. And while Venus was retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had to face some uncomfortable truths. But the answer to the question “What’s next?” may have eluded you.\nWith Venus heading into Virgo on Sunday, you’ll be ready to get your hands back on the wheel. For the coming four weeks, DON’T just go with the flow, romantically speaking. That’s how you wind up in a whisky-tango-foxtrot kind of dance with…wait, what’s your name, actually? No, you can’t control EVERY aspect of interpersonal relationships, but you can certainly elevate your standards. Keep them high…and also realistic. If you know that your crush is moving abroad in three months, why even set yourself up for torment?\nAlready spoken for? This is power couple time. Dress up and circulate as a pair—working the room together can be such a turn on! Or beef up the shared savings account by making new investment plans or even launching a business together. What starts as a kitchen-table side hustle (a special offering for the holiday season, perhaps?) could draw a legit income stream over time.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Aquarius Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:09", "text": "(January 20 - February 18)\nFree your mind! That’s not something we have to say to an Aquarius often. But ever since mental Mercury plunged into Virgo and your intense eighth house on July 28, you’ve been especially prone to ruminating. (And let’s not even talk about the stuck energy of the August 23 to September 15 retrograde…) But this Wednesday, October 4, Mercury moves on to lighthearted Libra, pulling you out of that rut and restoring your optimism.\nWhile problems won’t evaporate into thin air, your perspective is likely to shift. From now until October 22, you’ll be driven by your sense of humor and adventurous spirit. This is a great time to reconnect with friends in other states or countries. Keep your WhatsApp alerts on because you never know who may ping you out of the blue. Your mind will be hungry for fresh inspiration and information, so sign up for a foreign language class or apply to a certification program that can bump you into a higher pay grade.\nJust as Mercury leaves your eighth house, Venus—the other planet who’s pulling out of a protracted passage—plunges in. On Sunday, October 8, the goddess of love wraps up a four-month tour through Leo and your seventh house of partnerships. That might sound like a heavenly bonus, but since Venus spun retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had your hands full with relationship issues. Your own desire for commitment may have run hot and cold and an ex’s disruptions didn’t make things any easier.\nWith Venus now heading into Virgo from Sunday until November 8, you have a chance to hit the brakes and see who can REALLY go the distance. (And who you actually want to have by your side for that marathon.) It’s not superficial to care about appearances, Aquarius—you like what you like. But looks might take third place to intellect and higher purpose between now and November 8. (Aim for the trifecta of all three and you’ll strike the bull’s eye.) If you’re single and searching, circulate among the high-vibes crowd. Virgo is the sign of service and with this cosmic energy ruling your erotic eighth house it’s no wonder you get all hot for the humanitarian type. No, a meditation circle or activist meetup shouldn’t be treated like a pick-up joint, but there’s no reason you can’t be open to the fringe benefit of meeting someone multi-dimensionally attractive there.\nAre you already half of a purpose-driven power couple? With Venus casting her rosy glow over your relationship until November 8, your resistance to permanent bonding could melt away. Open that joint checking account, start house hunting, get engaged. Already did one or all three of those? Scoop a little out of your shared funds and splurge on a sexier bedroom set or maybe a couples retreat somewhere steamy and tropical. \nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Pisces Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:10", "text": "(February 19 - March 20)\nWhat’s REALLY going on here, Pisces? Wednesday, October 4 kicks off an exploratory few weeks as curious Mercury deep dives into Libra and your eighth house of secrets, mysteries and intimacy until October 22. It’s not like you take things at face value, but during this sleuthing span, you won’t be happy until you get to the bottom of the mystery. You might pursue some kind of metaphysical or esoteric study, like Tarot cards or astrology. Keep your intuition humming along by paying extra-close attention to people’s vibes and body language and the synchronicities that others write off as coincidence. (Your tuned-in sign knows better!)\nWith the messenger planet parked in this seductive zone, your magnetism will be dialed up. If you’re single, take your sweet time getting to know someone before merging on a soul level (or whatever you want to call that). Attached? Plan more “just the two of us” time. Bonus points if you do that in a romantic setting, preferably after the sun’s gone down.\nAnother call to the couple bubble comes on Sunday, October 8, as sensual Venus vectors into Virgo and your relationship zone until November 8. This shift is a welcome one since Venus has been paddling through your austere sixth house (Leo) since June 5—an extra-long time due to the July 22 to September 3 retrograde. Since then, you may have felt a bit guarded or more focused on getting grounded and healthy than doing other sorts of things with your body.\nThe odds of finding your “someone” increase exponentially as Venus swings by your seventh house from Sunday until November 8. Yes, even if you are still nursing wounded feelings from a breakup or decided two days ago to take a dating sabbatical to focus on your painting. Cupid’s timing is rarely convenient—and it doesn’t have to be either/or. Who says new love can’t heal you or that your potential S.O. can’t compose songs in the background while you’re layering Cadmium Red onto a canvas? Having boundaries is one thing but making rules to keep yourself “safe” could mean missing out on someone special.\nAlready found your true love? Don’t shy away from talks of exclusivity or areas that could use some improvement. Harmonious Venus lends a hand in the “creative compromise” department. If you both give an inch or put more energy towards a shared goal, your combined efforts might make magic. Old-married types should lighten up about those petty things that make you crazy, like socks on the bedroom floor or dishes in the sink. Instead, focus on the things you love about your mate, and see if that doesn’t make hearts (and other regions) swell.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Ella Richards and Lucie de la Falaise Are Fashion (And Rock) Royalty", "date": "2023-10-02 12:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe multigenerational style icons on family, style, and staying power. \nOn the outskirts of Paris, a studio blooms with bright flowers—some real, some faux. Lucie de la Falaise, however, is accoutred in all black. “I’m like a strong fairy,” the legendary model jokes. Her daughter Ella Richards, the shoot’s other subject—in a white bathrobe and house slippers, and the same slick blonde chignon as Mom—counters: “If you are, then I am.”\nThat exchange sums up their playful dynamic, the two perpetually in cahoots. When the photographer behind the shoot, Brigitte Niedermair, saw the duo leaving Dior’s Mumbai show in March sniffing jasmine necklaces, very much in fairy mode, she had the idea to photograph them festooned with blooms, and clad in some of fall’s most exuberant, lush takes on floral, from designers like Bottega Veneta and Chanel.\nTheir lighthearted demeanor belies a weighty legacy in both fashion and rock ’n’ roll. De la Falaise’s aunt Loulou was a muse to Yves Saint Laurent, and de la Falaise herself worked for the designer, when, at 21, she decided to marry Marlon Richards, the son of Keith Richards. (They’re still together.) Thus Anita Pallenberg, the late rock goddess and reluctant model who played the villainess in Barbarella, is, in addition to being the subject of the recent documentary Anita, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, Ella Richards’s grandmother.\nAll of which is to say: Mother and daughter have It Girl-dom practically encoded in their DNA, though de la Falaise and her longtime publicist and later business partner Hélène Renaud remind me—warmly, humbly—that I really needn’t go there again. Yes, those rock-royalty genes are a “huge benefit,” and the physical resemblances are obvious. But I could take a different tack when writing about them, like when Cat Power covered “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” and entirely left out the titular chorus (to very satisfying effect, it must be said). Old song, new life.\nAs for de la Falaise—who is based in West Sussex, where the family decamped some two decades ago—she’s relieved to be on the other side of the “old-fashioned idea” that any of us is just one thing. Today, “you can be pretty and have a voice, too,” she says, “and have something on the side.” You can bloom again and again.\nIn 2017, she and Renaud launched Lucie de la Falaise Studio, a lifestyle/interior design firm, to spearhead more of the kinds of collaborations they’ve done in the past. In 2016, de la Falaise designed a wicker picnic hamper kitted out with Dior plates, glasses, cutlery, and napkins. And in 2018, for Schiaparelli’s spring haute couture collection, she dreamed up a series of bags made from raffia, wicker, driftwood, wooden beads, pearls, and upcycled plastic. De la Falaise and Richards demur when asked about upcoming projects—“That stuff’s always hush-hush until the last minute,” Richards says—but it’s something to see them together in the meantime.\nNow 50, de la Falaise was in her early twenties and in the midst of her modeling career when she had her daughter, who then was often on set for (and ended up in) her mom’s shoots. When Richards later accepted her own modeling gigs, for brands like Burberry and Tom Ford, de la Falaise chaperoned her as vigilantly as she’d been chaperoned herself. Richards says her mom encouraged her to “figure out what you love...try a little bit of everything.” (Also, her godmother Kate Moss—whose agency Richards has signed with—has impressed upon her that “No” is a full sentence.) \nBased in London, the 27-year-old Richards is a city girl but not a wild child. Clubbing, she says, has “never really been my thing.” Dinners with friends are so much better. Her closet, bookshelf, and apartment in general are stuffed with heirlooms and hand-me-downs—including Pallenberg’s clothes (an archive she wants to publicly exhibit) as well as her books. She’s planning to read a couple of the classics next: Dune, by Frank Herbert, and The Leopard, by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa—novels, incidentally, about succession and finding your place in the world order.\nHer favorite possessions tend to be secondhand—including a pale pink silk frock that belonged to the model-actress Patti Hansen, her step-grandmother. “I couldn’t wait for the day that I would grow into it,” she says. She loves to look for garments at vintage shops and to browse antiques at online auctions before bedtime. “That’s what excites me these days!” she admits.\nRichards can also be spotted before dawn at the antique stalls in Kempton Park Market, where she has acquired such objets déco as a convex mirror framed with mother-of-pearl, and her description of the scene sounds like advice for life in general: “You [have to] go with a torch and make decisions really quickly,” she says. “You don’t know what you’re buying—but you just have to hope that when the sun comes out, you will like it.” \nHair by Shon Hyungsun Ju at The Wall Group; makeup by Peter Philips for Christian Dior Makeup; manicure by Saloua Derbali for Manucurist; models: Ella Richards at Kate Moss Agency and Lucie de la Falaise; set design by Alexander Bock at Streeters; produced by Shape Production.\nThis article appears in the September 2023 issue of ELLE.\nGET THE LATEST ISSUE OF ELLE\nChantel Tattoli is a Paris-based, Florida-bred culture journalist whose work has recently appeared in T_he Paris Review_, Wired, the New York Times, THR, and the Porsche journal 000. \nCesar Chávez’s Granddaughter on the Biden Campaign\nPhoebe Dynevor Is in Her Fearless Era\nFall Is All About the Big Bag Theory\nRaul Lopez Is Doing It for the Culture\nBishme Cromartie’s Victory Means Something More\nHow Khaite Captured the Cool-Girl Crowd\nThe 1950s Are Back, at Least on the Runway\nMy So-Called #TradWife Life\nFashion Has a Case of Main Character Syndrome\nZendaya Holds Court\n‘Nobody Can Take Your Power’\nIt’s Livvy Dunne’s World\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Manolo Blahnik on The Craft Room, His Inspirations, and Designing for ‘Beautiful Women’", "date": "2023-10-02 13:00:00", "text": "The legendary shoemaker discusses his latest venture in the digital sphere.\nIn 2021, Manolo Blahnik introduced a virtual archive on its website where you can freely explore the world of the luxury shoemaker, from the eponymous designer’s first-ever silhouette to his muses and inspiration throughout the decades. And today, the brand adds a new room—The Craft Room—which showcases the incredible craftsmanship that goes into each covetable pair (including the Carrie Bradshaw-beloved Hangisi). Not only does it offer an unparalleled look into the world of fine shoemaking, with eight separate rooms dedicated to specific parts of the shoemaking journey—but it’s a celebration of all things Manolo, from its custom processes to the signature lace and buckles. \nTo properly unveil the new venture, Manolo Blahnik hosted an exclusive trip to its factory in Vigevano, Italy, bringing to life the journey from sketch to shoe. In Milan, ELLE had the privilege of visiting some of Blahnik’s favorite places, discovered where he finds inspiration for his collections, and even experienced a day in the factory to watch the full construction process and artisans at work firsthand. Below, the veteran founder discusses why he wanted to bring The Craft Room to life digitally, his muses, and more. \nThe whole experience is a big thank you to the artisans that I work with in the factories. I work so incredibly closely with all the wonderful artisans, and have done for almost 35 years. Craftsmanship is in their blood, passed down over generations. The Craft Room celebrates their work, and I hope it showcases that I would be nowhere without their magic hands. Also, the fact that it is online means anyone is able to see it from anywhere in the world. How exciting!\nFor me, everything starts with a sketch. I need to get it on paper first before anything else happens. I communicate through drawing. The next stage is speaking to the artisans in the factories so they can begin to build the shoe. The team there knows exactly what I am thinking, and strives to bring all my creations to life. Even with the most intricate and embellished designs, they are always pushing boundaries to ensure complete perfection and attention to detail. My inspiration comes from anywhere and everywhere! These days, I spend a lot of time in nature, and find I get a lot of inspiration from my surroundings.\nMy process has not changed at all! The sketch still comes first. I always carry my pens and paper with me so that when inspiration comes, I am always ready. Or else I forget it and the shoe is gone! I have been working with the artisans for so long, it’s like we have a secret language—they feel like family. I am so proud that we have been able to put family first in our business. We are a family that makes beautiful things that we hope make people smile. That’s the most important thing for me. \nIt is extremely important. Once we have decided on the shape and how the shoe will be made, we look into fabric and colors. Sometimes, the fabric and colors are so clear in my mind that the shoe must be made exactly how I envision it. Other times, the shoe needs some experimentation, some trial and error. Some fabrics will work, and others will not. When we see the right fabric and the right color for the right shoe, we know immediately—it’s a gut feeling. There is a collective gasp with the artisans!\nThere is not one type of Manolo muse, so I find it hard to define. Tina Chow was a muse of mine for so long, and I miss her dearly. The same with Anna Piaggi and Isabella Blow. I have so much to thank Diana Vreeland for. All of these women had the most extraordinary style, and that is something all of my muses seem to have in common. I simply love designing for beautiful women who have an enriched life.\nWe don’t call it “sustainability” because I feel sustainability is misunderstood. It’s binary—you either are, or you are not. We use the term  “responsibility” because it is a journey. There is a consistent, continuous, growing roadmap that we are on, looking at how we can improve and move forward. It’s a more realistic approach. We’re on that journey. We have a lot to do, but have had great success so far, and we are constantly striving to be better.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, which documents her journey performing her latest album, is coming to theaters in December. Now fans who didn’t get to catch the shows in person have a chance to join in on the fun—and those who’ve already been can relive the magic.\nShortly after completing her final tour stop in Kansas City on Sunday, Beyoncé announced the news with a trailer on social media. “Be careful what you ask for, ‘cause I just might comply,” she captioned the post, quoting “All Up in Your Mind” and perhaps winking at  fans who’ve been begging for Renaissance visuals for over a year. \nHere’s what to know.\nRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé opens in theaters on Dec. 1, 2023.\nIt will play exclusively in theaters. Tickets are available now on Fandango and AMC.\nWe still don’t know whether the film will stream sometime after the theatrical release. However, some of her past projects are online, like Homecoming on Netflix, Life Is but a Dream on Amazon Prime, or Black Is King on Disney+.\nBeyoncé shared a trailer on October 2. Footage shows her backstage, her team working behind the scenes, and her bonding with her family on the road. There are especially sweet glimpses at her daughter Blue Ivy stretching with her before a performance and her son, Sir, giving her a kiss.\nThe montages show fans gathering to watch her shows, too. (Maybe she wasn’t lying when she said, “You are the visuals,” after all.)

{"title": "Why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Weren’t Seen Together at the New York Jets Game", "date": "2023-10-02 15:03:00", "text": "Last night, Taylor Swift went out to support her new love interest Travis Kelce and his team the Kansas City Chiefs for the second week in a row at their game against the New York Jets. But unlike last week, there was no footage or photos of Swift and Kelce physically together. They left MetLife Stadium separately too, TMZ pointed out.\nNo photos have emerged so far of the two together or showing any PDA at Zero Bond, where Swift went post-game. It is not even clear at this point if Kelce joined her there. (At the very least, he wasn’t photographed leaving like she was.)\nNo paparazzi shots of them side-by-side in New York City this weekend have surfaced yet either. But Kelce and Swift did spend time together...in a more low-key way. \nKelce was photographed leaving Swift’s apartment on Sunday morning. A source told Page Six that the two didn’t have a sleepover, just a morning hangout. Kelce, the source said, adhered to his team’s 11 P.M. curfew on Saturday ahead of their Sunday game. Swift, meanwhile, got dinner with friends, including Sophie Turner, Brittany Mahomes, and Blake Lively.\nDespite being one of the biggest emerging celebrity couples in the world right now (and the talk of the NFL), Swift and Kelce successfully managed to keep their relationship more private. This change in approach isn’t too surprising, as both a source and Kelce himself spoke about the pair’s desire to keep things between them.\nKelce said on his podcast New Heights on Wednesday, “What’s real [about me and Swift] is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives. She’s not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like the McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\n“I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports…will kind of have to be where I keep it,” he said.\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime. So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "I Didn’t Think This Iconic Serum Could Get Any Better (I Was Wrong)", "date": "2023-10-02 16:00:00", "text": "Sulwhasoo’s First Care Activating Serum just got another major upgrade.\n When it comes to Korean skin-care brands, I’ve always considered Sulwhasoo the crème de la crème. Its products are known for cutting-edge innovation, cultural heritage, and a luxurious user experience—all at once. The company traces its roots to 1932, making it one of the oldest and most respected skin-care brands in K-beauty and worldwide, and in 1966, it became the first-ever beauty brand to formulate with ginseng. Since that time, Sulwhasoo has dedicated more than 50 years of research and technology to the ancient herb. So when I learned that the brand had finally added the star ingredient to its iconic First Care Activating Serum—a product I’ve used and adored for years—I couldn’t wait to give the new formulation a go. Here’s how the upgraded serum is leveling up my routine. \nNot-so-fun fact about yours truly: I have a chronic condition called Netherton syndrome that weakens my moisture barrier. So I’m always looking for skin-care products that help address dry patches. I was happy to find that the new formula is even better suited for this challenge. Sulwhasoo’s hyper-concentrated form of Korean ginseng extract is infused in its Sulwhasoo Master Complex™ to help strengthen the moisture barrier and boost skin’s natural abilities to function optimally. Following my usual routine with the product, I applied it on damp skin after cleansing and before moisturizing. After just a few weeks of use, I’ve noticed that my skin isn’t nearly as stressed or temperamental as usual. My tone appears more even, and my skin’s texture is visibly smoother. \nI just turned 30 and am starting to notice that my fine lines are getting deeper and my skin isn’t as firm as it used to be. In comes Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum VI, which utilizes the power of ginseng to address visible signs of aging, including loss of firmness, lack of hydration, and fine lines and wrinkles. As a beauty writer who has tried countless lackluster products that make these same claims, I appreciate that Sulwhasoo has the science to back them up: Its clinical studies showed that the formula improves the look of 10 signs of skin aging within four weeks.*  \nAnd for my part, I’ve definitely noticed that my laugh lines now appear minimized, and the skin around my eyes and jawline looks more taut. Overall, I love how bright and healthy my complexion looks.\nGet this: It took more than 26 years of research and development for Sulwhasoo to get this formula to where it is today. Worth the wait, the newest version has been shown to have better absorption and improved skin barrier strengthening properties. And while I’m not sure how the brand could possibly top this iteration, I bet it will find a way to keep impressing skin-care devotees like me for years to come. \n*Based on an 8-week clinical study on 30 women 39 to 60.\nThe Unifying Power of Latina Beauty\nThese Latina Icons Want to Talk Mental Health\nChristian Cowan Has Something New For Your Face\nThe Best Spring 2024 Makeup Trends \nWhat's the Deal with Probiotics? \nEverything You Need to Know About Lash Lifts\nThe 10 Best Collagen Supplements for Hair Growth \n13 Keratin Shampoos for Stronger, Shinier Hair\n17 Best Hair Thickening Products\nOur 20 Favorite Fragrances of All Time\n26 Beauty Gifts From Nordstrom To Buy Right Now\n25 Best Ulta Products According to ELLE Editors\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Jodie Turner-Smith Just Filed for Divorce From Joshua Jackson", "date": "2023-10-02 16:32:00", "text": "Jodie Turner-Smith and Joshua Jackson’s love story is coming to a surprise end, at least publicly. People and TMZ report that Turner-Smith filed for divorce from Jackson today in Los Angeles after more than three years of marriage. She cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reasoning, per TMZ.\nJackson and Turner-Smith share one daughter, who is three years old. Turner-Smith requested that they have joint custody of her and that neither party receive spousal support. TMZ reported that the two have a prenup. Laura Wasser is representing Turner-Smith in the divorce.\nJackson and Turner-Smith first started dating in 2018 after meeting at Usher’s 40th birthday party. In December 2019, they got married. The pair welcomed their daughter in April 2020.\nThe estranged couple was seen out together quite recently, attending J.Crew’s 40th Anniversary party side by side. They also went out to celebrate Turner-Smith’s 37th birthday that Saturday. Neither have commented on the divorce yet. This is both Turner-Smith’s and Jackson’s first marriage.\nIn December 2022, Turner-Smith spoke to Bustle about the impact that dating Jackson, who broke out on Dawson’s Creek, had on her own life. “The thing is I’m not actually that famous,” she said. “But people have looked at certain elements of my life, and those elements of my life have become subjects of tabloid and gossip.” \n“When I came onto the scene I was secretly married and I was secretly pregnant,” she said of when she first started making tabloid headlines. “And that was a story for people. I think a lot of it was because I was married to a white person. And I was married to a white person who has been in the public eye for decades and you know, has been someone that the tabloids like to talk about.” \nShe added later in the interview that she and Jackson work together to balance their careers and parenting. “Historically, women have always been asked to choose between being great mothers and great at their careers,” she said. “[But] Josh has always tried to maintain that I would always have all the support that I needed so that I could do both.” \n“Right now my daughter still comes with me most of the time, except when I go on trips that are under a week,” she continued. “That has been working for us so far. Obviously it’s challenging because I don’t want to create a space in which my husband can’t see her when he’s working.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

The talented 11-year-old has also continued to build her makeup skills, which her grandmother and Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, showed off in a recent Instagram video.\nIn the video, Knowles is wearing red lipstick and dramatic lashes, and she speaks into a mirror, saying, “Hi!

{"title": "Stevie Nicks Sent Her Original <i>Rumors</i> Outfit to Mattel to Help Create Her Barbie", "date": "2023-10-02 19:01:00", "text": "The music legend talks getting her own version of the iconic doll, her signature uniform, and her lasting legacy. \nStevie Nicks is taking this call from her flip phone. The septuagenarian rock icon does have an iPhone, but she mostly uses it to take photos. And lately, the photos have been of her new Barbie—as in, the just-launched Barbie that Mattel has fashioned in her likeness. \n“I’m photographing her everywhere we go. I was photographing her this morning sitting on a pillow looking out at Pittsburgh,” she tells ELLE.com, calling from her latest tour stop before heading to New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday (where she ultimately unveiled her Barbie). \nNicks has forged a legendary career for herself as both a member of Fleetwood Mac and a solo artist; she has won Grammys, been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice, sold millions of records worldwide, and inspired generations of musical artists after her. Having her own Barbie was something she “never thought” would happen. But now that Stevie Barbie (that’s what she calls her) is here, she can’t get enough of her. \n“I just continued my relationship with this little person. I don’t even look at her as a doll anymore. She’s like a real person. She came alive for me.” Nicks admits she props the doll up for photos as she travels from city to city on her tour, wraps her hair when she goes to bed, and talks to her to cheer herself up. “I just go, ‘Hello, Stevie Barbie, how are you doing today?’ She says to me, ‘I’m doing good. How are you doing?’ And that’s it. I feel a hundred percent better.”\nIn Nicks’ signature style, the doll carries a tambourine and wears a breezy black top with cape sleeves and a matching skirt, recreating the look she wears on Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors album cover. She actually lent the original ensemble—a French silk chiffon look by Margi Kent and 1977 handmade Italian boots by Di Fabrizio—to Mattel for reference. “I sent them the boots, which I would never ever let out of my sight before, and the outfit. I said, ‘This is it. This is the whole package.’”\nLooking back at how that now-iconic look materialized, Nicks says, “I went on the road for the first time with Fleetwood Mac in 1976 with just street clothes that I had bought when we joined Fleetwood Mac six months before. I’d actually had a little money to go out and buy some fun clothes. I got out there, and there was food out there, which there hadn’t been before, because we were very poor. All of a sudden I gained like 10, 15 pounds, and I didn’t fit in any of that stuff. When I came home, I had a friend who knew a designer and said, ‘Listen, you need to see Margi, because you need to have, like I said, a uniform.’”\nSo, Nicks sketched up a handkerchief skirt and wraparound blouse with long chiffon sleeves and collaborated with Kent on a design. “That is what I started wearing on stage, starting at the beginning of 1977, and continued to wear in all different skirt lengths,” she says. She’s been wearing it ever since.  \n“When I told Margi Kent, my designer, to make this outfit, I said to her, ‘I want a uniform, and by the way, I’m going to probably still be wearing this when I’m 60.’ Maybe it’ll be a little bigger, but basically this is what I’m going to wear for the next 50 years. She laughed, so funny, ha-ha. I said, ‘It’s not funny. It’s true.’”\nNicks’ Barbie partnership might come as a surprise, but it’s just another testament to her lasting influence. Forty-two years after her debut solo album Bella Donna (46 after Rumors and 50 after Buckingham Nicks), she continues to inspire not only pop culture as a whole, but notably, the youth. She has performed with Harry Styles and Taylor Swift; Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” went viral on TikTok; some women have likened her 1997 performance of “Silver Springs” (sung directly to ex and bandmate Lindsey Buckingham) to the Roman Empire; and her history with Fleetwood Mac gained new interest with the TV adaptation of Daisy Jones and the Six (which she has watched at least twice). Nicks shows no sign of slowing down, either. In the midst of her North American tour with Billy Joel, she just announced more show dates through next year.\n“When I look at her [the Stevie Barbie] now, I not only see my younger self … But I also see me at the age that I am now, which we’re not even going to mention that,” she says. “I see myself now in her a lot. That also really makes me happy and proud, and it makes me look at her and go, ‘This is what we did Barbie. We created a look. We created a persona, we created a character, we created a songwriter. We created what you wanted most.’”\nIn a way, Stevie the doll shows just how far Stevie the person has come. “It’s like we did everything that I wanted to do when I was 27.”\nNicks was a kid when she got her first and only Barbie doll in 1958, she recalls, but she didn’t find the toy relatable at the time. “She was the tall Barbie…and she was in her high heels and her beautiful striped bathing suit with her blonde hair on top of her head. I think I was only 11. It was like, huh, my mom’s five-foot tall, so even at 11, I’m going, ‘I don’t think I’m ever going to be as beautiful and as tall as Barbie.’ I didn’t quite understand it. I was just too young, honestly. I’m from a whole ’nother generation.” Her mother packed away that Barbie, but Nicks hopes to search for it one day when she gets back to Phoenix, where she and her parents lived. “I’m really looking forward to finding her, because I know that I’m just going to go like, ‘Oh my God, you just didn’t understand this beautiful Barbie, because you were just too little.’”\nLike many of us, Nicks watched the Barbie movie and loved it. She even has the Margot Robbie Barbie doll, which was released to promote the film. “I just love Margot Robbie. I’ve also taken thousands of pictures of my Margot Robbie Barbie, who is also my Barbie’s best friend now, because they sit next to each other all the time and talk in the silence of the night.”\nShe calls out some of her favorite scenes, like when Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie realizes her feet are flat or when she drives to the real world and realizes Ken is in her car. But she especially loves the scene where Weird Barbie makes Stereotypical Barbie choose between a pink heeled pump or a Birkenstock to learn the secrets of the universe.\nAs for which shoe she would choose, Nicks firmly responds: “Oh, Stevie is not a Birkenstock [person]. Stevie would find a pair of sandals that worked and were really good, but that were really cute and had a little ankle strap and could be a little bit fashionable. Had I been Margot Robbie Barbie, I would’ve had a lot of trouble making that choice too.”\nThe Stevie Nicks Music Series Barbie is available at Mattel Shop for $55 starting now. \nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe actress let ELLE.com in on her getting-ready process ahead of the Rabanne show.  \nNext time I attend Paris Fashion Week, remind me to take a page from Madelyn Cline’s book and do it with the same laid-back enjoyment that the actress emanated ahead of Rabanne’s spring/summer 2024 show.   \n“The environment is best described as chaotic good,” she tells me from her Paris hotel room, where she’s preening and primping with one of her best friends, her glam and styling teams, and photographer Jeff Thibodeau, who captured the morning exclusively for ELLE.com.  \nWhen Cline isn’t styling herself or being dressed by iconic fashion houses, she often works with celebrity stylist Mimi Cuttrell for events and red carpets. “I feel so lucky to work with her,” Cline says. “She also helps me pack sometimes, because I’m a mess.” She says mess, I say chaotic good. And she’s no mess at all, to be honest. Today, she’s well-rested and ready for fashion-fueled madness. In fact, she hasn’t done much other than chill out since landing in Paris. “I love laying in bed and rotting after traveling.”\nThe Outer Banks and Glass Onion star does love the City of Lights, though. Everything about it, she tells me. “Paris is so sexy, and the energy during fashion week is perfection.” \n“I’m so excited for the show,” Cline adds. “I love Rabanne’s unconventional use of materials to create almost otherworldly designs...Rabanne, to me, feels very ethereal. Almost fever dreamlike.”\nFor the big event, she chose a light pink and purple frock (by Rabanne, naturally). It’s lacy, semi-sheer in portions, and printed. She exclaims: “I’ve never seen anything like it, and it’s comfy!” Accessories were kept to a minimum, allowing the dress to take center stage. \n\nInstead of dripping in jewels, she wears Fame, a Rabanne fragrance. “It’s very Parisian and it’s a little incense-y.” She picks up on its notes of jasmine, like the kind that grew in her backyard as a kid. \n “We always start with music and food,” she says. Cline describes her getting-ready playlist for me, which includes Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO, along with other bangers from Missy Elliot, Dua Lipa, and, of course, the Ken song. As for the food, the menu is “champagne and hash browns.” Only the finest. \nDespite swirling rumors about her love life as of late, Cline conducts herself like a true girl’s girl (as evidenced by the hash browns). When I ask what her ideal Parisian date night would entail, she answers: a girl’s night in. “Or out. Maybe both.” \nClick through Cline’s getting-ready diary for the Rabanne SS24 show at Paris Fashion Week in our gallery below:\nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "All About Malcolm McRae, Anya Taylor-Joy’s Husband", "date": "2023-10-02 19:26:00", "text": "Anya Taylor-Joy has kept her personal life as private as she can manage as her Hollywood profile grows. But ahead of The Queen’s Gambit actress’s Saturday Night Live hosting gig in May 2021, Taylor-Joy was photographed making out with musician Malcolm McRae in New York City. The photos sparked dating rumors—and come after Taylor-Joy spoke about having a partner in her ELLE May 2021 interview.\nTaylor-Joy didn’t initially explicitly confirm that she and McRae are dating, but they didn’t exactly hide their romantic connection in the city. According to Page Six, the two were seen holding hands and kissing multiple times while walking around the Big Apple.\nIn September 2021, the two were photographed kissing again, this time in Venice. And in March 2022, Taylor-Joy spoke about her romance with McRae in an interview and made her red carpet debut with him at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party. In July 2022, the two went further, secretly tying the knot, a source told Page Six. The two ultimately made their first award show debut as a couple at the Golden Globes in January 2023.\nIn September 2023, the Daily Mail reported they would be having their wedding in Italy. Photos came out on Monday, October 2 of the Venice festivities.\nHere, all about McRae’s career and what's known about his relationship with Taylor-Joy.\nPer McRae’s IMDB bio, McRae “was ‘discovered’ at the AMTC (talent competition) among 1,100 hopeful actors at age 12, where he won Over All Young Actor, 2006.” McRae starred in a short film, Brotherly, in 2008 and played Gene Grady in 2020’s How'dy!.\nMusic is McRae’s real focus though. His IMDB bio cites him as playing “guitar and piano” and singing “pop, folk, rockabilly, rock and musical theatre.” On his Instagram, McRae plugs his rock band More’s music, most recently posting footage of himself playing his song “Settled In” in April.\nMore is a two-member group that McRae and Kane Ritchotte (formerly of Portugal The Man) created and that is signed with Warner Records. The band is verified on Spotify and has been together for over three years now. They released the first half of their two-part EP, 1/2, last summer.\nIn a July 2020 interview with Rain magazine, McRae spoke about his history with Ritchotte and the creation process for 1/2. “The writing process was a span over three or so years,” he said. “Kane and I were doing solo projects individually and had a few songs we had written and recorded separately. We met up and decided it was fun to write together and bring our songs together. So we finished 10 songs over about three years.”\nAccording to More’s Spotify bio, McRae came to Los Angeles from the South a few years ago. As the band wrote, “Malcolm had only recently fallen in love with a young woman and followed his foolish heart, dropping everything to move to Los Angeles. Well, his heart was mistaken. The relationship was a disaster. But the music that followed wasn’t. Within a week of meeting, the two [McRae and Ritchotte] realized that the music they made together transcended what either was doing alone.”\nMcRae spoke to American Songwriter 10 months ago about how he worked as a paralegal in Pasadena, California, and wrote song lyrics for “Elaborate Attraction” while at his desk job.\nIn his Rain interview, McRae spoke more about the inspiration behind “Elaborate Attraction” and how his late father influenced its lyrics. “My dad was an investment banker,” McRae said. “He passed away when I was eighteen, but that song revolves around and is based on some of his life. He studied classics at an Ivy League school and so the reference to Joseph Campbell, that’s what we took the video from. We wanted it to be an antihero’s journey. All 17 points of Campbell’s hero journey… we wanted to make them super menial tasks with an incredibly small reward for each task. It symbolizes what the song is about which is nature versus nurture.” McRae’s brother Keene McRae directed the music video for the single, and its YouTube video has gotten more than 93,000 views.\nMcRae told Rain that music helped him and Ritchotte get through the coronavirus pandemic mental health-wise. “I’m grateful for the outlet and you don’t need many resources to write music, you know?” he said. “If we didn’t have that in this quarantine, I would be entirely morbidly depressed and unfulfilled. I mean, I don’t know how anybody’s survived. I don’t know how not everybody is writing an album right now.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae’s exact timeline is not clear nor has either explicitly confirm they're dating. But the 26-year-old actress spoke to ELLE three days after the Golden Globes, indicating she had a significant other in March 2021 while explaining why she was doing her Zoom interview from her bathroom.\n“My partner’s just come back from work, and he’s moving around all of his equipment, so this was the safe spot,” she said. She didn’t offer any more details on who he is, how long they’ve been together, and didn’t confirm outright that they were living together.\nTaylor-Joy did open up to Vanity Fair earlier this year about a past relationship ending right before she began production on Emma in March 2019, meaning her relationship with McRae is likely more recent.\n“Prior to filming [Emma] I’d just had a devastating breakup, and it had challenged everything,” she said. “I was just incredibly insecure and very, very unsafe in my own skin.” Taylor-Joy had been working constantly during that time, immersing herself in the characters she played while not taking the time to learn about who she is.\nShe could go into an art gallery and recognize the pieces each character she played would like, “but I had no idea what I liked,” she said. “I had no clue of what I would choose for myself. I’m sitting here talking to you, and for the first time, I’m like, I know what I like. I know what I, as a person, enjoy!… The whole of 2019 was me becoming a woman, essentially.”\nOn July 23, The Sun reported that McRae “has practically moved into [Taylor-Joy’s] L.A. home.”\n“They are inseparable and spend all of their time together,” a source close to Taylor-Joy told the outlet. “Her schedule is really hectic because she is so in demand following The Queen’s Gambit, but he is always there for her.”\nThe source added that “Malcolm is practically living with her at her home in L.A. now, and they spend every night together.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae proved their relationship was still going strong post-Labor Day when the two were photographed kissing in Venice by paparazzi. Taylor-Joy was at the festival to promote her upcoming film Last Night in Soho.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy posed side-by-side at Vanity Fair’s Oscars after-party. Taylor-Joy was dressed in a black sheer Dior corset dress alongside her partner.\n\nAhead of their Oscars red carpet debut, Taylor-Joy reflected on dating McRae to British Vogue in her cover story with them. “I said to my partner [the musician and actor Malcolm McRae] the other day that he was my hobby,” she said. “I see reading as something that I have to do. He loved it because he’s the same. I’ve finally found someone who will happily sit in silence with me reading. We’re basically 80 years old and seven at the same time and it works really well.”\nShe reflected on being long distance with him, as she owns a house in east London and is regularly traveling for film projects. “Yes, it is [hard], but it’s also kind of great because when you’re together you’re really valuing the time that you have. Everyday mundane activities are so full of joy. I love going to the petrol station with him and filling up the car and going to get breakfast.”\nCasual dating just wasn’t her style either, she added: “I was not a good dater and I’m quite glad to not be. I hear stories from my friends and I’m like, ’God, I would suck at that.’” \nTaylor-Joy and McRae didn't shy away from showcasing their love for each other during the screening for her film The Northman on April 5 in London. Both dressed chicly, Taylor-Joy and McRae kissed in front of photographers in one of their most public displays of affection yet.\nIn a subtle sign of their ties to each other, both Taylor-Joy and McRae follow each other on Instagram. Until recently, neither Taylor-Joy nor McRae posted about each other though or liked the other’s Instagram posts, but Taylor-Joy recently tagged McRae in a photo implying he was at the scene. Then McRae went Instagram official!\nOn October 20, 2021, McRae shared two shots of he and Taylor-Joy standing in a window’s reflection, smiling and holding hands. He captioned it, “Oof supremely happy.”\nIn the photos, Taylor-Joy is wearing a red razor-back tank top with white piping, and a long checkered shirt over it, her blonder hair pushed back with a pair of sunglasses. McRae is in a white t-shirt and black jeans. \nTaylor-Joy was photographed arriving at the Sydney airport in Australia in late June via private jet. As she reached up to brush her hair from her face, a sparkling rock was spotted on her ring finger. Rumors quickly spread that she is engaged to McRae.\nA person at the scene said, “She bounded off the plane and then seemed to flash the ring at her driver before getting in the car. She was either showing off the ring or doing a dance move. Either way, she looked ecstatic.”\nHer plane outfit included matching purple slacks and shirt and she was carrying her new cat, Kitsune, in a backpack with a window for her pet to enjoy the scene.\nTaylor-Joy and McRae may secretly be husband and wife. A source told Page Six that the couple quietly got married in an intimate courthouse wedding. On July 18, Taylor-Joy was photographed walking with McRae, wearing her engagement ring on her left ring finger. Neither McRae, Taylor-Joy, or Taylor-Joy's rep have yet to commented on the wedding reports as of July 19.\nOn Thursday, September 1, Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McCrae enjoyed a little PDA as they walked through the streets of Los Angeles during a heat wave. The couple held hands as they walked, and were photographed embracing and sharing a kiss here and there on their date night in West Hollywood.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a pale pink sundress with a square neckline with flower details down the front for each button. She carried a green sweater over her left hand, which obscured any potential sighting of a wedding or engagement ring. McRae was wearing a vintage green Nascar shirt over khaki pants.  \nTaylor-Joy and McRae were seen in Sydney's center for a Saturday night out, leaving popular party spot Frankie's in two stylish ensembles. The actress was wearing a bright purple mini dressed with a leather jacket and lace-up boots. She left her long blonde hair loose down her back, and wore dark red lipstick. By her side, McRae was rocking a grown out shag and a green turtleneck under a blazer with jeans. \nThe actress has been filming in Australia since may for the film Furiosa, of which she is the lead. After leaving the night club, they were escorted into a car and headed off.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, October 18, the couple enjoyed a lunch in Sydney at Mark And Vinny's spaghetti. As they waited for their food to arrive, they couldn't keep their hands off each other, leaning in to steal kisses and hug. At one point, McRae even gave Taylor-Joy's hand a chivalrous kiss in a romantic gesture.\nThe actress was wearing a vivid with matching lipstick and a pair of white mules with black designs. She covered it in a navy bomber jacket and pair of cat eye sunglasses. McRae was dressed in black jeans, a white t-shirt, and a grey button down over it. \nOn Sunday, December 25, Anya Taylor-Joy shared a glimpse of her holiday plans on Instagram, posting pictures of herself in bed with MacRae. \nMacRae was wearing a dark sleeping mask up on his forehead, and Taylor-Joy seemed to be in a fluffy white hat with ear flaps. On closer inspection, it is actually a white cat with gray ears. They both cuddled under the white sheets of their bed, looking sleepy and happy. \n“Merry Christmas to all you filthy animals, from our home to yours,” she wrote in the caption. \nThe couple made their award show debut on January 10, posing together at the Golden Globes, where Taylor Joy was a nominee. They showed PDA in front of the photographers.\nTaylor-Joy was photographed on Sunday, January 15, with McRae backstage at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles, held at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel. The actress was presenting an award at the ceremony alongside Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller. The couple were photographed sharing an intimate moment before the festivities where McRae appears to be adjusting her necklace.\nFor the event, Taylor-Joy wore a sheer, nude netted dress over a matching body-suit of opaque fabric and had her long hair piled into a tall knotted updo. She accessorized with diamond jewelry around her neck and one wrist and a pair of sandal heels with a rhinestone strap across her toes. McRae was wearing a traditional suit with an untraditional ribbon cravat under a white button-down shirt.\nTaylor-Joy gave her partner a romantic shoutout on her Instagram on Valentine's Day 2023, sharing footage of them kissing, and writing, “Mi amor, I'm all yours.”\nTen days after, the couple was photographed holding hands while out at London's Chiltern Firehouse on February 24, 2023. Taylor-Joy had been in town for the BAFTA Awards that previous weekend.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy put their couple style on display and signaled things were on and strong between them when they attended the Tiffany & Co The Landmark store reopening in New York City on April 27, 2023. Taylor-Joy wore a red lace dress while McRae was dressed in a black suit with a black choker.\nOn Thursday, Taylor-Joy and McRae were seen walking outside a friend's house in Los Angeles. It appeared that the musician was comforting the Queen's Gambit star, wrapping her arms around her and kissing her forehead. The pair arrived at the house with guitars and were accompanied by McRae's bandmate Kane Ritchotte.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a sleeveless white top and an asymmetrical mini skirt and black leather Maison Margiela loafers. \nTaylor-Joy and McRae never specified if they were actually married. Multiple sources close to the couple told the Daily Mail on September 29 that they would be wedding that weekend in Italy in front of 150 guests.\nA source said, “Anya and Malcolm are incredibly private and wanted to ensure their wedding was kept away from prying eyes. They both love Italy and always dreamed of tying the knot in a beautiful setting surrounded by their nearest and dearest. There will be no expense spared and their guests are bound to have an incredible time.”\nTaylor-Joy appeared in a beige gown embellished with birds and flowers in photos of her posing on a window balcony. She wore her platinum hair half up, half down with a white veil. Guests included Cara Delevingne, Julia Garner, Nicolas Hoult, and Miles Teller.\nNeither Taylor-Joy nor McRae have confirmed news of their wedding themselves or shared official photos yet.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nExosome therapy has dermatologists and plastic surgeons rethinking the future of aesthetics.\nWhen Jennifer Levine would visit aquariums as a little girl, she would spend hours watching starfish slowly tumble across the glass. Starfish are naturally intriguing to children, but it was their ability to regrow arms that really fascinated young Jennifer. These days, Levine—she grew up to become a leading New York City plastic surgeon—can do just about any aesthetic procedure. But it is dermatology’s newest hot topic, exosome therapy, that reminds her of the starfish she grew up watching, with their magically regenerative bodies. \nExosomes are nano-size vesicles (sort of like little care packages) that cells excrete to communicate with each other. They are packed with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, like messenger RNA. In aesthetics, they are generally sourced from stem cells, specialized cells that have the ability to develop into many other types of cells. Exosomes have been explored in regenerative medicine to repair cartilage and joints, and many doctors now believe exosomes hold promise for regenerating and repairing skin, and even restoring hair growth.\nThe idea is that when injected or used topically, exosomes might help skin not only look better, but also behave like younger skin on a deep cellular level. As we grow older, our body’s ability to heal, including its power to produce collagen, decreases. “We’ve seen that [exosomes] have anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties and signal cells to do things they’re supposed to do—like make more collagen. It leads to an improvement in skin texture, thickness, and quality,” says Catherine Chang, MD, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and founder of Privé Beverly Hills. Exosomes are not yet FDA approved (in July 2020, the agency issued a consumer alert on them and other stem-cell-derived products), and some experts feel that we’re years out from FDA approval, but that hasn’t stopped doctors from dreaming big.\n“It could be bigger than Botox, and the Holy Grail in anti aging,” says Steven H. Williams, MD, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Compared to bio-stimulatory tools such as Sculptra and radio frequency, which also encourage collagen production, exosome therapy can stimulate growth without creating an injury, or swelling, that requires healing. And in contrast to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, its most commonly compared-to cousin, exosomes can contain more growth factors and are somewhat more widely available. The platelets for PRP need to be spun from an individual patient’s own blood and will contain fewer growth factors as patients age, but exosomes can be derived from plants, animals, or humans, and even from donated blood or fat, and are, in that sense, ageless. \nAnecdotally, Chang and Levine, who both offer exosome therapy topically in their practices, tell me that they and their patients have been blown away by the results. Chang used it herself following a CO2 laser treatment and found that it decreased her redness from seven days to one. One of her patients, who’d  been trying to regrow her hair for a couple of years, excitedly came in following one exosome session and showed Chang her new hair. Levine has used it on patients to help heal things like stitching wounds, deep skin gashes from running falls in Central Park, and a large bruise from an airport luggage accident. \nIt’s precisely because exosomes can be so powerful that Williams says we need more research on them. Among many other recent studies on exosomes, a review of early preclinical research in the August 2022 Journal of Dermatologic Surgery found that they have promising skin rejuvenation and hair growth effects, but that inconsistency in the ways they are purified, and practical issues with how they are sourced, stored, scaled, and reproduced, are hindering their adoption in the clinical sphere. Jason Diamond, MD, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, cautions, “The biggest factor is making sure that they come from a reputable lab, because there can be contamination and infection risks, and they’re frankly hard to produce consistently.” Outside of beauty, there’s the potential that exosomes could one day be used for delivery of antibiotics or even anticancer agents, he notes. Still, Williams adds that because exosomes affect communication between cells, we need more studies to better understand the likelihood of scenarios in which they could trigger cell signaling problems and result in outcomes like undesired cell replication, cell death, or cancer.\n“It also seems that some people are taking advantage of some of the excitement about it to try to get some economic gain, and that’s not always in the patient’s best interest,” he cautions. It’s easy to find clinics and wellness centers offering exosome therapy at prices varying from $60 to $6,000. But if you don’t know the right questions to ask, you could be wasting your money (at the very least). For example, Williams explains, fat-derived exosomes are generally the easiest to obtain. But “if you’re trying to use a fat-derived exosome for hair growth, you’re probably not going to see results, because it’s a different signaling mechanism: You’re trying to communicate with a different part of the cell to influence it.” There are also new skincare serums, purported to contain exosomes. Barbara Sturm has a line of Exoso-metic skincare, with \"exosome and growth factor activated ingredients.\" Celebrity esthetician Angela Caglia's new Cell Forté Serum uses a mix of real human-derived exosomes mixed with synthetic exosomes, cytokines, and epidermal growth factors. Caglia tells me that since developing the serum, her hyperpigmentation has cleared much faster, and her skin has been brighter than she's ever seen it. \nMany dermatologists have heard of exosome therapy from conferences and studies— and like many skin innovations, it’s been available in South Korea for a few years. Young Woo Ro, MD, founder of the renowned Oracle dermatology clinic in Seoul, tells me he first heard of it in aesthetics about five years ago. In South Korea, exosomes are a common add-on to Fraxel or microneedling, where the microchannels help them get into deeper layers of the skin. Exosome skin boosters are another popular treatment, containing a cocktail of ingredients like hyaluronic acid, amino acids, collagen peptides, and glutathione, for additional “brightening, firming effects,” says David Kim, MD, of Idriss Dermatology in New York City. He tells me that ASCE+ is a popular exosome product; the subtype SRLV is for skin and HRLV is for hair, and both contain exosomes derived from roses.\nWhen I visited Seoul for the first time this spring, I was surprised by the number of dermatology and plastic surgery clinics and saw signs touting the ability to “bank” your stem cells for future use at certain luxury clinics. This could be common in the future, according to Chang. “I suspect we’re going to get to a place where you can harvest stem cells, whether it’s from bone marrow or fat, and then you can send it to get processed and banked for you down the road.” Think of it sort of like beauty wealth management. \nTo get continued results, this wouldn’t be a one-time treatment. The recommended frequency varies: Kim and Ro both say that it’s recommended in Korea to get an incredible five injection sessions of exosome skin boosters over two weeks.  But Levine suggests that since exosomes can stimulate your body to produce its own collagen, the effect could last longer. For hair, she recommends treatment roughly once a year. If you want a combination of immediate and long-term results, exosomes can be combined with filler or microneedling. \n“We’re just at the tip of the iceberg,” Levine says. “This is certainly the direction that the field of aesthetics is going into.” Williams agrees, but worries about that iceberg. “Science shows that there’s something there, but we’re not sure what it is. That doesn’t mean that physicians can’t use non-FDA-approved treatments. But they need to be a little bit more careful. Patients should always be cautious about being the first one ever to try something. Sometimes it doesn’t work out as well.”\nEditor’s Note: This article does not constitute individual medical advice, and you should consult with your doctor before deciding if certain cosmetic or medical treatments are right for you.\nA version of this story appears in the November 2023 issue of ELLE.\nKathleen Hou is ELLE\"s Beauty Director.

{"title": "What Happened Between Uche, Aaliyah, and Lydia on <i>Love Is Blind</i> Season 5?", "date": "2023-10-02 20:14:00", "text": "The trio caused quite a stir in the pods.\nSpoilers below.\nThe fifth season of Love Is Blind has finally arrived, and new episodes are juicier than ever. As usual, some couples find love in the pods, but a prior relationship also threatens to wreck one of the new romances.\nICU travel nurse Aaliyah seemingly finds love with lawyer Uche in the pods. However, an emotional revelation from Uche completely throws Aaliyah off, making her question the burgeoning romance. Here’s what you need to know about the surprising love triangle between Aaliyah, Uche, and Lydia on Love Is Blind season 5.\nAt the end of season 5, episode 3, Uche emotionally opened up to Aaliyah with a secret he hadn’t revealed before. “There’s something I have to tell you,” he explained. “I haven’t been completely honest with you. One of my dates on the first day, I walked into the pod, and it is a girl that I have dated in the past. And, um, it’s Lydia.” The episode ended on this mic drop, with Aaliyah clearly shocked that Lydia, with whom she’d developed a close friendship, had previously dated Uche.\nEpisode 4 delved deeper into the love triangle, showing us Lydia and Uche’s first pod dates, in which they quickly realized that they knew one another. Lydia excitedly asked Uche, “Do you want to start at zero?” However, Uche responded, “I don’t think we can do that, because I kind of, it ruins the experiment.” He also admitted, “This really caught me off guard.” While Lydia seemed keen to continue talking to Uche, he essentially shut down any possibility of a second chance.\nCutting back to Aaliyah and Uche’s date, Uche said of his relationship with Lydia, “We dated for a few months. I just didn’t think that we were that compatible so I ended things. It hurt me so much because she deserves an amazing person who is completely sure about her, and I really hope she finds that.” Aaliyah started crying, clearly shell-shocked that her close friend Lydia had previously dated the man she was now falling in love with. \nAs for whether or not he was still considering Lydia as an option, Uche reassured Aaliyah, saying, “That’s over with ... I went back and forth about it for a long time, because I do see a lot of qualities that would make her a good wife. She seemed 100 percent into me, and I thought if I can’t give her 100 percent back, then I don’t want to hurt her.” \nAfter stepping outside the pod for a moment, Aaliyah returned and revealed to Uche, “[Lydia]’s been making comments. She’s been saying things and I’m like, ‘How do you know this?’” Aaliyah continued, “She’s been telling me multiple times, like, ‘I just see myself in you. We are almost the same woman, you know? It’s just weird.”\nBack in the women’s quarters, Aaliyah revealed to Lydia that she’d found out about her prior relationship with Uche. The pair embraced and cried, telling one another how much they loved each other.  However, the conversation became uncomfortable when Lydia started revealing personal details about Uche, telling Aaliyah, “I know everything about him because I know him.” Even though Aaliyah firmly said that she didn’t want to know anything about Uche because she wanted to discover it for herself, Lydia couldn’t help but spill the details.  \nLydia started talking about Uche’s dog, Kobe, telling Aaliyah that Kobe “pees every time he sees me.” Lydia also revealed that she’d met Uche's friends, saying, “I’m sure you’re going to get along.” She also called Uche a “workaholic,” said that he was “OCD,” that he drove a Tesla, and revealed that his three-level “house was dope.” She even revealed Uche’s favorite color. With each new revelation, Aaliyah looked more and more uncomfortable. \nFinally, Lydia dropped the bombshell that she’d last slept with Uche in January of that year, only months before they’d entered the pods. In a confessional, Aaliyah said, “You had sex three months ago, and I’m supposed to feel like that’s no big deal?” She also revealed, “I'm struggling with the fact he left out a lot of details. I get Lydia’s story and it includes a lot more detail than I would have liked.”\nAfter hearing Lydia’s side of the story, Aaliyah joined Uche in the pods, and she was clearly distressed about what she’d learned. “On the outside world, I would never date a friend’s ex. I would never befriend your ex,” she told him. Uche’s response did nothing to calm Aaliyah fears, with him asking, “You don’t think this is hard for me? I mean it’s happening to me just as much, or even more, than it’s happening to you.” Aaliyah responded, “No it’s not, because I’m over here sitting with your ex that you fucked three months ago. She’s telling me things that I didn’t want to know from her.” \nUche tried to persuade Aaliyah that they could make it work, in spite of the Lydia curve ball. They ended the date choosing each other, with Uche revealing that he had every intention of proposing. However, when he returned to the pod to propose, Aaliyah wasn’t there. Production intervened, telling Uche, “Unfortunately, Aaliyah’s decided not to continue with the experiment.” \nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Aaliyah opened up about her decision to leave the pods before Uche proposed, saying, “I had this gut feeling after really analyzing my interactions with Uche, Lydia, getting all the facts and things, or at least hearing both sides of that situation.” She continued, “Being engaged, it’s a sacred thing to experience and you’re sharing that with family, friends, people I love dearly and that love me dearly. It was something I felt was best for me moving forward.”\nAfter finding out that Aaliyah had left the experiment, Uche spoke to her on the phone during a confessional in episode 5. She explained that she had “an exchange of words” with Lydia, which resulted in Aaliyah saying Lydia could have Uche back if he didn't propose. Aaliyah then went on to reveal that she felt as though Lydia smothered her, and wouldn't stop speaking about Uche in conversation. Tearfully, Aaliyah apologized to Uche for leaving.\nUche then asked her, “Why didn’t you stay here and talk to me?” She revealed that she still loved him. However, he was angry that she left, and cast doubt on their relationship, telling her, “If you can’t get through something like this, we would never get to that point.” He continued, “I can’t believe some girl said something to you and you let that come in between us.” \nAaliyah then suggested that Lydia knew that Uche was going to be on the show and applied as a result. Uche was angry about this suggestion, and called Aaliyah selfish for leaving. “You didn’t even write me a letter,” he told her. “I’ve got nothing.” Uche then said he “let himself get close to the wrong person,” then told production, “I don’t wanna talk to her” and hung up. \nOutside of the pods, Uche and Aaliyah met in a restaurant to talk, shown in episodes 6 and 7. “I do regret, I regret leaving you like that,” Aaliyah told Uche. “I do love you. Like, never felt the connection that you and I have with any other man.” She also revealed that she still wanted to be in a relationship with Uche. “I would marry you,” she told him. \nUnfortunately, Uche was not receptive to Aaliyah's declaration. “When I found out that you had left, it’s like I broke,” he told her. “... You didn’t communicate any kind of doubt to me.” Aaliyah revealed that the doubts started when she discovered Uche’s past relationship with Lydia. She also felt awkward that Lydia revealed too much information about her past with Uche.  \nUche then started to explain the problems in his past relationship with Lydia, revealing that she'd invaded his privacy while they were dating. However, after she apologized, he decided to give her a second chance. Soon after, some of Uche’s friends reached out claiming that Lydia had been watching their Instagram Stories for weeks, despite not knowing them. He continued, “The worst thing was, she drives over to my house, she takes a picture of my driveway and she texts it to me with a message that says, ‘I see you.’ And I panicked.” Uche initially cut Lydia off, but started talking to her again as she had experienced a loss, before breaking up with her once more.\nUche admitted he should have told Aaliyah about his experiences with Lydia while in the pods. He explained, “Maybe Lydia still likes this guy, she’s still obsessed with him, maybe she doesn’t have the best intentions when it comes to me, and maybe you would’ve been able to have your guard up a little bit more.” Aaliyah said that Uche’s seeming concern for Lydia and Milton’s relationship made her uneasy, and made her wonder if Uche still had feelings for Lydia. Aaliyah also revealed that Lydia had told some fellow contestants that she thought someone she’d previously dated was also on Love Is Blind, suggesting she had planned to reconnect with Uche.\nWhile Aaliyah wanted to continue her relationship with Uche, he said that he had doubts about whether they could make it work, and walked away.\nAt a party for the contestants, shown in episode 7, Uche pulled Lydia aside and confronted her about their romance. The conversation quickly descended into an argument, with Uche suggesting that Lydia had been going through his possessions in his house. He later brought up Lydia's alleged Instagram behavior, suggesting that she’d been following his friends. She denied it, and accused Uche of sleeping with someone else while they were together. Lydia stormed off, and Uche found Milton to have a conversation.\nAmy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.

{"title": "A Hot Girl’s Guide to the Best Amazon Halloween Costumes", "date": "2023-10-02 20:18:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nBuying something I’ll never wear again? Now that’s scary.  \nThe best time of year is upon us. It’s the season for candy corn, slasher flicks, and letting cobwebs pass as decor (when really, you just need to dust). If you haven’t sorted out your Halloweekend outfits yet, don’t fret. We have lots of cute costume ideas here at ELLE, but I’m here to break down a few easy Halloween costumes from Amazon. Conveniently, the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days savings event is coming up on October 10 and 11, so you can score these items at an even better price.  \nThese are mostly made of things you A) already own, or B) need to purchase but could totally re-wear. As much as I love costume stores, I’m not interested in buying a sexy Bob Ross getup because when could I possibly wear that other than this one day a year? If you’re looking for an affordable and simple look that’s still chic and Instagrammable, look no further. Here, find 10 easy Halloween costumes you can get on Amazon. \nIconic characters like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz tend to make for fantastic Halloween costumes that can be worn again. Judy Garland and this character will always be timeless, and thus a trusty option for that costume party. I personally have this gingham dress for my own dress-up purposes and can attest that it’s just as cute on October 31 as it is paired with white sneakers during the summer months. But as Dorothy, try these sweet ballet flats that are very much aligned with our favorite fall 2023 shoe trends. \nAs the song goes, “Miracles happen once in a while, if you believe.” The miracle I’m personally willing into existence is that I might do as good of a job as Hailey Bieber did when she dressed up as the girl next door-turned-princess Mia Thermopolis. It’s an all-time look for an all-time movie. And if you’re looking to make a group costume out of this, there are plenty of other endearing characters to rope your friends into (including Anne Hathaway’s pre-makeover look from Paolo).  \nThis might be a hot take, but here’s where I stand. Black cat ears: Basic. Witch: Failsafe. I can’t quite spell out the reasoning behind this, but I stand by it. A witch is a nod to the holiday’s very essence, as well as an homage to a long history of fierce women. Plus, this might be the easiest to throw together last minute. If you’re like me, you have ample black garments in your wardrobe to choose from. Make this the year you buy a pointy black hat and keep it on hand for all the Octobers to come. If you do actively practice witchcraft, even better (but it’s not a prerequisite). \nShe’s the blueprint for all the baddies. And she’s just plain cool as hell. If I had darker hair or could pull off a wig, this costume would be at the top of my list. Not only are her look and vibe totally sexy and chic, but Betty Boop is also not a very common costume. In the realm of cool girl costume dressing, uniqueness is a virtue. You aren’t likely to see a slew of fellow Betties, and if you did, that would actually be pretty rad. \nFor the gals who aren’t sold on the idea of dressing up at all, might I suggest this uber-cozy option? It requires minimal effort and will keep you warm and comfortable while your pals shiver in their Little Red Riding Hood frocks. Personally, half the time I ditch a party it’s because I don’t want to change out of my sweats. As the Pink Panther, you don’t have to. And you get to pretend to be a jewel thief—how fun! \nLet me address the elephant in the nerd-filled room. A lightsaber wasn’t really part of Leia’s get-up—she was more of the blaster type—but I still think you can get away with this if for no reason other than recognizability. The dress and belt could easily be worn time and time again, and space buns are a simple enough hairdo. If you’re raiding your brother’s room to borrow the lightsaber he already owns, make sure it’s blue. This is your only hope of successfully clapping back at anyone who tries to mansplain that Leia didn’t carry a lightsaber. If someone gives you a hard time about this detail, just tell them to check their facts, because Leia technically does use a blue lightsaber to train with Luke in an episode IX flashback. (And thank you, to my boyfriend for all this information.) \nYou could lean into the Tinkerbell of it all if you’re so inclined, but you can also decide to be your own kind of pixie, whatever that looks like for you. Honestly, almost any cottagecore-adjacent outfit will do for this one. Floral dress? Sure. Just pop on those wings and call it a day. But I do draw the line at those pointy elf ear accessories; The best I can do is pointed-toe shoes. Final offer. \nEverybody dresses up as the Scooby-Doo gang. Skip Daphne or Velma, and instead go for the less overdone option of Nancy Drew, the original woman in STEM. Pretty much any solid-colored top or sweater will do the trick. Pair it with a pencil skirt or pedal pushers in true Nancy Drew form.\n\nElizabeth James is one of the top 10 onscreen mothers, according to no one other than myself. This low-lift idea comes from ELLE’s senior video producer Laura Hacker, and it requires hardly anything at all. The primary components are a button-down shirt, sunglasses, and a hair roller. You can decide whether you want to talk in a posh British accent and quote this Natasha Richardson character all evening, but I strongly recommend it. \n Okay...I have a confession. I have not seen The White Lotus. I know, I know; I’m terribly out of touch. But not so out of touch that I would overlook such a glaringly obvious costume idea. Pop culture or current zeitgeist costumes can be a total trap because you risk looking like a bandwagoner. But I do believe that Tanya makes an excellent costume inspiration. For that matter, any Jennifer Coolidge character is an excellent idea. \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-02 21:10:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAfter Coldplay's Chris Martin consciously uncoupled back in 2014 with his partner of a decade Gwyneth Paltrow, his dating life became decidedly more private. Martin seems to have finally  found lasting love with Dakota Johnson after previously being linked to actresses including Jennifer Lawrence and Annabelle Wallis. \nAlthough they've kept their relationship low-key, they celebrated three years together this past October. Here, a rundown of the romance.\nRumors of a relationship first arose when Johnson and Martin were spotted grabbing dinner at Sushi Park in Los Angeles. According to a People onlooker, the pair appeared \"cozy, laughing and affectionate\" during the outing.\nBy mid-November fans clocked Johnson at Coldplay's Buenos Aires, Argentina concert. Lainey Gossip noted that it was the last show of the band's Head Full Of Dreams tour—and that Johnson was viewing the show from a VIP-level vantage point.\nThe following month, multiple sources confirmed to Us Weekly that the potential couple was together. \"Dakota and Chris are definitely dating,\" one source said. \"They've gotten to know each other really well and are very comfortable from one another. Chris sends Dakota his music to get her opinion. It's more than just a fling.\"\nA sighting at Nick Cave's concert in Israel solidified this news. Afterwards, they had dinner at Yam Sheva restaurant in Herzliya. \"They came in and they were really, really nice, like extremely nice. It was a surprise,\" an eyewitness told the outlet. \"They sat with Nick Cave too. I didn't see them kiss or hold hands or anything like that. They ordered some starters and not a lot of food.\"\nPeople obtained photos of Johnson and Martin at Soho House in Malibu, California. An eyewitness said, \"Chris and Dakota arrived together in Chris' car. They met up with friends and had a fun night. They both seemed very happy. They were flirty, and also left the restaurant together.\"\nA week later, People spotted the couple walking the beach in Malibu, with a source noting that they had spent \"m0st of the weekend together.\" The insider offered that, \"They seem to be getting more serious. On Friday, they had dinner with friends. They also hung out at Chris' house and went for a beach walk. They didn't see each other over the holidays and seem excited to be catching up now.\"  \nPeople was reportedly on their date night scene again at Stella McCartney's autumn collection unveiling. They skipped the red carpet, but an onlooker said the couple stayed close once inside the event. \"They walked in holding hands and Dakota was not letting go—she was super into the PDA,\" the eyewitness remembered. \"When Chris let go of her hand, she slipped her arm through his.\" \nLater that month, Dakota's father, Don Johnson seemingly confirmed her relationship to Digital Spy. When asked about his daughter's romance he said, \"Yeah, that's... uh troubling, isn't it? No, she's a big girl, she can handle herself!\"\nIn mid-February, the couple appeared at Ellen  DeGeneres' 60th birthday party, an event also attended by Paltrow and her fiancé Brad Falchuk. People obtained photos of the pair holding hands outside of the festivities while talking to Drew Barrymore.\nA few months later, the pair was spotted walking Johnson's dog, Zeppelin around Malibu. People spoke to a source who gave insight into Johnson and Martin's relationship. \"For the past two weeks, they have spent a lot of time together,\" the insider said. \"Chris lives in Malibu and Dakota seems to love hanging out there. They occasionally go for dinner with friends, but mostly have friends over at home. They go to the beach together, and walks around the neighborhood. They seem to enjoy sharing a quiet life. It does seem they are getting more serious.\"\nThe following month, a Twitter user caught the couple at a Radiohead concert in Boston. They were seemingly on a double date with Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul and his wife, Lauren. \"They stood up for a couple of the ovations,\" a concertgoer told People, noting that they sat for most of the show. Earlier, Martin and Johnson were seen strolling into the venue hand in hand.\nHI IM SAT BEHIND CHRIS MARTIN AND DOKOTA JOHNSON pic.twitter.com/YcDGFRpvqP\nThe weekend of Paltrow's wedding to Falchuk, Martin supported Johnson at the Global Citizen Festival in New York City. E! noted Martin's presence in the audience while Johnson spoke onstage about the power of sharing stories of sexual assault.\nAs further proof of the pair's bond, they seemingly got matching tattoos. E! spotted the similar ink when Johnson was photographed at the Venice Film Festival. On her left elbow, there was an infinity sign tattoo with two Xs. Days prior, Martin was seen at an event in Los Angeles with the same tattoo in a similar location.\nA week later, TMZ reported that Martin and Johnson were throwing a gender reveal party at his home. Photos of blue and pink balloon arches raised speculation that the couple could be expecting a baby. Both of Johnson's parents, including mother Melanie Griffith, and celebrities such as Sean Penn and Julia Roberts were spotted at the event.\nShortly after, Johnson's rep denied the rumors to Us Weekly, clarifying that the celebrations were for a birthday party and not a gender reveal of any kind. On Ellen the following month Johnson confirmed that sentiment herself, saying, \"Well, the only thing I'm pregnant with is a lot of really good ideas. But not any babies.\"\nAround a year after Martin and Johnson were first spotted at Sushi Park, the couple returned for a casual dinner out. A source told Us Weekly around this time that the couple will \"be engaged soon. Chris is head over heels.\" The insider also claimed that Martin was holding off on an engagement after Paltrow wed Falchuk in September. \"He wanted to make sure the kids didn't have too much change all at once,\" the source said. \"He's a great dad.\" \nMartin spent Thanksgiving with Paltrow and their two children, Apple, 15 and Moses, 13. A source told E!, \"Gwyneth thinks (Johnson) is lovely. She gets on very well with her and is happy for Chris. They've spent a good amount of time together and have a very nice friendship.\" \nJohnson and Martin were photographed walking her dog barefoot around Malibu in their last public sighting for months.\nThe Sun reported that the couple split the month prior, to the surprise of close friends. \"Chris and Dakota were very easygoing and always seemed really happy together,\" a source told the outlet. Meanwhile, The Express claimed that Johnson and Martin \"could not have been further apart\" when it came to starting a family. A source said, \"Chris made it clear he wants more kids as soon as possible but Dakota's career has really taken off and that's the last thing she wanted to think about right away. It got to the point, last month, where a light seemed to flick on in both their heads and they realized they were pulling in completely opposite directions - so they decided to call it a day.\"\nRumors of reconciliation begin when a Twitter user spotted Johnson and Martin at a wrap party for the actress's upcoming movie, Covers.\nAnother New Picture of Dakota and Chris Martin at the wrap-party of #Covers last night ♥ #DakotaJohnson; via tyraoneal_ on Instagram. pic.twitter.com/qMH7fghtfI\nSoon after the sighting, Us Weekly confirmed that the pair had reunited. The day after their initial spotting, Martin attended the Los Angeles premiere of Johnson's new movie, The Peanut Butter Falcon. E! also shared that the couple was back together and \"planning to spend more time together later this summer,\" per a source\nUs Weekly reported that the couple's reconciliation came courtesy of Martin's ex, Paltrow. \"Gwyneth is the one who pushed them to do it,\" a source said, noting that the two had bonded at an April event.\nThere could be some truth to that claim, as Martin, Paltrow, and their respective partners were all spotted in the Hamptons together in photos from TMZ. Shortly after, Johnson and Martin had date night at East Village's Double Zero in NYC. \nGriffith, Johnson's mother, definitively commented on her daughter's relationship with Martin. \"I love my daughter’s boyfriend. I think that they're an awesome couple,\" she told People. A source told an outlet at the time that privacy is paramount for the couple. \"Dakota has been filming out of state, but most weekends she comes back to Malibu to spend time with Chris,\" the insider said. \"They are very low-key together. They usually have friends over and rarely go out.\" \nOn October 4, it wasn't Martin wishing Johnson a happy birthday on social media. It was his ex Paltrow, who shared a black-and-white photo of Johnson and her pet dog. \"Happy 30th birthday to this absolute gem 💙,\" she captioned the celebratory IG post.\nA few days later, E! reported on Johnson's 30th birthday bash in Malibu. Guests included Martin, Paltrow, and celebs such as Miley Cyrus and Robert Downey Jr. The report said Johnson and Martin arrived at the event together and spent most of the evening by each other's side. \"Dakota and Chris sat side by side watching different musical acts,\" the source told E!. \"Dakota and Chris spent a lot of time together. They walked around holding hands or with his hand on her back. They seemed very happy.\" \nJust before Christmas, Page Six spotted Johnson on a trip to Aspen with Martin, Paltrow, and the former couple's two children Apple and Moses. In photos, Johnson locked arms with Apple while on a coffee run alongside Martin. On Christmas day, Paltrow shared an Instagram of herself and husband Falchuk in ski gear, indicating he was also on the family trip.\nPaltrow's support of her ex-husband's relationship continued into the new year. In a cover story interview with Harper's Bazaar, she had nothing but kind words for Johnson. \"I love her,\" Paltrow said. \"I can see how it would seem weird because it’s sort of unconventional. But I think, in this case, just having passed through it iteratively, I just adore her. I always start to think of the ampersand sign—what else can you bring in, instead of being resistant to or being made insecure by? There’s so much juice in leaning in to something like that.”\nShe also spoke about the evolving nature of her dynamic with Martin. \"It’s not like there’s a finish line: ‘Oh, we consciously uncoupled; we’re done,'\" she explained. \"It’s a lifelong commitment to constantly reinvent your relationship with your ex, which you do presumably because you have children together. I don’t see a reason to do it if you don’t have children together. Some people do. But I think we put all the hard work in at the beginning. I would say very rarely is it difficult now. We’ve learned how to communicate with each other. We love each other. We laugh. We have the best of each other. It’s really nice. It makes you feel like you don’t have to lose.”\nMartin was involved in a major career milestone for Johnson. On Valentine's Day, Coldplay released its music video f0r the song, “Cry Cry Cry.” The romantic video's director was none other than Johnson, who made her directorial debut with the collaboration.\nEarly this month, the couple had a rare public outing with Martin's two children. The foursome was spotted by the Daily Mail strolling through Disneyland for his 43rd birthday. \nA few weeks later, Martin and Johnson enjoyed dinner at Crossroads Kitchen in Los Angeles, per E!. Johnson wore dark wide leg jeans, a hoodie, and black loafers for the outing. Meanwhile, Martin sported a long sleeve shirt, dark gray pants, and a blue baseball cap. During an interview with Architectural Digest a few days prior, Johnson had joked that \"the key to a healthy relationship\" with Martin is having \"double sinks\" in the bathroom. \nQuarantine hasn't stopped the couple from sharing some adorable moments together. On March 26, Johnson's friend Olivia Wilde posted a video made by the pair with the caption, “Dakota Johnson: Hand wash CHAMPION.” In the clip, Johnson stands in front of a kitchen sink as she demonstrates her hand washing technique. It's soon clear that the actress's \"hands\" in the video were Martin's. The \"M\" and \"A\" tattoos on each of the wrists gave it away. Martin scrubbed his hands while Johnson spoke to the camera.   \nA few days later, Martin and Johnson made a rare public appearance together while on a break from quarantine. Photographers snapped the couple walking arm-in-arm through Malibu with Johnson's dog on March 31. \nPeople reported that Johnson and Martin are still going strong and are still spending time with Martin's kids his ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, and her husband, Brad Flachuck. The two are living in the $12.5 million Malibu mansion Martin bought last October. \n\"Chris was always a big fan of Malibu,\" a source told People. \"He loves the beach and often goes surfing and running. The source added: \"She seems to enjoy it as much as Chris does. They both love the outdoors and often take beach strolls. They also support local restaurants.\"\nPer The Daily Mail, Johnson has been fueling rumors of her engagement to Martin—with an Emerald ring on her left finger. Neither Johnson nor Martin have confirmed the rumor. \nOn Saturday the 24th, Martin and Johnson were seen out in Malibu for a lunch and coffee date, while fans still wonder if the two are planning to tie the knot. Johnson wore ripped jeans, a black spaghetti-strap top, black Adidas sneakers, and a green knit hat as Martin, who was barefoot, in gray sweats, and a black shirt, followed. \nMartin and Johnson were spotted enjoying a vacation in Palma De Mallorca, Spain, where they took a boat ride and were seen taking a leisurely stroll together. They each wore black baseball caps as they joined arms. \nEarlier in the month, Martin and Johnson were photographed together in New York City. They walked arm in arm, wearing matching pink and black outfits. A few weeks later, the couple was seen in London, where they grabbed dinner in the chic neighborhood of Mayfair. Johnson wore a coat over a white button down and black pants, along with a pair of Converses and a Gucci purse. Martin opted for a low-key black sweater, gray sweatpants, and knit beanie.\nColdplay announced it would be postponing several shows in Brazil due to Martin coming down with a serious lung infection. Later that month, he and Johnson were spotted on a beachside stroll in their home city of Malibu. Johnson wore a white sweatshirt and gray sweatpants, while Martin paired a graphic tee with a baseball cap and baggy pants.\nJohnson put on her own show in the audience at Martin's November 8 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Johnson told Vanity Fair in July 2022 that she loves to tour with Coldplay when she's not working, and she apparently also loves dancing up a storm to her man's tunes.\nAmo como disfrutó el concierto 😍❤️ #dakotajhonson #DakotaJohnson pic.twitter.com/ZzqtvnQiLi\nWhen Johnson can't travel with him, Martin makes a point of visiting her. He stopped by Boston, Massachusetts, to see his girlfriend as she was filming the superhero movie Madame Web that summer.\nOn the March 19 episode of the Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast, Martin shared how Johnson made Coldplay reconsider accessibility at their shows by introducing him to new tactile technology.\n“They are called SubPacs,” he explained. “Dakota, my partner, gave me one as a gift because she saw someone online experiencing whatever they are experiencing with this—it's kind of like body armor —you put it on and plug it in and it connects to the base.”\nJohnson had seen the technology being used online and told Martin that he “should use this somehow.”\n“So, we started using it and it's been so amazing and it should get better and better,” Martin continued. “We have ten or twenty now—every night—of those packs and so if you're hearing impaired we have an area where you sign up and you put on the pack and you can feel the show.”\nHe added that the SubPacs are expensive, but well-worth it because “they are amazing and the things that people do to consider other people are just wonderful.”\nOn Saturday of Easter weekend, Johnson and Martin were seen in Malibu, California, going on a coffee run together. During the rare public outing, Johnson wore large sunglasses, a black hat, a pair of floral tapestry loose pants by Bode, Converse sneakers, and a Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. \nMartin wore a light grey t-shirt, matching sweatpants, and sneakers with a grey beanie. Johnson had her arm looped through Martin's as they walked together. \nOn June 21, Chris Martin and his band Coldplay were performing in Naples, Italy, and his girlfriend Dakota Johnson was in the audience. In a video shared by the Daily Mail, the singer covered the stage, then stopped to serenade her where she was sitting to watch the show in the sound deck. Johnson smiled and blew him a kiss.\nJohnson kicked off the month by being a supportive girlfriend. The actress attended Martin’s Coldplay concert on Sunday, October 1, in Pasadena, California, with her mother. Photos came out of Johnson there in a long leather jacket with a black top and light pants.\nHilary Weaver is a freelance writer based in New York who writes about politics, queer issues, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and every woman the Queen has ever made a dame.

{"title": "Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-02 21:14:00", "text": "Earlier this year, it was rumored that model Kendall Jenner and musical artist Bad Bunny were starting a romantic relationship, and a few months later things seem to still be going strong. Jenner split with her on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend Devin Booker in 2022, and was reportedly spending time enjoying the single life.\nThen Bad Bunny, or Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, swept her off her feet. Here's their relationship timeline so far.\nThe pair were first seen together out for a date in Beverly Hills. Jenner and Ocasio were spotted leaving Wally's, a popular eatery amongst the rich and famous. E! News said that Hailey and Justin Bieber were also at the restaurant, which could mean they were on a double date — or everyone wanted brunch at the same time.\nThe new couple were out in West Hollywood in early March having dinner with friends. They shared a hug and possibly a kiss before parting. By he end of the month, the rapper seemed to be mentioning his new gal friend on Eladio Carrión's track “Coco Chanel.” \nIn the lyrics, he sings, “I’m not bad, baby that’s a gimmick / But the sun in Puerto Rico is hotter than in Phoenix / She knows it.”\nBooker, Jenner's ex, plays for the Phoenix Suns. Elsewhere on the song, he shouts out “Scorpio women,” which is Jenner's birth sign. A source told US Weekly that month that Jenner wasn’t “really looking to date anybody.”\n“Things are not official between Kendall and Bad Bunny, but they’re seeing each other on a regular basis and getting to know each other better,” the insider said, but Jenner's feelings were “starting to grow” after “spending more time” with him.\n“It’s not super serious, but she likes him and is open to seeing where things go with him. Kendall appreciates how he treats her with respect and he makes her laugh,” the insider added. “He’s very charming and she thinks he’s a great guy. Although things are still fairly new, she definitely sees potential.” \nIn late March, they were seen out at dinner again and an eyewitness said they were “openly kissing” and “being very affectionate.” \nIn April, TMZ reported the couple had gone horseback riding together, so things have definitely heated up. On April 15, Jenner watched Bad Bunny's performance at Coachella in Indio, California, and was captured dancing on the crowd on a TikTok. Later that weekend she was also photographed by his side as he whispered to her in the crowd. \nThey were then seen together at Tyler the Creator's concert in Los Angeles on Wednesday, April 26, dressed casually and laughing as they walked through the street.\nOn Saturday, April 29, they were seen in NYC heading to Carbone, a celebrity favorite. They later headed to Pergola for after-dinner drinks, leaving together in a blue Mercedes. For the night out, Jenner stunned in a sleeveless semi-sheer asymmetrical crop top that matched her dark brown miniskirt trimmed in tan fuzz. She completed the look with knee high leather boots covered in belt details.\nThe rapper wore black slacks with a black and yellow leather jacket and a pair of black sunglasses. He had one square-toed black boots and a gold chain around his neck.\nJenner and Bunny didn't walk the Met Gala red carpet, but they attended an after-party together.\nA source told People that same day that the couple was becoming “more serious.”\n“They are very cute together. Kendall is happy,” the source said. “He is a fun guy. Very much a gentleman and charming. She likes his vibe. He is very chill.”\n“It was a slow start, but they spend almost every day together now,” the source continued. “He hangs out with her friends and she hangs out with his. It's more of a relationship now. Kendall is not seeing anyone else. She really likes him.”\nOn May 11, E! reported that Bunny and Jenner went on vacation together with friends. A TikTok revealed this, with Bunny and Jenner appearing alongside each other in a video taken by photographer Renell Medrano and posted to his page. He ultimately took it down. A screenshot from the video of Bunny and Jenner remains online here.\nAnother source told UsWeekly that day, “Things are going really well for Kendall and Bad Bunny and she definitely sees long-term potential with him. She feels like he’s the complete package and he treats her like a total gentleman.”\nThey added that she is “really attracted” to the artist’s confidence. \n“They are having a great time together, and she appreciates that he gets along with all of her friends,” the source said. “They complement each other on so many levels and she’s enjoying getting to know him better every day.”\nOn May 12, they were seen sitting court side at the Lakers playoff game in Los Angeles.\nOn May 24, a source gave more detail to Entertainment Tonight about how Jenner and Bunny's more serious relationship was progressing. “He is not only spending more time with Kendall, but with the rest of the family as well,” the source said.\nThere's “potential” for the pair's romance to be more “long term,” the source added. “They’re both always laughing and smiling together and have similar family values.” Jenner herself is “enjoying their low-key relationship and is excited about where they're headed.”\nOn June 21, interviews with both Jenner and Bunny came out where they discussed their intention to keep their relationship private.\nBunny told Rolling Stone of keeping his personal life under the wraps, “I know something is going to come out. I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what’s left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.” \nWhen asked if he wanted to clear up any rumors about his relationship with Jenner, he repeated that line: “That’s the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.”\nJenner told WSJ magazine, meanwhile, that she had  “no comment” on Bunny.\n“I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side,” she explained. “Does that make sense? I’ll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that’s the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.” \nA source told People that Jenner and Bunny went on vacation together to Gozzer Ranch Golf & Lake Club in Harrison, Idaho.\nThe source described them as “really cute” and “so happy together,” adding, “They definitely seem in love, and super serious. They're really friendly. Kendall is so low key that plenty of guests don't even know who she was.”\nJenner and Bad Bunny were also seen back in West Hollywood on July 27, enjoying a dinner date together at Sushi Park. It's one of their favorite spots, and they were also seen there with friends in late June.\nThat same day, on an episode of The Kardashians, Jenner shared that her mom Kris has gifted custom dollhouses to all her siblings for Christmas and decorated her to manifest a marriage.\n“She put an engagement ring in mine, because she thought it was manifesting an engagement for me,” she said in a confessional. “So if that tells you anything about where my mom wants me to be in life.”\nVideos and photos of Jenner and Bunny kissing and showing PDA came out when the couple attended Drake's Los Angeles concert together. The date night marked one of their most affectionate public outings yet since they started seeing each other.\nLater in August, Bunny appeared to soft launch their relationship on his Instagram Stories. He shared a video featuring a woman he called “mami” whose voice resembled Jenner’s. He also wore a “K” initial necklace in one photo and had a photo of her 818 tequila line in another.\nKendall on Benito’s insta story 🥰 pic.twitter.com/21odRhMWnm\nThroughout the month, Jenner and Bunny had a string of public dates, including at the Met Opera in New York City and at Gucci’s fashion show in Milan.\nBunny also addressed why he is so against discussing his romance with Jenner in a Vanity Fair profile published in mid-September.\nRegarding fans who disapprove of him dating Jenner, he said, “they don’t know how you feel, they don’t know how you live, they don’t know anything, and I really don’t want them to know. I’m not really interested in clarifying anything because I have no commitment to clarify anything to anyone. I am clear and my friend Jomar [Dávila] is clear and my mother is clear. They are the only ones to whom I have to clarify anything. As for Juliana Dominguez from Mississippi [a random fan name], I have nothing I need to clarify to her. Never. About anything.”\n“There are people who say that artists have to put up with it,” he continued. “I don’t have to accept anything and everything because I wanted to be an artist. At the end of the day, you listen to me because you want to. I don’t force you to.”\nHe also revealed that he isn’t about to get engaged to anyone. When asked if he wanted traditional milestones like a wedding and kids, he said, “no, I don’t think so,” adding at least “not now.”  \nAfter shortly after their appearance at Gucci’s show, Jenner and Bunny appeared in the fashion house’s newest campaign together, released on September 30.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "All About Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen’s Rumored Relationship", "date": "2023-10-02 21:33:00", "text": "Romance rumors have been swirling around actress Hailee Steinfeld and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen since spring 2023. They were first spotted on Thursday, May 25, then again that Saturday. The pair were spotted that night getting out of a black SUV before enjoying their evening together.\nThey also had dinner at Sushi by Bou, with photos of them at the restaurant posted on Facebook by the sushi spot's founder, Michael Sinensky.\nIn the months since, they’ve continued to spark dating rumors. Here’s everything to know about Steinfeld's rumored romantic interest Josh Allen so far.\nThe football star once played for University of Wyoming, and was selected seventh overall by the Buffalo Bills in the 2018 NFL Draft after his stellar performance as an MVP. The 27-year-old took a couple years to warm up to NFL life, then lived up to his reputation with an incredible 202o season, leading the team to their first division title and playoff victory since 1995.\nAllen's personal life has been a big part of his story, as he had been dating longtime girlfriend Brittany Williams for eight years. \nThey first met as children, and even went to the Sadie Hawkins dance together in high school, but didn't start dating until college. However, they have seemingly split. Fans of the player noted in May that he'd stopped following Williams on social media, though he still has some snapshots of his former girlfriend up on the timeline. Williams has unfollowed and deleted all of her photos with Allen.\nBased on the very recent social media clues and very recent sightings, it likely hasn't been long. Steinfeld was most recently dating Irish musician Niall Horan, starting in early 2018. They broke up less than a year later.\n“They split months ago,” a source told Us Weekly in December of that year. “Niall wrapped up his tour and had more free time, but Hailee’s work schedule really ramped up, so they didn’t have time for a relationship. They still have a lot of love for each other.” \nIn July, over Independence Day weekend, the pair were seen in Los Cabos and photographed smooching in the water. Steinfeld was wearing a bucket hat and sunglasses, and had her arms wrapped around Allen's neck as they kissed. He was also wearing sunglasses and had wet hair from their pool time.\nSteinfeld was photographed shopping with Allen’s mom Lavonne on September 30. The women bought Bills merchandise to support Allen at Leveled Up Buffalo in East Aurora, New York. The shop shared a photo of Lavonne and Steinfeld posing with owner Lindsey Vega on its Instagram.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Can Taylor Lorenz Fix the Internet?", "date": "2023-10-03 12:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe Washington Post reporter breaks the internet on a regular basis. Can she keep it from breaking her?\nOne million years ago, in 2009, the first image had yet to be posted on Instagram, “friend” was just starting its transformation into a verb, and the internet was still, by and large, considered a realm you could enter and leave at will. It was also the Great Recession, and jobs were scarce. Which is how Taylor Lorenz, then in her twenties, signed up with a temporary work agency and found gigs doing the types of administrative tasks that stretch time out like taffy. Until one day when her cubicle mate showed her a portal. “Oh, I just go on Tumblr all day,” the woman said. \nLorenz spent the rest of the afternoon scrolling and exploring the blogging platform, which teemed with the open, hopeful energy of a new world. Then she went home, logged back in, and kept going. After years of never finding where she fit in, Tumblr introduced her to a space where she felt, finally, at home: the internet. \nNow, the Washington Post reporter, whose first book, Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet, is out today, is one of the most extremely online (per her title) reporters in the country, and one of the most discussed. \nAt The Daily Beast, The Atlantic, the New York Times, and now the Post, she has pioneered, legitimized, and dominated a beat sometimes described as “internet culture.” Thanks to her, people who get their news from newspapers understand “ok boomer” is an insult and are familiar with the adjective cheugy. The same goes for the conspiracy parody group Birds Aren’t Real, the 14-year-old creator who originated the TikTok dance known as the Renegade, and the formerly anonymous right-wing influencer account Libs of TikTok.   \nLorenz remains immersed in the world she covers: She has over half a million followers on TikTok and over 346,000 on Twitter, recently rebranded as X. (We’ve continued to refer to it as Twitter here for clarity.) And while Lorenz doesn’t monetize her content, she navigates social media like a lot of people who do, in that she’s attuned to engagement, undeterred by conflict, and plainly interested in brand-building. On TikTok, she offers tips for early-career journalists and slaps back at nasty comments. On Twitter, she posts, reposts, argues, replies, opines, signal boosts, subtweets, and sometimes even apologizes at a steady clip. \nSomewhere along the way, though, Lorenz has become not just a journalist, but a phenomenon. Tucker Carlson, in one of his numerous Lorenz-focused segments, described her as being “at the very top of journalism’s repulsive little food chain.” She is the terrain upon which people fight battles about the perils of social media and journalism, about misogyny and trolls, as well as someone who has been ingested by the attention economy and refracted back as a million pieces that float around the internet, alternately true and totally twisted. She is 24, she’s 50, she has a trust fund, she is a talented reporter, she has ties to the Clintons, she is a lizard (yes, a lizard). She is, in other words, not just synonymous with her beat but representative of it. As she has put it, she has lost the narrative of her own life.\nThe toxicity of online spaces, though, has not led Lorenz to disengage (she did take a five-month break from Twitter while working on her book but said it led her reporting to suffer). Last May, as a new set of claims led her to go viral on Twitter for the umpteenth time, she could be found riding the wave. “Go ahead and drop all the conspiracies about me you want, it only adds to my lore,” she tweeted.\nWhen I meet Lorenz in person, I learn not all the lore is false. She is vegan and often keeps the thermostat in her home at 87 degrees: “My body temperature’s very low,” she says on a recent morning in Washington Square Park in New York, where she’s visiting for work. “I always joke that I am part lizard, so the lizard conspiracy is very apt.” She moved from her 400-square-foot Brooklyn apartment to East Los Angeles during the summer of 2020, looking for more space in which to quarantine. Most mornings, she makes fresh nectar for her hummingbird feeders and watches the birds. Most nights, she watches a horror movie—she once read they can help people externalize anxiety and thought that made sense.\nBut despite Lorenz’s frequently stated belief that there is no distinction between being online and offline—“the internet is the world,” she tells me—the person I anticipated from her social media is different from the one I meet. Online, it’s not uncommon to find Lorenz, who’s immunocompromised, writing posts like this: “It’s wild how quickly a certain brand of leftist went from ‘healthcare is a human right!!!’ to ‘disabled people should shut up and die already and stop asking for basic COVID protections bc I am fine with normalizing mass death/disability as long as it doesn’t disrupt my brunch.’ ” In person, though, she is apologetic even asking if we can move when someone nearby begins coughing. (Navigating COVID as a high-risk person, she says, sometimes leaves her feeling like she’s in a zombie movie.) “I don’t think I’m the type of person who’s militant about anything,” she says, adding that the night before, she hung out with an old friend who loves Carlson so much she calls him her boyfriend. \nLorenz is also “very open to many points of view,” impulsive (“which is not a good quality,” she says), and by turns kind and combative, confident and self-effacing. “It’s funny when people paint her as controversial,” says her friend Kat Tenbarge, a tech and culture reporter at NBC News. “I’m like, ‘Not in real life.’ ” Lindsey Underwood, an editor at the Washington Post, describes her as “a regular-ass girl” who is notably generous—when Underwood was moving to L.A., Lorenz checked out a prospective home for her. “How she’s seen online is perplexing,” says Cooper Fleishman, who edited some early pieces of Lorenz’s at the online news site Mic. “She welcomes [disagreement] and throws herself in there. But the backlash is so far out of proportion to what she’s actually saying that it feels like, Is this a thing? Or is the right turning her into a caricature? And are we playing into that?” \nPart of what inflames matters is that Lorenz sometimes, for example, calls out public figures for problematic tweets they made as teenagers, while auto-deleting her own tweets, putting her in the middle of hot-button debates around cancel culture, hypocrisy, and language. (“I think having a long history of everything you’ve ever said on the internet is insane, actually,” she says.) Some who have interacted with Lorenz on Twitter question if she engages with others in ways that increase the platform’s toxicity. One person who worked on a piece about long COVID that Lorenz harshly criticized says, “It comes back to a super interesting thing: Her career is about how the internet breaks people’s brains, and her beat involves understanding why a certain kind of discourse is problematic. Yet she sometimes acts in ways that are very antagonistic and not productive.” \nIt’s hardly unusual to find acrimonious debates online. What remains surprising is that Lorenz, whom her former boss Neetzan Zimmerman (who has himself been called a viral news genius) describes as smarter about the internet than anyone he’s ever met, can seem so taken aback by how she’s perceived. “What have I ever done that’s controversial?” she says to me at one point. I suggest her COVID views might be seen that way. “I don’t know,” she says, then proceeds to list views that are indeed not that controversial, but also not what I, at least, expected from her posts. “I think the majority of people would want investments in vaccines,” she says. “We desperately need clean air standards for buildings. Paid sick leave. By the way, people should have accessible health care. I guess that’s controversial, but truly, are you kidding me?” \nHow much should a journalist be judged by what they do on social media anyway? Lorenz has often been at the center of this debate both because her Twitter presence sometimes overshadows her journalism and because her critics use any missteps she makes there to undermine her legitimacy. Which Lorenz finds absurd. “It’s like I’m living in a crazy land,” Lorenz says. “The internet is the world. What if you’re at a dinner party and somebody says, ‘Oh, x y z,’ and somebody else says ‘That’s not right,’ and you say ‘Oh, my bad.’ So you should never be a journalist again?”\nEven a few years ago, Lorenz was able to move easily through the internet. She sold furniture on Instagram Stories and used Twitter to recommend her newly available apartment to potential renters. In recent years, though, beneath just about every YouTube video featuring her there are dozens, if not hundreds, of comments criticizing her, often in very personal terms. Lorenz has also described being barraged with hateful messages, including rape and death threats, via every channel through which she can be reached—her cell phone, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter DM. She says she has been doxxed and experienced a swatting attempt, has had law enforcement sent to the homes of family members, and has been a target of stalking. \nIn 2022, Lorenz spoke to MSNBC for a segment about online harassment in which she talked about having PTSD. Screenshots from a moment when Lorenz briefly broke down in tears were later used to mock and shame her. Lorenz remains very critical of the segment. “If you have [an under-three-minute] segment, there’s no way you can provide the proper context so that image won’t immediately be screenshot and used for harassment,” she says in our interview. “I cannot wait for cable news to rot in hell.” She has said in the past that certain types of media coverage have caused more harm to her than anything else.\nJust two weeks after the MSNBC story ran, Lorenz published a piece revealing the name of the person behind Libs of TikTok. The backlash was enormous. (The right-wing site The Daily Wire put up a massive billboard in Times Square that read, “Taylor Lorenz Doxxed @LibsofTikTok.”) “I’ve dealt with reporters who have been in war zones and have also taken online harassment, and to be perfectly honest, when they’re in distress and talking to me, I hear the same tone in their voice,” says Mark Seibel, Lorenz’s editor at the Post.\nAs a result, she no longer shares certain details of her life, because they make her easier to find—her age, for example. (Plus, “it’s irrelevant,” she says.) She doesn’t share her dating status. In terms of her family, all she’ll say is that she grew up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. “Every little piece of information you give, it’s going to sprout five more pieces of misinformation,” she says. “You want to be like, ‘You’re wrong.’ But it’s fruitless. The truth doesn’t matter.” She doesn’t believe all criticism of her is unfair—“I’ve made so many mistakes on the internet over the years,” she says. What she takes issue with are discussions of her personal life unrelated to her work.\nShe will speak about aspects of her background that haven’t become conspiracy fodder. As a young person, Lorenz felt alienated; as soon as she was old enough, she began escaping to the city. “I’m very dyslexic, and school was always a really hard time,” she says. She didn’t seek community online, though. Instead, she worked. \nBy age 14, she had already been employed as a mother’s helper and a gift wrapper, and had volunteered as a candy striper at Greenwich Hospital, delivering mail and busing dishes in the cafe. During college, she sold replacement windows door-to-door; after graduation, she worked as an administrative assistant and, at one point, at a call center for Vineyard Vines. Then she started temping and found Tumblr. Soon she’d started dozens of blogs on the platform. One of the more popular focused on sprinkles; another was about bagels. The thrill was seeing how big she could get them to be, and soon some had thousands of followers, giving her an early taste of virality. While it wasn’t clear yet how she’d make this her life, she knew she wanted to. \nIn 2012, she was hired by an ad agency to handle social media for brands; she ran Verizon’s Facebook page and helped with Bud Light’s. A year later, she noticed the Daily Mail—“literally my favorite website”—didn’t have a Facebook page. She was soon handling their social media globally. Around then, she started freelance writing stories about the newly emerging world of online virality and fame. “She began to realize it wasn’t just language shifting and culture shifting, it was power,” Fleishman says. “That’s what Taylor spearheaded in journalism—looking at internet culture as a nexus of power.” \nEven before she was well known as a reporter, Lorenz showed up in the news. While living in Baltimore in 2015, she witnessed a fatal stabbing: “Blood just started erupting out of his chest,” Lorenz told the Baltimore Sun. In early 2016, she was riding an Amtrak train hit by an unknown object. “There was this great boom,” she told CBS afterward. \n“My mom says I’m like Forrest Gump,” she says now. “If there’s something going on, I’m running toward it.” As the then director for emerging platforms for the political website The Hill, Lorenz was live streaming the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville when James Alex Fields Jr. drove his Dodge Challenger into the crowd, killing Heather Heyer. (Her footage ended up in Spike Lee’s film BlacKkKlansman.) Not long after, she decided to try to be a full-time reporter—her beat and the country’s narrative seemed to be folding in on each other. “The far right has always embraced this media ecosystem, so when Trump was elected, all these YouTubers and people that I knew from the influencer world were suddenly relevant,” she says. \nLorenz took a huge pay cut to take a job at The Daily Beast as a tech and culture reporter. She was there for only seven months before moving to The Atlantic, then was poached by the Times a year and a half later. By the time she moved to the Washington Post in 2022, she was such a big name that her job change was the subject of extensive media speculation, especially because it had previously been reported that Times editors had discussed how to deal with the turmoil created by her social media presence (she also occasionally sparred with colleagues on Twitter, including on her way out the door).\nLeaving for the Post had nothing to do with internal issues, Lorenz maintains. “I wanted a raise, and I wanted more autonomy,” she says. “I think the Times needs to get it together in terms of dealing with these online harassment campaigns, but I also think they’re trying.” She recognizes, like anyone familiar with online dynamics, that criticism isn’t always bad for her career. “The irony of what Tucker did is he put me on this new level, which is beneficial in the sense that it raises your profile,” she says. “Notoriety is helpful.” Similarly, she knows her willingness to be so active on social media, and sometimes polarizing, helped her build a brand large enough to be untethered from her employer—she doesn’t list the legacy media outlet where she works in her bio on Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter. “The brand discourse always triggers people, because we are all pressured to commodify ourselves and that is horrible,” she says. “I don’t like that part of it. But at the same time, it is also what gave me a career.” \nAt this point, though, she’d rather be known for her journalism. “Every time I’m in the media for something, it’s like, ‘Let’s have this big public discussion about whether Taylor is good or bad,’” she says. “This verdict is issued on you, and I hate that. Because most of the time it’s, ‘Fuck this girl.’” Which has contributed to her anxiety ahead of the book’s release: “I’ve been spiraling,” she says. “I feel like it’s going to be this verdict on me. And I just want people to care about my work.” \nLorenz’s ability to note the shifting tides of the online world (and translate their importance) has led her to sometimes be treated like a kind of internet clairvoyant. Extremely Online, however, looks backward as opposed to forward, offering a history of social media that covers the rise of the influencer economy. It also features the experiences of several women whose success has been both enabled and complicated by the contradictory, sometimes breathtakingly cruel incentives of social media and the attendant media coverage.  (As is the case with all her journalism, Lorenz doesn’t write in the first person. But it can almost feel like an oversight that her own story is not included.) \n“It helped me process a lot,” Lorenz says. “I was just writing as therapy. A lot of us have gone through this evolution with the internet of having this unbridled positivity about what it can offer, and then being met with the horrible downsides and having to come to terms with that.” But while Extremely Online documents some of the darker sides of the internet, it is not pessimistic. By showing how users, particularly “creators,” have consistently shaped platforms, it ends up as an argument for the users’ agency to shape the internet for the better.\nLorenz has no desire to leave journalism. She prefaces any talk of a career change (maybe she’d be an interior designer or a political consultant) by noting that would only happen if she needed to retire. “I love media, and the minute that I found Tumblr, I loved the internet,” she says.\nShe still does, in fact. “Yes, because anything is possible [online],” she says. “Which is bad, obviously—we know the bad sides. But I don’t think we’re 100 percent in the bad yet. It’s bad. It’s really bad. No, no, no, it’s really bad, but it could be a lot better, I think. I think it could be better if people just understood what’s happening.”\nOn July 5, the same day Instagram’s Twitter competitor Threads became available, Lorenz made herself an account. “What’s up babies,” she posted.\nA version of this story appears in the October 2023 issue of ELLE.\nGET THE LATEST ISSUE OF ELLE\nMolly Langmuir is a freelance writer and former staff writer for ELLE. \nMeet Ella Richards and Lucie de la Falaise\nCesar Chávez’s Granddaughter on the Biden Campaign\nPhoebe Dynevor Is in Her Fearless Era\nFall Is All About the Big Bag Theory\nRaul Lopez Is Doing It for the Culture\nBishme Cromartie’s Victory Means Something More\nHow Khaite Captured the Cool-Girl Crowd\nThe 1950s Are Back, at Least on the Runway\nMy So-Called #TradWife Life\nFashion Has a Case of Main Character Syndrome\nZendaya Holds Court\n‘Nobody Can Take Your Power’\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "12 Ballet Flats With Real Arch Support, According to an Expert Who’s ‘En Pointe’", "date": "2023-10-03 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nWear this season’s most popular styles in complete comfort.\nAll of my prima ballerinas out there know too well that those pink satin dancing shoes fall far from the realm of comfort. Consequentially, their watered-down, functional fashion counterpart, the ballet flat, doesn’t exactly provide much in the way of relief or reinforcement, either. So while the concept of ballet flats with arch support may seem contradictory, rest assured that you can still wear one of this season’s hottest fall shoe trends without totally compromising comfort.\nAnd who better to pirouette-turn to than Dr. Ann Anderson, podiatrist and podiatric surgeon with a background in ballet? “A ballet flat will not usually give as much arch support as a sneaker,” she admits. “But [they] can be supportive if the construction of the shoe incorporates an arch support...” Despite the name, a “flat” shoe can still offer adequate support if it’s intentionally designed. \nThankfully, certain brands have mastered the art of comfortable ballet flats. Anderson suggests looking for a heel cup or arch support that is part of the shoe design in order to help support your foot overall. Below, shop the 12 best ballet flats with arch support to wear this season.\nIn all likelihood, you’ve already seen Vivaia flats trending across social media, touting extreme comfort and earth-friendly composition. Complete with an Armisia Argy herbal insole, the Aria 5°  provides promising heel rebound, arch and forefront support, and a padded  heel patch for extra cushy comfort. This style is also machine-washable, making it a champion of convenience as well.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: 31 options\nMaterial: Recycled cardboard, carbon-free rubber\nCustomer review: “Vivaia’s shoes are made from recycled plastic bottles, which is what originally got me interested in the brand. I think we can all agree, 6 plastic bottles never looked this good...the first thing I noticed was the insole; these are now more cushioned and structured around the arches and toes.”\nA style I’m most looking forward to wearing this season, the Mary Jane makes a case for comfort with this square-toed, patent pair of flats from Cole Haan. An easy accomplice for fall denim or cozy sweater dresses, this shoe is lightweight and comes equipped with additional arch support. \nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Black/Gold, Lizard Gold\nMaterial: Synthetic, polyurethane\nCustomer review: “I wanted simple flats that weren’t boring. I wore them for the first time to a wedding. 10 hours, standing at least half of that time, plus dancing, and they were completely comfortable (and I have flat feet).” \nIf you only add one shoe to your closet this year, make it a ruby red slipper. This one from Margaux has a 4.8-star rating from nearly 850 reviews, most of which praise the shoe’s plush, customizable fit and multi-width sizing. And if you need even more support, Anderson suggests adding a custom molded orthotic prescribed by a podiatrist—as over-the-counter options can sometimes be too bulky or thick.\nSizes: 3-14\nColors: 15 options\nMaterial: Nappa leather\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “A problem I have with most flats is that they’re a little too flat. I’ve had more success with Margaux flats than other brands because they have a little cushioning inside.”\nDesigned in nude shades and natural palettes, Rebecca Allen’s patent flat features breathable lining and a foam-cushioned footbed for squishy-soft support. Side note: If you have a wider foot, you may want to size up in these, given the pointed toe.\nSizes: 6-11\nColors: Black, Nude I, Nude II, Nude III, Nude IV\nMaterial: Leather\nCustomer review: “I own two pairs and absolutely love them and get so many compliments! I’ve never had a pair of flats/skims that don’t slip in my heel when walking UNTIL these!”\nA lovechild of the classic ballet flat and timeless loafer, this airy flat comes with a molded EVA insole and a memory foam midsole. It’s also available in multiple widths, so it’s great for those with particularly wide or narrow feet.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Black, Silver Metallic, Beige, Navy\nMaterial: Leather, fabric, synthetic\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “These shoes appealed to me straight away. They’re classic and comfortable. Dressed up or casual, I just love them.”\nNot only do these classic ballerinas add an unexpected pop of pastel to your fall wardrobe, but they also cradle your feet in molded, shock-absorbing EVA foam.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Jade, Natural Beige\nMaterial: Synthetic, microfiber\nCustomer review: “LOVE the jade green color!”\nIf you’re looking to add a little bedazzle and pizzazz to your everyday black-on-black ensemble, these flats from Birdies proudly display a subtle jacquard pattern and bejeweled strap, alongside seven layers of “cloud-like comfort” in the footbed.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: 15 options\nMaterial: Jacquard, rubber\nCustomer review: “Super cute and comfortable flats! Felt a little snug at first, but fit well after wearing around the house for a little bit. Perfect addition to my workwear wardrobe!”\nAnderson lists Vionic as one of her favorite brands when it comes to comfort and support. Vionic prides itself on podiatrist-approved options, no matter the style. So rest assured that this cute, orthotic ballet flat hosts top-tier technology meant to hug your arches and support natural alignment. And if you’re still not sold, this style also received the American Pediatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Navy, Gold, Pewter, Silver, Black\nMaterial: Leather or calf hair, microfiber, rubber\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “These are a dream come true! I have avoided wearing ballet flats for years because they usually lacked arch support. Vionic for the win...now I can wear them with full support for all day comfort!”\nThese charming, feminine flats have a removable PORON®-cushioned insole that focuses on offering maximum arch support. \nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Navy, Camel, Leopard, Black/White\nMaterial: Polyester, leather\nCustomer review: “These are incredibly comfortable. I wore them the first day for 10+ hours and no blisters!”\nThe classic black flat gets a sleek update in the form of this pointed-toe cutout style. Not only can you wear these with practically everything, but you’ll also be relieved to know they’re built with contour and comfort technology, so you can wear them (painlessly) all day long.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Black, Hazelnut, Silver\nMaterial: Synthetic\nWidths: Standard, Wide\nCustomer review: “Cute, dressy flat. Fits true to size, rubs slightly on my heel...but they are great for dressing up an outfit.”\nThese houndstooth slingback flats bring sophisticated details to a classic style—like a side cutout, oversized buckle, and a cushioned footbed with arch support. Perfect for pairing with your favorite sweater and neutral slacks.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Black Houndstooth, Tobacco, Brown, Black\nMaterial: Leather, synthetic, rubber\nCustomer review: “These shoes are beautiful! True to size fit and well made. I had read some reviews that said these shoes run small...this is not my experience. I may get another pair!”\nFitFlop burst onto the footwear scene in 2007 when they introduced biomechanically engineered sandals designed to complement “body structure, joint alignment and natural movement,” while still being non-ugly, of course. A hefty feat indeed, but they’ve overwhelmingly succeeded and expanded their footwear styles to include sneakers, boots, and flats—like this one with almost 300 5-star Amazon reviews.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: 19 options\nMaterial: Leather, fabric, rubber\nCustomer review: “These were perfect...they fit so well they feel like slippers, especially with the subtly padded insole & cushioned outsole...they look like flats but have nice arch support.”\nTypically, actual ballet dancers have notoriously high arches in their feet. But arch support-specific shoes are usually best for lower arch, or flatter, feet. \n“Higher arch feet usually need more cushioning in the shoes for shock absorption than arch support, so I usually do not recommend an arch support shoe for these patients,” Anderson says. Whether your arches are high or low, you should always consult your doctor before ditching all your shoes for orthotics. If your feet are too flat, arch support can cause pesky callouses from excessive pressure along the arch. In this case, it’s best to seek out a custom orthotic that fits your shoes. \n“Ballet can be very hard on your feet,” Anderson notes, due to years of stretching and strengthening the midsole to stand on pointe. But ballet flats in general are “not considered a supportive shoe because they lack significant shoe structure, they have a narrow toe-box, and have no support for the foot,” she states. And a super thin flat with no support can make you feel like your feet are literally pounding the pavement all day long.\nTo counteract this, Anderson advises looking for flats that specifically tout arch support or a heel cup, and a wider toe-box to allow for more wiggle room in the shoes. However, if you do have severe podiatric woes, you may want to wear the style carefully. “I will caution that ballet flats are usually not as deep as other shoes, and this can lead to nail injury due to excessive pressure on the nails,” Anderson warns.\nThe Best Bags to Buy During Amazon’s Big Deals Day\nThe Best Amazon Fashion Deals to Shop Right Now\nShop These Deals on Amazon Shapewear \nThe 49 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon \nKeep These 18 Best Purse Brands on Your Radar Now\nA Hot Girl’s Guide to Amazon Halloween Costumes\n14 Jewelry Deals From Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days\n25 Suede Bags to Carry You Through The Fall Season\nThe Early Black Friday Fashion Sales to Shop Now\nShop Brands That Support Breast Cancer Awareness\nThe Launch: Fashion News to Know This September\n21 Best Lingerie Brands for Women in 2023\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "These Are the 18 Purse Brands to Keep on Your Radar Right Now", "date": "2023-10-03 14:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nYou can never have too many handbags.\nWhether you carry exclusively designer handbags or are a thrift store queen, your purse says a lot about you. Just like any other accessory, it has the potential to be not just a functional piece, but a statement-maker, a conversation starter. With the right bag (and the right contents), you can go anywhere. Gucci, Fendi, and Prada are of course everyone’s dream bags, but what I love about smaller popular purse brands is that they’re typically less ubiquitous. You get the thrill of someone asking, “Where’d you get that bag?” Whoever and wherever you are, that never gets old. \nSome might say you can have too many bags, but the other perk about small purse brands is that they’re typically more affordable than the big designers. So, you can buy however many you want. Step up your purse game—and get into the best fall 2024 bag trends, while you’re at it—and check out these brands, both popular and upcoming, to know right now.\nYou might’ve seen Published By’s sculptural metallic handbags around Instagram, but they’re more than a one-trick brand. Its styles can be worn as statement pieces or as everyday bags, and both ways are bound to garner plenty of compliments.\nPrice range: $350-$1,000\nNon-traditional shoe brand and queer-community favorite SYRO is now venturing into handbags, and you’ll definitely want to get your feet— wait, hands—on this one. Inspired by a trans woman who subdued the Club Q attacker by stomping on him with her heels, this bag is made to be not just a handbag, but protection. Not only is it a uniquely chic bag perfect for clubbing, commuting, and everything in between, but the story behind it makes it totally badass. Get on the pre-order list ASAP!\nPrice range: $375\nMedea is just the kind of subtle, underrated brand that any cool girl needs to have in her stash. The brand’s signature is bags that could pass for shopping bags, but they’re also known to drop must-have new releases like its just-released jeans bag.\nPrice range: €300-€1,100\nIf you saw Bottega Veneta’s latest runway show, you’ll know that the bandana-shaped bag will be the next big shape, but it’s nothing new. Lemaire’s bandana bag is perfect for holding everything you could want while maintaining it’s cool, slouchy shape.\nPrice range: $965-$2,200\nDentro’s bags are great if you want a distressed look without the distressed quality. Spare threads and exposed lining are staples of the brand and make for a uniquely chic look.\nPrice range: $390-$850\nCoach is perhaps one of the penultimate bag brands, but its new line of Coachtopia bags, made with sustainable materials, gives a youthful boost to the brand’s ethos. \nPrice range: $195-$550\nKARA is a great brand for cool statement bags. From oversized chain handles to all-over knots, these designs make for perfect bags to carry on a night out. \nPrice range: $325-$750\nPuppets & Puppets wasn’t always known for their bags, but recent collections have made them a must-have for ironic accessories. You might’ve seen the brand’s popular cookie bags in various colors, but we particularly love its banana handle bag.\nPrice range: $395-$645\nDemellier London makes bags that are sleek and sophisticated, proving you don’t need a designer logo to prove the quality. Made with high-quality sheepskin leather, the styles are smooth, smocked, croc-embossed, or quilted, making for a variety of chic styles that can be worn anywhere.\nPrice range: $450-$695\nW78st uses upcycled materials to make its ultra-cushiony purses, including denim, leather, and special charms. They also come in a range of sizes, from ultra-mini to oversized statement bags.\nPrice range: $420-$570\nYou may know Brahmin as a classic brand for croc-embossed and leather handbags, but the brand’s latest designs and colorways make the brand youthful and fun. They have any color you could possibly want, but if you want to stick to black and brown, they have plenty of chic styles for that, as well.\nPrice range: $95-$435\nKaai’s styles range from mini bags to large leather totes, which means you can get any style you need. With subtle design and minimal logos, these bags make quiet luxury accessible.\nPrice range: $215-$800\nBrandon Blackwood handbags have been popular since they first launched, and there’s a reason. The shapes, colorways, and materials are trendy but high-quality, and the brand name is quickly becoming a designer brand in its own right.\nPrice range: $175-$550\nBoyy’s special wonton-shaped bags are not only cute and dainty, but ultra-chic too. The brand carries a wide variety of styles, including its signature buckle styles, and you’ll get a wide range of colorways as well, all in high-quality materials like calf-leather or nylon.\nPrice range: $595-$1,700\nYou may know Alexis Bittar for bold, statement jewelry, but it’s time to get to know the brand’s purses as well. Made with the same craftsmanship and metalwork as the brand’s jewelry, why not level up your purse game, too?\nPrice range: $395-$745\nDouglas Poon’s glass bags have been a favorite of mine for a while. The unique, Victorian aesthetic of the bags is rather impractical, but that’s the beauty of them. These are definitely conversation-starter bags, just be super careful with them!\nPrice range: $250-$530\nBembien handbags have the quality of vintage leather bags, but the luxury of modern design. They’re perfect for everyday use, whether you’re trekking around the city or going on vacation.\nPrice range: $175-$390\nTalk about a two-in-one: Edie Parker’s signature Burn Bags also feature a connected lighter, so you’ll never be without one on a night out (or a morning journey home). \nPrice range: $295-$895\nThe Best Bags to Buy During Amazon’s Big Deals Day\nThe Best Amazon Fashion Deals to Shop Right Now\nShop These Deals on Amazon Shapewear \nThe 49 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon \n12 Best Ballet Flats With Arch Support\nA Hot Girl’s Guide to Amazon Halloween Costumes\n14 Jewelry Deals From Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days\n25 Suede Bags to Carry You Through The Fall Season\nThe Early Black Friday Fashion Sales to Shop Now\nShop Brands That Support Breast Cancer Awareness\nThe Launch: Fashion News to Know This September\n21 Best Lingerie Brands for Women in 2023\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Selena Gomez on Why Her Final Justin Bieber Breakup Led Her to Dump Instagram Too", "date": "2023-10-03 14:42:00", "text": "Selena Gomez was the most followed woman on Instagram when she deleted the app and gave control of her account to an assistant in 2018. In a new interview with Fast Company, Gomez explained that her final breakup with Justin Bieber in spring 2018, after their 8-year on-off romance, led her to dump Instagram too. \nBieber, of course, started dating his now-wife Hailey Bieber just months after, in June 2018. They got engaged a month later, and then married in September 2018. \nGomez recalled her headspace at the time: “I had just gotten my heart broken. I didn’t need to see what everyone was doing,” she said. “Then there were those moments of not feeling positive about how I looked because of what I’d see on Instagram. Wow, I wish my body looked like that.” \nShe explained having her own body change also impacted how she viewed herself. Before, she’d “had a teenager’s body,” she said. And now, “none of the sample sizes were fitting, and that would make me feel embarrassed. Although how unrealistic is it to expect a normal woman’s body not to change?”\nAt the same time, Gomez was navigating her own mental health. In 2018, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Two years later, she shared her diagnosis publicly on Miley Cyrus’ Bright Minded Instagram Live show.\nInitially, Gomez worried about the consequences of sharing her mental health struggles and condition. “I grew up being a people pleaser,” she said. “I had a responsibility at a very young age—young people were looking up to me. I didn’t know who I was. Having that responsibility would make me walk on eggshells a lot. I thought maybe it would be damaging to tell people who I am. It started to become a threat that freaked me out. Well, if you’re not right, then you can’t work.”\nShe reflected on the time just before she was diagnosed: “I went through a really hard season [then]. It was my highs and my lows, and I didn’t know what to do, so I couldn’t control it. I would want to cancel things. It was just a tormented feeling. That’s why, when I found out my diagnosis, it was just, ‘Oh, okay, I feel a bit relieved, I understand a bit more.’ I got second opinions. I went to doctors. I’m fortunate enough to be able to have people who can help me survive every day.”  \nAs a celebrity now, Gomez puts herself in a different category than stars like Beyoncé and Adele. “I’m not unattainable,” she said of herself generally. “I look at someone like a Beyoncé, and I am amazed. My jaw drops. Every part of her is just impeccable, and it’s just so beautiful. I went to her show and was blown away. But I’m just not that, and that’s okay. I’m me, and I’m a little silly, but I also like being sexy and fun, and I also want to do good with the time I have here. We need goddesses like Beyoncé and Adele. But I’m just happy to be your best friend.” \nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Haven’t Defined Their Relationship: It’s More ‘Hanging Out’ Than Dating", "date": "2023-10-03 14:49:00", "text": "While some fans online are already calling Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship a romantic comedy, Kelce and Swift themselves haven’t quite defined what they are, People reports. It’s absolutely not a full-fledged serious romance though, as sources have made clear over the last few weeks.\nTwo sources doubled down on this to People in a report published yesterday. “[They’re] still just getting to know each other,” the first source said. “It’s nothing too serious.”\n“He is a charming guy,” the second source added, noting there hasn’t been any define-the-relationship talk. “It’s more of a hanging out situation than dating.”\nMuch like how Swift is focused on her music and Eras tour, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end is putting his energy into his work while spending time with the singer. The source continued, “He’s focusing on football like he always has. During the NFL season, his priority is the Chiefs, and it’s all about the team.” \nThe Daily Mail ran its own new report about Swift and Kelce yesterday, with a source claiming that Swift really does like Kelce, and her friends like him for her. \n“We are hearing that Taylor is very much into Travis and is looking forward to seeing where things go,” that source said. “Her close girlfriends are glad she is with someone who shares the same values as her and is not in the entertainment industry. He seems to balance her, and his mom and family adore Taylor.”\nSources have consistently called Kelce and Swift’s connection casual. Their future is full of possibilities that they intend to explore out of the limelight. \nAs a source told Entertainment Tonight on September 28, “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime. So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.”\nSwift attended Kelce’s game on Sunday. The two stars were not seen together though, as Swift kept to her friend group and left the stadium with them. \nPage Six reported that Swift and Kelce had a Sunday morning hangout prior to the NFL game. Kelce was photographed leaving her apartment around 11 a.m.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "<i>Priscilla</i>: Everything to Know About Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla Presley Film", "date": "2023-10-03 15:03:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nLast year, Baz Lurhmann’s Elvis biopic was everywhere from the Met Gala to awards season. This year, it’s Priscilla Presley’s time to shine.\nSofia Coppola is writing, directing, and producing the film Priscilla, adapted from Priscilla Beaulieu Presley’s 1985 memoir, Elvis and Me. Cailee Spaeny, best known for roles in Mare of Easttown, Bad Times at El Royale, and On the Basis of Sex, will star in the titular role. Meanwhile Euphoria’s Jacob Elordi will star opposite her as the King of Rock n Roll.\nHere’s what else we know so far. \nHere’s the official synopsis from A24: \n“Her story was so vivid in my mind and the visuals of that world, Memphis, the ’60s. It’s so American,” Coppola told The Hollywood Reporter. “And I always like themes about finding one’s identity and teenage girls growing into adulthood.” \nThe filmmaker also connected to Presley’s story as someone who also came of age in the orbit of a towering cultural figure: her father, Francis Ford Coppola. “I know from my family what it’s like to be inside a show business family,” she added to THR.\nGiven its unflinching portrayal of Priscilla’s life, the film shows a side of Elvis that may be hard to watch for fans. These include his courting Priscilla when she was 14 and he was 24, choosing her clothes for her to wear, and giving her a black eye during a pillow fight, per THR. “It was a different time,” Priscilla Presley told Hollywood Reporter. “I lived in his world. I wanted to please him. I wanted to fit in. I wanted to have fun with him. I wanted to see what it was that he liked.”\nAside from Spaeny and Elordi, Succession's Dagmara Domińczyk plays Priscilla’s mother. \nThough Coppola considered a number of actors for the role of Elvis, Spaeny was always her first choice for Priscilla, Deadline reports. When she finally met with Elordi for coffee in New York, “all the girls in the room just turned to him, they gravitated,” she told THR. “I just felt like, ‘Yeah, he has that kind of charisma that I imagine Elvis had.’”\nThe team behind the scenes includes: cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, costume designer Stacey Battat, editor Sarah Flack, and production designer Tamara Deverell—all longtime Coppola collaborators, according to Variety. \nPriscilla arrives in theaters on November 3, 2023 via A24. It just premiered at Venice Film Festival in early September. Production began last fall in Toronto. \nCatch the teaser above and watch the official trailer below. \n“The people who are watching, they’re living it with you, and you hope and pray that they get it. They get your feelings, your hurts, your sensitivity,” the film's subject told THR. \nAt the premiere in Venice this month, Presley appeared to be moved and was seen wiping away tears at the end of the screening. She praised the film at a press conference after, saying “Sofia did an amazing job,” per Vulture. \nShe also took a moment to address some of the movie’s controversial moments, such as her age gap with Elvis and their sexual dynamic. \n“I was more of a listener,” she said, according to Vulture. “Elvis would pour his heart out to me in every way in Germany: his fears, his hopes, the loss of his mother, which he never, ever got over. I was the person who really, really sat there to listen and to comfort him. That was really our connection, even though I was 14 … I was older in life than in numbers.”\nShe added, “People think that was the attraction — it was sex. Not at all. I never had sex with him. He was very kind, very soft, very loving, but he also respected the fact I was only 14 years old. We were more in mind and thought, and that was our relationship … We built a relationship, and that relationship went on until, yes, I left, and it wasn’t because I didn’t love him. He was the love of my life. It was the lifestyle that was so difficult for me, and I think any woman can relate to that, but it didn’t mar our relationship. We still remained very close, and of course, we had our daughter, and I made sure that he saw her all the time. It was like we never left each other, so I want to make that clear.”\nThe estate is reportedly unhappy with Priscilla. TMZ reported in June that it was made without the estate's knowledge or consent. One official even told the outlet the film was “horrible.” \nIn response to the criticism, Prisicilla Presley told TMZ, “I am very excited to see the interpretation of my book by the masterful Sofia Coppola. She has such an extraordinary perspective and I have always been such an admirer of her work. I'm certain this movie will take everyone on an emotional journey.”\nElvis Presley Enterprises also turned down requests to include Presley's own music in the film. “They don’t like projects that they haven’t originated, and they’re protective of their brand,” Coppola told THR. “But that made us be more creative.” \n'Only Murders' Has Been Renewed for Season 4\nAll About the Only Murders Season 3 Finale\nWho Is Mike Jeffries, and Where Is He Now?\nWhat Happened Between Uche, Aaliyah and Lydia?\nBeyoncé Is Releasing a Renaissance Film\nThe 25 Best 'SATC' Guest Stars\nWatch a New Trailer for Fair Play\nPhoebe Dynevor on the 'Fair Play' Period Sex Scene\nWatch Every Episode of ‘Love Is Blind’ Season 5\nA Stirring Farewell to Sex Education\nWhat We Learned from The Super Models\nMeet the Cast of Love Is Blind Season 5\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Where Is Mike Jeffries, Abercrombie & Fitch’s Former CEO, Now?", "date": "2023-10-03 15:47:00", "text": "Netflix’s documentary White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch charts the messy trajectory of the once-cooler-than-cool mall store that peaked in the ‘90s and early 2000s, only to come crashing down after a string of racist, exclusionary controversies. The man at the center of the brand’s peaks and valleys? Mike Jeffries, A&F’s former CEO, who’s described by the documentary’s subjects as “private,” a “micromanager,” a creative “mad genius,” and simply “bizarre.”\nLeslie Wexner first brought California-born Jeffries onto A&F in 1992, hoping he could revamp the 100-year-old brand. At the time, Jeffries was known as the former president of Alcott & Andrews, a women’s retail chain that filed for bankruptcy in 1989. Wexner, on the other hand, was the king of retail; he was the CEO of A&F’s then-parent company L Brands, which owned stores like The Limited and Victoria’s Secret. The documentary describes how it was Jeffries’ strategy to center this new iteration of A&F around elitism, sex, and exclusivity. According to the doc, Jeffries had rigid perceptions of masculinity and femininity, which he infused into A&F’s image.\nJeffries also brought on famed photographer Bruce Weber, who’s credited with helping to establish the aesthetic of the company's golden age. (All those A&F shopping bags with black-and-white photos of half-naked men? Part of Weber’s vision.) In recent years, more than 20 current and former models have come forward to accuse Weber of sexual assault and exploitation. He has since settled two sexual assault lawsuits and has not admitted guilt. Wexner has also come under scrutiny for his close ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was found dead while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Wexner retired as CEO of L Brands in 2020 and left the board in March 2021.\nAt first, under Jeffries, A&F saw incredible success, and in 1996, he took the company public. But he was also the leader as A&F confronted scandal after scandal. In 2002, there were protests over racist T-shirts and suggestive thongs marketed to pre-teen girls.  A group of ex-employees sued A&F in a class-action lawsuit in 2003 for racial discrimination. (A&F settled for $40 million and admitted no wrongdoing.) And then there was the rare interview Jeffries gave to Salon in 2006. In the story, Jeffries is described as a “quirky perfectionist and control freak,” who always goes through the revolving doors at A&F headquarters twice and never passes other employees on the stairwells. During the interview, he infamously said: “Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.”\nFrom there, the controversies only continued to mount. In 2012, Bloomberg reported on an “Aircraft Standards” manual for the A&F executive jet, written by Jeffries’s longtime life partner Matthew Smith. (The manual was made public in an age-discrimination lawsuit brought against the company by a former pilot, according to Bloomberg.) The manual included 40 pages of highly detailed instructions, including what kind of underwear aircraft staff should wear and the seating arrangements for Jeffries’s dogs.  Then in 2013, BuzzFeed News published reporting that Smith was “one of the most powerful people” at A&F, even though he wasn’t technically employed and his role was “never formally reported” to shareholders. Per the report, “Two former executives used the word ‘dangerous’ when describing Smith, citing the fact that he is organizationally unaccountable if something were to go wrong with regard to a decision he’s made.”\nAfter reports of struggling sales, Jeffries finally stepped down from A&F in December 2014, nearly a year after he was removed as chairman. In June 2015, Samantha Elauf won a Supreme Court case against A&F after the company refused to hire her because she wore a headscarf.\nOnce he departed A&F, Jeffries mostly stayed out of the news. Some of the biggest updates were that in 2015, the company sold the corporate jet, and in 2016, Jeffries listed his Manhattan townhouse for $19.5 million. He then relisted it a year later for $16 million, per ELLE Decor, and it ended up selling in 2018 for $12.9 million.\nBut in 2023, he was back in headlines again after a BBC investigation found that a group of men alleged Jeffries and Smith exploited them for sex during events they hosted around the world. The outlet stated: “Two former US prosecutors who independently reviewed documents and testimony uncovered by the BBC have called for an investigation to determine whether charges for sex trafficking could be brought.”\nOne of the men told the BBC that Jeffries was the “kingpin” and that he “took advantage of people in a very vulnerable point in their life, especially when they’re around these big cities, coming from small America.”\nWhile neither Jeffries nor Smith have commented on the accusations, A&F told the BBC it’s “appalled and disgusted” by the alleged behavior and that new leadership has changed the company into the “values-driven organization we are today” with “zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind.”\nFran Horowitz is A&F’s current CEO, and under her, the brand has transformed, this time focusing on diversity, size inclusivity, and a more understated, trendier clothing selection. But much like the A&F cologne that smacks you in the face on your way into the store, Jeffries’s influence on the brand will always linger. \nWatch White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch on Netflix now.\nMadison is the digital deputy editor at ELLE, where she also covers news, politics, and culture.

{"title": "Gigi Hadid Struts the Miu Miu Runway With Hangover Hair", "date": "2023-10-03 16:20:00", "text": "Relatable. \nDo you remember your hair at the end of finals week in high school? Or the hair that your favorite bodega person sees on a weekly basis? Or perhaps it was just last week when you ventured outside to grab a bagel during NYC’s hurricane? \nSomewhere, somehow, Miu Miu saw your hair, put it on the inspiration board and added it to the runway for their Spring Summer 2024 show.\nAfter a full Fashion Month of very glamorous hair including the big hair bouffants at Schiaparelli, the sleek French twists at Dior, and pretty beach waves at Chanel, Miu Miu gave us greasy, oily, hangover hair and honestly, it was nice to feel seen. “It was greasy, stringy hair, I loved it,” a friend texted me after the show. From runway photos, the hair looked oily (not shiny), matted (not artfully tousled), clumpy (not as cute as Taylor Swift’s wet hair during the Eras tour), like the hairstylists played a game of “hide the dry shampoo” backstage.\nThe amount of dishevelment varied. From the neck up, Gigi Hadid looked like she was walking home after cramming for an all nighter at the library, paired with sequin board shorts and thick glasses. Model Rianne Van Rompaey’s hair was so lank and ropey, drawn into a low pony, that it reminded me of my hair at the end of any hike where I’ve ever gotten lost. It’s a slight departure from the staticky cloud hair of last season, in which the models looked like their heads were rubbed with helium balloons (and it turns out they were, to get the effect.) I probably don’t need to know how to get the Miu Miu hair look, but I’d love to know about the inspiration. \nKathleen Hou is ELLE\"s Beauty Director.

{"title": "Laphonza Butler Will Become the First Black Lesbian to Serve in Congress", "date": "2023-10-03 17:13:00", "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom tapped the EMILY’s List president to fill Dianne Feinstein’s Senate seat.\nLaphonza Butler, president of the political action committee EMILY’s List, will be Congress’s first-ever Black lesbian senator.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom tapped Butler to fill the Senate seat that was left empty after the death of Dianne Feinstein,  Politico reported. Her appointment marks a historic first for Congress, with Butler becoming the sole Black woman currently serving and the third-ever Black woman to ever serve in the Senate. She will also be the first openly LGBTQ+ Black woman to work in Congress.\n“I’m honored to accept Gov. @GavinNewsom’s nomination to be U.S. Senator for a state I have made my home and honored by his trust in me to serve the people of California and this great nation,” Butler said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “No one will ever measure up to the legacy of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but I will do my best to honor her legacy and leadership by committing to work for women and girls, workers and unions, struggling parents, and all of California. I am ready to serve.”\nButler has served as president of EMILY’s List, an organization that works to elect pro-choice Democratic women, since 2021.\nShe previously worked as the director of public policy and campaigns in North America for Airbnb, a strategist and partner at political consulting firm SCRB Strategies, and a senior advisor for Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign. She also has a long and involved history with the labor movement, having served as the president of home-care workers union SEIU Local 2015 for more than a decade. \nOther high-profile California Democrats are currently running for Feinstein’s seat—she was the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history prior to her passing at 90 years old—which will be up for grabs in the 2024 midterms. These include Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter, and Barbara Lee.\nCNN reports that Newsom had previously promised to appoint a Black woman if Feinstein, who announced earlier this year that she would not run for reelection, were to resign from her seat earlier than planned. Many had hoped the governor would select Lee, the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, as Feinstein’s replacement. However, Newsom opted to not choose any of the candidates participating in the 2024 Senate election, so as not to give any particular candidate an advantage over others ahead of time. Though Butler herself may choose to run for office next year, too.\n“As we mourn the enormous loss of Sen. Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for—reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence—have never been under greater assault,” Newsom said in a statement on X. “Laphonza has spent her entire career fighting for women and girls and has been a fierce advocate for working people.”\nHe concluded, “I have no doubt she will carry the baton left by Senator Feinstein, continue to break glass ceilings, and fight for all Californians in Washington.”\nAs an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news. She also writes on social movements, connecting with activists leading the fight on workers' rights, climate justice, and more.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nYou’re looking snatched and fiscally responsible.  \nI know it feels like Amazon Prime Day was just here, but it’s nearly time for the fall savings event, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days—mark your calendars for October 10 and October 11. There are bound to be more marked-down items than one person could possibly parse through, so we’re breaking down all the best goodies to shop during the sale, like the best jewelry deals, home deals, and even the best Amazon Halloween costumes. But for now, it’s all about the best shapewear deals. \nI am a big proponent of shapewear. The right piece can solve undergarment conundrums, boost confidence, and amplify looks. But it often does so at a hefty price tag. Is this capitalism preying on our insecurities? Probably, but you don’t have to stand for it any longer because Amazon carries tons of options at affordable price points. From butt-lifting shorts to full slip dresses, you can shop for whatever it is you need. Better yet, you can look to customer reviews and photos to help inform your decisions. But if you want to make the most of the Big Deal Days, you better get a head start. Here, preview some of the best shapewear on Amazon to add to your cart ahead of the savings event. \nA thong bodysuit like this is perfect for wearing under just about anything—including jeans and a T-shirt. \nThese are the No. 1 bestseller on Amazon for a good reason. Smooth yourself out from the waist to mid-thigh with these shorts. \nI love that this has shorts because it will also help prevent chafing if worn under a dress or skirt. \nWearing a tight dress on a girl’s night out calls for a shaping thong. \nDon’t forget that Spanx is available to shop on Amazon. Stock up on all your favorites during the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days. \nHere’s another mid-thigh option, but this one is strapless, which makes it even more versatile. \nAll shapewear should have a built-in bra, IMHO. But anti-static? A new bar has been set. \nFeel snug and secure under any formal gown (or casual maxi dress!) with this longline slip. \nWhile this is both stomach smoothing and booty lifting, my favorite part is the silky smooth fabric. \nYou shouldn’t have to choose between risqué necklines or shapewear. Opt for an open-chested shaper and get the best of both worlds.\nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "V.E. Schwab Is Rewriting the Rules of Fantasy (And Maybe Life Itself)", "date": "2023-10-03 20:03:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe author’s forays into alternate realities aren’t about escapism. They’re about power. \n“I am somebody who wants the world to be stranger than it is,” says Victoria “V.E.” Schwab, her voice dipping toward melancholy as she caps off the sentence. It’s a curious thought she presents—considering the world is, in fact, consistently and maddeningly bizarre—and yet one approaching the truth uniting the author’s works of fantasy, including the bestselling sensation The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue and her latest, the first entry in a new series: The Fragile Threads of Power. \nThese stories, which have built Schwab a sizable audience of not only Instagram followers (365K and climbing), but active, engaged readers across platforms and continents, are grounded in what Schwab calls a “point of departure” from reality. They are each set in a version of the world we know, but with an asterisk. So: In Addie, there is New York City, and there is Paris, but there is also a god made of shadow who grants wishes that double as curses. In Threads, there is London, but it is carved into multiversal quadrants, versions in various stages of grandeur and ruin: Red London, White London, Grey London, and Black London. There is magic in Schwab’s work, but it exists along familiar contours, never claiming faraway lands from which to flourish. \nSchwab’s been, as she puts it, “in this game” since 2009, pumping out books from the age of 19, work that she marks by three essential characteristics: 1) “deeply fleshed-out” characters; 2) a “slow” initial hundred pages, “because I’m laying the board for a game I’m asking you to play”; and 3) writing with a “very specific lyrical style.” She adds, with something of a shrug and a smile, “If you don’t like these three things, then my books probably aren’t for you.” \nShe’s right, at least in part. Her characters are beloved, if not exactly naturalistic. Her beginnings can grow turgid, though rewarding for the devoted. And her prose is that of a young poet, fond of frequent line breaks and overwrought descriptions but with a slippery, hypnotic cadence. Still, none of these factors are what ultimately make Schwab’s work so enticing. The appeal is not in the “stranger” world that she and her readers desire, but a landscape in which the real world’s power might become comprehensible—and therefore, finally, manageable. \nSchwab knew something of bifurcated realities as a child: She grew up between San Jose, California, and Nashville, Tennessee, moving back and forth repeatedly throughout her first 18 years. An only child, she considered herself self-sufficient well before she hit adulthood, and acquired friends as a natural “social mimic” who was “very, very intense in everything I did,” she says. She attended an all-girls preparatory school in Nashville, and she claims she “never” wanted to be a novelist; she wanted to be a World Cup soccer player. \nBut Schwab also enjoyed the expansive isolation of her own mind, where her imagination could nurture a sense of being “alone without feeling lonely.” When she first enrolled in a university, she attended for astrophysics before “leapfrogging around different departments” and signing her first book deal, which might as well have included her signature on the bottom line of life itself: A traditional career path would never be her lot. She’d been rooting around for this path for years, arguably ever since she picked up reading. \n“The first time I felt transported by a book, my reaction was of two minds,” she says. “It wasn’t even just to be transported. There was a part of my brain at the time that was like, This is power.” She continues, “I was intoxicated by the idea of the manipulation of words and [what] that could do to somebody else’s mind far before I ever wrote a novel.” \nEven as a teenager, Schwab was furious to have these powers of hers taken seriously. I ask if, in the years since she’s become a traditional publishing success story, she’s perhaps aged out of that insecurity. She replies, “I don’t think you can age out of it when you start in young-adult, and when you’re a woman who writes in fantasy.” \nAs a genre, the young-adult label fit her work like a girdle, squeezing it into a specific shape but smoothing the interesting bits along the way. Her first book, 2011’s The Near Witch, was a fairytale with a teenage protagonist, and “at the time, that automatically made it YA,” Schwab says, adding, “YA can be a beautiful section of the market. But it does feel like it has a lot of rules.” She was told that her books were unlikely to sell well—largely because she didn’t write within the strict parameters of the romance subgenre—and that each consecutive YA work would have approximately “two to six months to succeed” before bookshelves would be cleared for new entries, and hers lost to the ether of unlikely discovery. She continues, “The most traumatized authors I know are authors who are either in or have come through YA.” \nWhen Schwab made the leap to adult fiction with 2013’s Vicious, she expected a similar timeline for supposed “success.” After two months, she emailed her editor, assuming the deadline had arrived: They’d now decide if she’d sold enough copies to cinch herself another book deal. Her editor recommended, instead, that they circle back after two years. “That was this realization that books got to live longer lives in adult, and find readers at a slower rate,” Schwab says. “I needed that advantage because Vicious was never a bestseller, but it sold the same number of copies every year for seven or eight years.”\nThe publication of Vicious also announced the arrival of her twin literary identities: Victoria Schwab, with which she’d continue to release books like the Monsters of Verity and Cassidy Blake series, and V.E. Schwab, under which she’d pen her popular fantasies such as the Shades of Magic trilogy, the Villains books, the newly launched Threads of Power series, and her stand-alone novels including 2020’s Addie LaRue and 2022’s Gallant. (Some books would be released under Victoria and later under V.E.) The pseudonym was both a marketing tool and a self-protective measure: Such a gender-neutral name allowed her—in theory, anyway—to reach new audiences, as well as to create “a version of me that lives rent-free in people’s heads,” she explains. To her friends and family, she’s Victoria. But online, and to her many followers, she’s V.E., maker of tangential realities, not “the human who wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks my dog on the beach.” In other words, V.E. could have power, while Victoria could live. \nDuring the height of the pandemic, Addie LaRue took off—a miracle Schwab attributes, not entirely in jest, to its “very sexy villain.” But she recognizes the book was also “inextricable from the time in which it was published.” After its initial release in October 2020, Addie hit the New York Times bestseller list, but it was only after popular book-centric creators on TikTok (a.k.a. BookTok) championed the novel that it became a true phenomenon. Addie—about a twenty-something girl cursed to be forgotten by everyone she meets throughout multiple centuries, but who falls in love nevertheless—was the kind of book readers wanted, and perhaps needed, during COVID: “defiantly hopeful,” as Schwab puts it, and a tale of endurance across borders and eras and unbeatable odds. \nUnprompted, Schwab suggests that this, actually, is the real unifying theme across her books: the so-called “mastery” of death. She explains that, as a child, she fretted over her father, a type-one diabetic whose blood sugar levels she helped to monitor, and whose tenuous health created an environment where constant observation was paramount to survival. She concludes, “I just became convinced, if I pay enough attention to everything happening around me, I can control everything. And if you think about what writing novels is, it’s exercising control.”\nShe admits, but does not apologize for, how this rationale might come across. It’s “manipulation,” she says, and “wanting to have some power over a reader’s mind,” even if “it sounds narcissistic to put it that way.” Of course, creating fictional realities is an act of narcissism, perhaps one of the few narcissistic acts that might also serve a benevolent purpose. But this doesn’t upset Schwab. On the contrary, it thrills her. She talks of feeling powerless as a child, and how she searched rock faces in California hoping to find key holes, anything that might confirm her doubts that reality wasn’t—or shouldn’t be—what it seemed. When she came out as gay in her late twenties, it was further confirmation to herself that reality had always been different than what she’d initially perceived. Doors were opening. Light was coming through. As she chronicled in a coming-out essay for Oprah Daily in 2020, she exited a metaphorical “house,” and the world around her became suddenly stranger, and all the more beautiful. \nBut Schwab—and the world itself—did not actually become stranger; it was the perception of Schwab herself that expanded. \n“Good fantasy is only escapism for people who already have everything that they need and want in reality,” Schwab says. In other words: What the author, and her audience, really yearn for is the power—the tools of “manipulation,” as it were—to rewrite the stubborn, heartbreaking rules that govern our real world. It’s not that reality isn’t sufficiently strange; it’s that it’s so very hard to control.\nSchwab is currently on book tour for The Fragile Threads of Power, a nearly six-week trip spanning multiple cities across the U.S., Ireland, and the U.K. It’s a grueling schedule, especially as she’s much more accustomed to a regular writing routine from her favorite coffee shop in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she lives when she’s not traveling. “I like living in old places, in places that haven’t felt the need to choose between the realistic and the supernatural,” she says, citing her neighbors’ affection for ghost stories. “I feel like growing up in the States, by virtue of how young a country it is…it feels so resistant to the supernatural. You either have to be a believer or a non-believer.” \nThis split down the middle is a familiar source of both the author’s ire and inspiration. There’s always a separation—Victoria and V.E., reality and imagination, the strange and mundane—that Schwab wants to smother, or otherwise pull taut between her fingers like twine. And it extends to her publishing career, where she’s often felt shoved into disparate categories, whether on account of her success (or lack thereof); her gender; her sexuality; or her genre of choice. She wants the freedom just to be, to play, to write and be accepted for it without caveat, much in the manner of her literary icons: Imagine, if you will, Neil Gaiman or Stephen King ever needing introduce themselves as “best-selling male fantasy authors.”\n“It feels like I’m stuck with this choice,” she says. “I either downplay pieces of my identity: I take a gender-neutral pseudonym as I did. I try to be mainstream. I try to be palatable, and I still get disqualified. So then I try to be proud, and I try to be loud, and I try to be aggressively femme and gay, and I still get disqualified, where I still get put in a subcategory. And I just want to be like, How big do you have to get as a fantasy author before you don’t have to be caveated as something smaller?”\nIn the midst of this specific struggle, Schwab also has to contend with the demands of a shifting industry: Readers have come to expect a relationship with her over social media, whether in the form of her Instagram or her newsletter, featuring the cheeky title “The Visible Life of V.E. Schwab.” And she recognizes that even these engaged followers don’t necessarily belong to the same category. Some are Addie fans; others come for Shades of Magic; still others clamor for the third and final entry in her Villains series. Because she hops between books and series and settings, her audience is not a “homogenous” one. “Sometimes I get very panicky,” she admits, “because I think I can’t appease them all because I only write one book at a time.”\nAnd she feels, yes, “an immense pressure to perform author-hood,” she says. “I always am like, the person I’m most jealous of in this entire world is Donna Tartt. Talk about a person who’s just, ‘Take the myth of me and run! You’ll never see me.’ I’ll say to my friends, like, ‘What a dream. What a dream to just be a mythological figure.’”\nOf course, she seems to amend this notion the next time we speak: “The insanity-inducing thing is that I insist on being online. If I could not engage—but, to me, engagement is part of what I love.” It’s also part of the Sisyphean task of building a readership in an era where attention is a fickle currency. “The conversation I have with [my publicist] every week is like, Am I going to be relevant?” \nSchwab yearns to have an end goal in sight, both in the context of her life and in her fiction. She outlines every book with a specific ending in mind; she never begins a project without having already decided on its finale. But getting to that ending—that’s where she gets to experiment. For these periods, she can play in the ‘what if’ she recalls from a memory ironed in her teenage brain, when she went walking along a wooden fence and stumbled upon a door just beyond it. I’ll let the author tell it:\n“There was a door standing upright in this empty yard, as if the rest of the house had been razed around it, but this door has not been razed. And I remember reaching the end of this fence and standing there and staring at this door. My mind was like, What if I open that door, and it’s not the yard on the other side? But that same ‘what if’ is what prevented me from opening the door. Because as long as I didn’t open the door, as long as I only lived in the ‘what if,’ there was a potential that I would open the door and see somewhere else. The moment I opened the door and didn’t see somewhere else, it would suck. It would be a return to the norm. ” Ending this anecdote, she summarizes, “And reading is living in the potential of what could be, and not in the confirmation of what is.”\nThis statement, like Schwab’s desire for a “stranger” world, is not an entirely accurate one. Reading—even, or perhaps especially, in the fantasy genre—confirms exactly “what is”: that the world is strange; that it is inhabited by dark and terrible forces; that behind every door there is the opportunity for change. But sometimes the best way of navigating such an utterly confounding reality is not by approaching it unarmed. As Addie, and Vicious, and Threads all prove, sometimes it takes magic to see the monsters clearly—and to finally beat them back. \nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

{"title": "<i>Only Murders in the Building</i>’s Season 3 Finale Solves One Mystery and Introduces Another", "date": "2023-10-03 21:03:00", "text": "Ben’s killer is revealed, and so is the next victim. \nSpoilers below. \nWho killed Ben Glenroy? That’s the question the third season of Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building has revolved around, and the finale “Opening Night” gives us not one but two answers. \nMabel cracks the case almost immediately at the beginning of the episode, spurred by both Oliver’s sweet-talking reunion with his beloved dips (he’d been warned to stay off the stuff after suffering a heart attack a few episodes ago) and Howard finally piecing together the shredded message. By Mabel’s calculations, Ben—who had been fasting before the show—was tempted by a Shmackery’s cookie left in his dressing room by none other than Donna, Death Rattle’s producer, after she found out that Maxine’s review of the show (and specifically, Ben) was unfavorable. Donna sprinkled a tiny bit of rat poison on top of the cookie and sent him off to his dressing room with the suggestion to “be nice to Ben,” knowing he would take the bait, all in the name of saving the show.\nThe footage that Mabel and Tobert recovered earlier in the season of Ben talking to someone in his dressing room, and the lipstick message saying “fucking pig” on the mirror weren’t targeted attacks, but rather the unraveling of Ben’s psyche prior to him taking the stage. But Donna still holds the poisoned cookie. To add fuel to the fire, newly-free Loretta also hands over the bloody handkerchief found on Ben’s body, which has Donna’s exact shade of lipstick pressed perfectly into it. It seems like a hook, line, and sinker, and the gang hatches a plan to confront Donna and bring her down by luring her in with a new review of the revamped musical Death Rattle Dazzle. \nOn opening night, Mabel brings a bouquet of flowers to Donna with a note summoning her to the backstage offices. Before she goes, she offers her son Cliff two disturbing kisses (“one on the lips and one on the heart”) and tucks her own handkerchief in his pocket. Oliver, Mabel, Charles, and Tobert (with the boom mic) await her backstage to accuse her of the crime, and she confesses almost immediately. Her motive was to save the show by any means necessary, especially because it’s Cliff’s first production. While she didn’t mean to kill Ben (she only wanted to buy time for the show), when he reappeared later that night, she says she couldn’t risk him going on stage the next night. \nTobert records her confession for the podcast but she asks for one thing in return: Call the cops after the show. She wants to be there for opening night and deems herself “not a flight risk” due to her stage four lung cancer. They agree, but as Mabel watches Donna and Cliff from the wings, she realizes that Donna didn’t act alone. \nMabel follows Cliff up to a lookout in the rafters of the theater where she confronts him about pushing Ben down the elevator shaft. “One on the heart,” Mabel realizes, means that Donna’s lipstick-stained handkerchief wound up in Cliff’s suit jacket pocket, placing Cliff at the scene of the crime. Cliff doesn’t deny it, telling Mabel that Ben found out about Donna’s rat poison from toxicology reports. Ben remembers that Donna offered him the cookie and then offends Cliff by insinuating that he doesn’t have a brain of his own, and Cliff fights back saying that he never wanted to cast Ben in the first place—that he thinks he’s a superhero hack who can’t act. The two get in a scuffle that ends with Cliff, somewhat accidentally, pushing Ben to his death at the bottom of the elevator shaft.\nThe confession almost breaks Cliff, who refuses to let his mom take the fall for him, and he threatens to jump out of the rafter to his own death in the middle of the musical. But the warmth of his mom’s hand pulls him gently to safety. He apologizes and she forgives him before the two are carted out by the police; sadly, they don’t get to see that the musical received a good review after all. \nThe season’s fixation on the love between a mother and her son isn’t only resigned to Donna and Cliff’s odd dynamic; Loretta finally tells Dickie that she’s his biological mother. He says he knew it all along and quickly goes back to work as her agent, fielding offers far and wide in Hollywood. Oliver, reunited with the love of his life, finally lets go of control and encourages her to go and pursue her dream with Dickie by her side. As for their relationship, he says he’s just fine being with Loretta in short bursts. L.A. is also calling Tobert’s name for an indie film gig and Mabel turns down his offer to join him and find herself out west, saying that she needs to make herself “unstuck” in New York. \nEvery mystery story has red herrings, and that was especially true of this season of Only Murders in the Building. Many of the characters introduced as potential players had increasingly minor roles as the season went on—especially Ashley Park’s Kimber, who at one point was positioned as a major suspect. Jonathan, played by Jason Veasey, also got minimal screen time after he takes a drug cocktail in the finale that rendered him unable to go on for opening night, forcing Oliver (and not Howard, who desperately wanted the role) to take his place. Even Jesse Williams’ Tobert, who will be carrying on a bicoastal romance with Mabel for the foreseeable future, didn’t have much to do late in the season aside from a few funny one-liners. \nOnly Murders in the Building ends its third season similar to seasons past: by setting up yet another investigation for the true crime junkies’ true crime podcast. As the trio celebrates solving Ben’s murder, Sazz ( Charles’ former body double, played by Jane Lynch) crashes the party. Charles announces that he’s going to go get an Argentinian malbec wine from his apartment to keep the party going, and Sazz says that she needs to tell him something sensitive but puts off the conversation for the moment. \nUpstairs in Charles’ apartment, a single bullet pierces the window and the person inside topples over with blood gushing from their body.

{"title": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-03 21:26:00", "text": "It’s a love story that could actually be a Hollywood rom-com: The top American pop singer and the top American football player meet up, sparks fly, and they end up dating with the world watching. Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have dominated headlines since their romance was first rumored to be a thing, with Swift’s first appearance at Kelce’s game in Kansas City becoming one of the year’s most buzzed-about moments. \nWhile the two may not be official just yet, things are escalating quickly, and anything is possible in the future, sources have made clear.\nHere, the full history of their relationship that is known so far.\nKelce plays “Kiss, Marry, Kill” in an interview, with the choices being Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. “Damn, that’s messed up. I don’t want to kill any of them,” he prefaced. He then answered, “Ariana is kill, unfortunately. I love you, but you’re gone. And then Taylor Swift would be the kiss, and then Katy Perry would be the—what’s the last one? Katy Perry would be the marry.” The interview resurfaced in 2023 as the dating rumors with Swift began to gain traction.\nKelce discusses shooting his shot and missing while attending Swift’s Eras Tour show in Kansas City, Missouri on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason, an NFL player for the Philadelphia Eagles. Kelce’s remarks get media pickup.\n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce said. “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are a friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it. All right now.”\nJason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or phone number. \n“You know which one,” Kelce answered. “She doesn’t meet anybody and at least she didn’t want to meet me so I, um, I took that personal. But it was an unbelievable show and I’ve only seen Arrowhead filled like that for Chiefs games with that much excitement, and yeah, everybody was dressed in pink and purple going crazy. It was a wild show.”\nSwift and Kelce’s romance takes off this month. Here’s the play-by-play (pun very much intended).\nSwift goes out in New York City, wearing Foundrae’s Forever & Always a Pair Pendant, which has an opal teardrop stone on it. Fans note later that opal is Kelce’s birth stone (he is a Libra), and the necklace may have been an easter egg.\nThe Messenger reports that Swift and Kelce have been spending time together. “Taylor and Travis have been quietly hanging out,” a source told the outlet. “She saw him when she was in NYC a few weeks ago.”\nThat same day, another source told Entertainment Tonight that Kelce isn’t Swift’s secret new boyfriend: They are “not officially dating.” Sources will continue to stress this in the coming weeks.\nKelce’s brother Jason adds fuel to dating rumors during his appearance on the TNF Nightcap’s post-game interview.\n“I’ve seen these rumors…I cannot comment,” he said, noting that “ever since Catching Kelce [Kelce’s 2016 E! dating series], everyone’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life, so, I don’t really know what’s going on there. I know Trav is having fun, we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.”\nTony asked Jason about the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift dating rumors 😂@TonyGonzalez88 | #TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/iHHqDvWC9B\nThat same day, Kelce dodges questions about Swift during an interview with Andrew Siciliano. \n“I’m not gonna talk about my personal life,” Kelce said. “I know what you writers wanna hear, and you wanna hear more about that, and I’m not gonna give you anything.”\nJason jokingly confirms the Taylor-Travis dating rumors on Audacy’s SportsRadio 94 WIP. When asked about the gossip surrounding his brother and Swift, Jason said that “it’s hard to answer because I don’t really know a lot about Travis’ love life. I try to keep his business kind of his business, stay out of that world. But having said that, I think he’s doing great, and I think it’s all 100 percent true, and I hope this thing goes a mile.” Then he made it clear he was just kidding: “No, I’m joking, I don’t know what's happening.”\nThe Messenger also gets more intel on the relationship from Swift’s side that day.\n“She and Travis have hung out twice, and it’s nothing serious,” the source said. “She thinks he is very charming, and they have been texting this last week. He is a little embarrassed at how much attention they are getting, but he has told her he would love to continue seeing her.”\n“They are seeing where things go,” the source added, noting that Swift’s “friends are always playfully suggesting people to set her up with. [She’s] in her fun girl era and strictly having fun right now.”\nKelce says he invited Swift to his game during an interview with The Pat McAfee Show. She later does attend it.\n “It’s hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it’s like a game of telephone,” Kelce said of the dating rumors. “No one actually knows what’s going on, especially when you got [my brother] Jason Kelce on live television telling people both sides—he doesn’t know, it’s true, this and that.” \nRegarding his status with Swift, Travis gave a frank answer: “I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court. I told her, you know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit. So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”\nA source close to the situation tells E! that Swift and Kelce have no plans to see each other imminently, downplaying their closeness. \n“[They] met up once in New York,” the source said. “They’ve been texting and talking here and there but [have] no set plans to see each other again. It’s been very low-key as he’s been in season.” Obviously, that changes two days later.\nSwift takes up Kelce’s invitation and attends his game in Kansas City. She is photographed in the stands with his mom. Sources reveal later that it was her first time meeting his family, and it went well.\nSwift and Kelce are filmed leaving the game, marking the first video of them together.\nDaily Mail later reveals that Swift met Kelce’s friends and family at his home before going to the game. The outlet wrote that she spent an hour with them before boarding a party bus with them to the stadium. \nA source told Daily Mail, “Travis wasn’t at his house, but it was filled with his friends and family. He has a personal chef and several friends from high school and college who use his place as a crash pad whenever they are in town.”\nA source told People that day that, once again, Swift and Travis aren’t serious, but she was happy to see him play. \n“Taylor is very focused on work right now and hanging out with her girlfriends. Travis invited her to the game, and of course she said ‘yes,’” the source said. “She just thought it was a fantastic way to spend Sunday.”\nA source later added to People that “they’re having fun. This was Taylor’s first time meeting his mom and dad, and everyone was enjoying themselves. She was super chill and low-key hanging out with his friends and family.”\nKelce and Swift end their day celebrating with his teammates and family at Prime Social Rooftop. They get affectionate there.\nOutlets get more information on the post-game date. \nInitial reports claim that Swift and Kelce paid to rent out Prime Social Rooftop. In reality, they had a reservation.\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight, “Travis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis. The two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis’ teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 A.M.”\nTMZ was also told that Swift and Kelce were affectionate at the game’s after-party. “Sources say they were holding hands at the restaurant he rented out for his family, friends, and teammates after the game. At one point Taylor was sitting on Travis’ lap,” TMZ wrote.\nIn addition, multiple sources discuss Swift and Kelce’s current relationship status.\nTMZ was told by sources that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is not a publicity stunt, first of all. The sources shared that Swift and Kelce have seen each other “several times” over the last few months, but are not officially dating yet. Previous in-person meetings have been in a “very private setting,” per the sources.\nEntertainment Tonight’s insiders said that things between Swift and Kelce remain casual, but he has potential to be a good match for her. Swift specifically liked that he pursued her.\n“Travis has never shied away from his desire to give dating with Taylor a try, which he even said during a press conference a few months ago after seeing Swift in concert,” one source said. “Travis and Taylor are taking things slowly and not rushing into anything serious. Both are very career-focused, so the focus is on that for now, but that’s not going to stop them from enjoying life when it’s the right moment.”\nA second source added that “Travis and Taylor have a lot in common and they are having a great time getting to know each other. They have similar values. She likes that he pursued her and it has been easy and exciting for both of them.”\n“Taylor is enjoying some time off from touring and it’s been fun hanging out with Travis during this break,” the source continued. “Taylor wants a guy that’s into his career, does his own thing, but is also supportive and understands her, and Travis fits those qualities.” \nLast of all, a source told People that Swift and Kelce’s romance is in the “super, super early days.” That source added of their future, “They’re just hanging out, and there’s no pressure.”\nSwift is seen arriving at the airport in Kansas City around 10:30 A.M. to fly back home. Daily Mail reported that security vehicles were seen parked on Kelce’s street on Sunday and Monday nights in a clear sign that the two stars spent some private time together post-game.\nMultiple sources speak to Us Weekly that day about Swift and Kelce’s relationship. Once again, they say it’s not serious.\nOne Us Weekly source said that Swift met Kelce through a mutual friend: “They have been on a few dates, and Taylor is smitten with him. It is not serious, and Taylor is having fun right now.”\n“[She’s] working hard right now and not looking for anything serious,” the source continued, citing her tour schedule and his NFL schedule as reasons why a more committed romance would be more difficult. “But anything is possible. They’re getting closer and closer every day.”\nKelce speaks on his podcast New Heights for the first and maybe last time about his relationship with Swift.\n“I know I brought all this attention to me, right?” Kelce started. “I did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everyone how butt-hurt I was that I didn’t get to meet Taylor.”\nAt the same time, he has no any regrets. “You miss 100 percent of [the shots] you don’t take, baby, so yeah,” he said, then adding, “What’s real is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives. She’s not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like the McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\n“I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports…will kind of have to be where I keep it,” he said.\n“I’m on the roller coaster, the roller coaster of life,” Kelce added of the experience dating Swift. “Yeah, I notice a few things [are different], like paparazzi outside my house.”\nKelce gave Swift two shout-outs on the program: “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up [to the Chiefs game],” he said first. “That was pretty ballsy, that was pretty ballsy, yeah. I just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things about her, you know the friends and family. She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light, and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive.”\nOf the game generally, he said, “It was definitely a game I’ll remember. That’s for damn sure. And then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end.”\nHis second shout-out to Swift was simple: “Shout-out to Taylor for coming through and seeing me rock the stage.” \nLater that day, TMZ runs the first photo of Swift and Kelce showing PDA from the post-game party.\nAfter rumors emerge that Swift could be attending Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, a source confirms it to Entertainment Tonight. “Taylor Swift is planning on attending the Jets game this Sunday,” the source said.\nA second source added, “The Jets haven’t been notified specifically about Taylor coming to Sunday’s game, but are prepared to welcome her if she decides to come. Patrick Mahomes booked a suite for his family and friends and Taylor could be joining that suite.”\nIn a separate report, a different source told Entertainment Tonight that Swift wasn’t initially expecting much from her and Kelce’s time together, but things are changing. “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime,” the source said. “So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.” \nThe Daily Mail reports that the couple has allegedly discussed doing a Halloween costume together and potentially attending Heidi Klum’s famous Halloween party, a celeb-packed event. The “insider” said they joked about dressing as Barbie and Ken. \nThat source gave more detail on their dynamic, claiming that “the whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is okay with. He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”\nAs rumored, Swift attends Kelce’s Sunday night game against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. She brings a pack of celeb friends including Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sophie Turner, Hugh Jackman, and Sabrina Carpenter.\nSwift and Kelce aren’t photographed or filmed together during the game, truly keeping things more private. They left the stadium separately after the game. Page Six reported that Kelce was photographed leaving Swift’s apartment earlier in the day, although not because he spent the night Saturday. \nA source told Page Six that the two had a Sunday morning hangout, as Kelce adhered to his team’s 11 P.M. curfew on Saturday. He left Swift’s apartment around 11 A.M.\nAfter the game, Swift went to Zero Bond with her brother Austin Swift and his girlfriend Sydney Ness. Kelce was not photographed there with her.\nMultiple sources tell People that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is undefined.\n“[They’re] still just getting to know each other,” the first source said. “It’s nothing too serious.”\nA second source added that their relationship is casual and unlabeled: “He is a charming guy. It’s more of a hanging out situation than dating,” that source said. They added that while Kelce is spending time with Swift, “he’s focusing on football like he always has. During the NFL season, his priority is the Chiefs, and it’s all about the team.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "All About Brad Pitt’s Girlfriend Ines de Ramon, Who He’s Been Dating for a Year", "date": "2023-10-03 21:38:00", "text": "Just weeks after Brad Pitt was rumored to be seeing Emily Ratajkowski (who went on to reportedly date Pete Davidson for a couple weeks), the 59-year-old actor seems to have a different new woman in his life. The Daily Mail ran photos of Pitt at a Bono concert on Nov. 13 with Ines de Ramon, a 32-year-old Swiss jewelry professional. The Daily Mail claimed it was informed by sources that de Ramon was part of Pitt’s team. People, meanwhile, reported that de Ramon works for the jewelry brand Anita Ko. Her LinkedIn lists her position as vice president of the company.\nIn photos, Pitt appeared putting his arms on de Ramon, and introduced her to his friends there, including Cindy Crawford. De Ramon is recently single herself, having separated from her husband, Vampire Diaries actor Paul Wesley, in September 2022. \nReports on her relationship status with Pitt were initially a little conflicting, with People reporting them as dating and E! reporting they’re just friends. People described de Ramon as Pitt’s “girlfriend” in a report published on December 16, and the two were then seen together getting out of a car in Hollywood on Pitt’s 59th birthday on December 18, 2022.\nNew Year's Eve made it clear though: Pitt and de Ramon are dating and rung in the New Year on vacation in Cabo. On January 3, 2023, Page Six ran paparazzi photos of the two topless on their trip. The couple went on to celebrate their one-year anniversary in September 2023.\nSo, who is de Ramon? Here, the essentials and all the details on her connection to Pitt.\nWhile neither de Ramon nor Pitt have commented on reports that they’re dating, The Daily Mail ran photos of them at a Bono concert together on November 13. The outlet reported they arrived together in Pitt’s Tesla at 8 P.M. They left separately, de Ramon in Pitt’s bodyguard’s SUV and Pitt in his Tesla. \nInterestingly, the source was indicated as close to de Ramon rather than Pitt. The source said, “[they] have been dating for a few months,” and that “Brad is really into” de Ramon. “They met through a mutual friend. She is very nice.”\nA second source, this one close to Pitt, confirmed they were dating, but casually. “[They] recently started dating. [But] it’s not an exclusive relationship. Ines is cute, fun and energetic. She has a great personality. Brad enjoys spending time with her,” the source said.\nA source told E! that same day, meanwhile, that Ines is “a friend of his.” Of the dating rumors, the source added, “This has been assumed in the past and has been wrong.” Hmm...\nPeople reported on December 16 that de Ramon and Pitt were acting particularly coupley at the after party for the Los Angeles premiere of his film Babylon the night before. The two were seen “mingling with guests, occasionally with their arms around each other,” the outlet wrote. It marks the two's first big public sighting together since dating reports broke in November.\nDe Ramon and Pitt ended 2022 together—and gave the public definitive proof they're a couple in vacation photos of them lounging pool-side, topless together. De Ramon's back was turned to the camera while Pitt sat next to her, both sitting, talking, and reading by the water. No one else appeared around them in shots taken. Page Six ran the pictures here.\nPeople also reported that the two spent New Year's Eve together in Cabo days before Page Six published photos. A source told People on January 2, “They are dating and having fun. They have a good thing going on. There is no stress. Brad is enjoying it.”\n“[He] is not seeing anyone else right now,” the source added, suggesting that things may be becoming a little more serious. “He is spending more time with Ines. He is very happy.”\nA few days after their vacation, a source told ET that the new couple are “excited about where things are headed.” \nThey continued, “Ines took a bunch of time off from work during the holidays to celebrate with Brad and spend New Year's Eve with him. They had a great time in Cabo just relaxing and having fun together.” \n“They're a great match and have a good thing going,” they added. “They have a lot in common and Brad likes how chill and low-key Ines is. They're excited about where things are headed.”\nPitt isn’t the only actor that de Ramon has been with. De Ramon and The Vampire Diaries’ Paul Wesley announced their separation after three years of marriage in September 2022. Wesley and de Ramon were first romantically linked in July 2018.\nA rep for the couple told People in September that “they have separated” and have been living apart for several months. “The decision to separate is mutual and occurred five months ago. They request privacy at this time,” the rep added.\nOn Friday, February 17, Wesley filed for divorce in Los Angeles listing the reason for their split as “irreconcilable differences,” according to People. The divorce petition says that the former couple's assets split will be decided at “trial or by stipulation.”\nFollowing news that Pitt sent de Ramon flowers from afar for Valentine's Day, a source, identified as a “close friend” of Pitt, spoke to Daily Mail in late February about the two's connection. They have supported each other through their divorces. “Ines does the same for Brad who is unfortunately still dealing with his messy divorce from Angie,” the source said. “They actually bonded over their divorces and are quite serious. She has met most of his kids.”\nThe source claimed that Pitt's romance with de Ramon has been very different from his previous. “She is zero drama and very low-key,” the source said. That source also said that he doesn't care about how Jolie or de Ramon's ex Paul Wesley see their romance. “He especially doesn't give a damn what Angie thinks,” the source said. “In fact he wants her to know that he is happy with someone else. Brad does not care what Paul thinks of him, nor what Paul thinks of him dating Ines. Even though Paul is out of the picture, Brad and Ines are going to continue keeping it on the DL.”\nPitt and de Ramon celebrated their one-year anniversary in September 2023, with a source speaking about their relationship in detail to Us Weekly. “[Their] relationship is stronger than ever,” the source said. “[They] spend almost all their free time together.” That source noted de Ramon is close to Pitt’s friends, too.\n“Brad still hasn’t introduced his kids to Ines,” the source said. “It’s not that he doesn’t love Ines, it’s just that he wants to ensure this relationship is going the distance before he takes that major step.”\n“He’s dated a few women over the years but hasn’t introduced any of his children to them,” the source added. Pitt is “happy” with his and de Ramon’s current status. “[He] isn’t in a rush to push things unless it unfolds organically.”\nDe Ramon is a graduate of the University of Geneva, earning her bachelor’s in business administration. Her LinkedIn indicates that she speaks five languages, with French, English, and Spanish indicated at a bilingual or native proficiency, and German and Italian listed at a professional working proficiency. Prior to working at Anita Ko in Los Angeles, de Ramon spent four years working in the retail department of jewelry company de GRISOGONO.\nFollowing news that she and Pitt may be dating, de Ramon appeared to set her Instagram to private. De Ramon has appeared before on Wesley’s Vampire Diaries co-star Nina Dobrev’s Instagram when she and Wesley were still together.\nOne photo of her remains on her ex-husband’s Instagram too:\nDe Ramon has managed to keep public information about herself very limited, despite her marriage to Wesley and current rumored ties to one of Hollywood’s biggest stars. Pitt is likely to guard details of their relationship too, should it continue or become more serious, as the actor has not spoken much about any particular woman he has dated following his 2016 divorce from Angelina Jolie.\nTuesday, February 14, was of course Valentine's Day, and de Ramon, was spotted in Los Angeles carrying an oversized bouquet of pink peonies, according to the Daily Mail. A source told People that the flowers were from Pitt, a romantic gesture for the holiday.\nPitt was in New York City for Valentine's Day, filming his latest movie Wolves.\nOn Friday, February 24, Pitt and de Ramon were seen together in Paris at Fouquet’s on the Champs-Élysées, seated next to each other amongst a larger group. The short clip was shared by the publication Paris Match on Twitter. In the clip, de Ramon is wearing a shimmering spaghetti strap silver dress and Pitt was in a black tuxedo. \nExclusif : Brad Pitt et sa petite amie Inès de Ramon au Fouquet’s des Champs Élysées, après la cérémonie des César. #Cesar2023 #bradpitt pic.twitter.com/QZB6N72kxE\nThe actor was in Paris for the 48th César Film Awards, where he was tasked with presenting Fight Club director David Fincher with an honorary award. A source told People the couple did not travel to France together, but arrived separately a day apart. \nA source told People on Thursday, July 27, that things are “going very strong” for the couple and “they are doing great.”\nThe actor has been in Europe filming a movie, but production was put on hold following the SAG-AFTRA strike. She has managed to see him throughout the season and filming.\n“The two have been spending a lot of time together this summer as they truly enjoy each other’s company and are very into each other,” the insider said. “It’s apparent to anyone who sees them together.”\nDe Ramon has also been visiting the Château Miraval which Pitt and his ex-wife Angelina Jolie have been contesting one another over in court.\n“He still keeps a residence at Château Miraval and has been spending a lot of time there and elsewhere in Europe,” the source explained.  “And Ines has been flying in to see him several times.”\nOn Wednesday, August 23, de Ramon was photographed wearing a “B” pendant necklace which some are connecting to her rumored beau. The jewelry designer was drinking a green smoothie and walking her dog in black athletic wear. The pair are coming up on a year of dating, but a source told ET a few days after the necklace sighting that they are “happy being low-key.”\n“Brad and Ines are still seeing each other and having fun,” the insider said. “They enjoy each other’s company and have similar interests. They’re both creative, like to travel, and are happy being low-key. Things are good between them, but Brad isn't rushing anything.”\nThey added, “Brad is very careful and intentional about who he dates. He likes to ease into things and let things grow naturally.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Relationship", "date": "2023-10-03 21:49:00", "text": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's big Netflix docuseries has arrived. Titled Harry & Meghan, the six-episode series focuses on the life and love story of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and promises an unprecedented, intimate look into the couple's relationship. It also promises a lot of inside intel on the royal family in general. Volume I of the six-episode series is now streaming, with the second volume arriving on Dec. 15. \nIn one trailer for the project, Harry admits, “It's really hard to look back on it now and go, ‘What on earth happened?’”\nHarry & Meghan. A Netflix Global Event.Volume I: December 8Volume II: December 15 pic.twitter.com/WpFzVEC7Yx\nTo help make sense of it all, here's a short primer on the couple's relationship so far.\nAll the couple would say at first was that they were introduced by friends in the summer of 2016, but two years later E! News revealed it was Harry's childhood friend Violet von Westenholz who introduced him to Meghan.  \nVon Westenholz had met Meghan while working in PR with Ralph Lauren. The Suits actress had been in London for a while and making friend with “the high society set really easily,” the source explained. After Harry confided his dating issues in his friend, Meghan came to her mind. The Prince had actually never watched Suits, and was very pleasantly surprised when he met his future wife for the first time. There was an instant attraction.\nIn Harry & Meghan, the couple clarified that they first interacted on Instagram before going on their first date. \n“Meghan and I met over Instagram,” Harry said. “I was scrolling through my feed and someone who was a friend had this video of the two of them, it was like a Snapchat, and it’s … with doggy ears and ... that was the first thing, it was like who is that?”\nHe added, “And then we got each other’s numbers and we were just constantly in touch, and I went, ‘Let’s meet.’” They ultimately met at 76 Dean Street in London. Meghan recalls that her now-husband was half an hour late, but he was “so sweet” and “genuinely so embarrassed” for his tardiness. “He was just so fun,” Meghan added. “Just so refreshingly fun. And that was the thing, we were like childlike together.” \nIn an interview just after their engagement, Harry shared the story of their first few dates. \n“We met once and twice back-to-back, two dates in London, last July,” he said. “Beginning of July. Then, it was three maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to join me in Botswana, and we camped out with each other under the stars.”\nMeghan added, “It was definitely a set up, it was a blind date.”\nShe added that the fact that Harry was a member of the British royal family wasn't the most important thing to her — she just wanted to date a nice guy.\n“Because I'm from the States, you don't grow up with the same understanding of the royal family,” she said. “And so, while I now understand very clearly there's a global interest there, I didn't know much about him, so the only thing I asked her when she said she wanted to set us up—I had one question—I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn't kind, it didn't seem like it would make sense. And so we went, and had met for a drink, and then I think very quickly into that said, ‘Well, what are we doing tomorrow? We should meet again.’”\nThe tabloids caught wind of their relationship pretty quickly, essentially forcing an official confession from Kensington Palace a few months later. Harry's public statement about the fact that he and Meghan were dating was really a condemnation of the media's “abuse and harassment” and racism targeting her. \n“It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm,” the statement reads. “He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his.”\nUnfortunately, this was just the beginning of difficult conflicts the couple would face with the British public and their own family.\nThe couple made their first public appearance together with Meghan supporting Harry as he played in a charity polo match. The Duchess is often seen over the years supporting her husband from the sidelines as he plays his favorite sport.\nAfter being introduced to his immediate family, Meghan was Harry's plus one at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, Kate Middeton's sister. Pippa married James Matthews in Bucklebury, England. Evidently, Meghan was not at the wedding ceremony, but Harry drove 100 miles to pick her up at Kensington Palace, London, then back to the Berkshire village of Englefield for the rest of the festivities. \nAt the time, ELLE UK reported that it is “against royal protocol for members of the royal family to upstage proceedings,” and the public's interest in Meghan would have definitely stolen some attention from the bride on her big day.\nThe couple traveled to Botswana, Africa, for the former actress's 36th birthday and to introduce her to some of his friends in the area. \n“He was thrilled to bits that he could introduce her to them,” a source told US at the time. “The celebration began almost the minute they touched down. … Meghan was speechless and so touched.”\nRumors of an imminent engagement were running wild at the time.\nMeghan made an appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair, revealing the depth of her romance in the interview.\n“We’re a couple. We’re in love,” she told the magazine. “I’m sure there will be a time when we have to come forward and present ourselves, and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.”\nLater that same month, she was seen with Harry at the Invictus Games, the charity he founded for war veterans of outstanding athletic achievement. Also in attendance was Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland.\nThis was also the month where Meghan was first introduced to the Queen at the monarch’s summer residence, Balmoral Castle. \nThough she'd been spending a lot of time in the U.K., Meghan still had to finish shooting her role on Suits. In late November 2017, it was reported that she was an official London resident.\n“Meghan has officially moved out of her Toronto apartment,” a source told US Weekly. “Movers were seen there yesterday and today. Meghan’s furniture from her Toronto home will be going into storage and her personal belongings are being sent to the UK.”\nThe actual engagement supposedly took place earlier in the month, but it was announced on November 27.\n“His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,” the official statement read. “His Royal Highness and Ms. Markle became engaged in London earlier this month. Prince Harry has informed Her Majesty The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince Harry has also sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents.”\nMeghan's ring was designed with diamonds from one of Princess Diana's brooches, connecting her to her late mother-in-law.  In an interview with the BBC, Harry said, “The ring is obviously yellow gold, because that's her favorite, and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana, and the little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection, to make sure she's with us on this crazy journey together.”\nMeghan discussed in the same interview how she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's grandmother. “She's an incredible woman,” she said.\nIn Harry & Meghan, the couple shared how exactly Harry popped the question: he got down on one knee on a blanket outside Kensington Palace. “In the North garden, being overlooked by the staff flats, I got 15 of those electric candles,” he said. “Of course I got down on one knee. Of course I did.” \nMeghan knew her answer immediately. “He’s down on one knee and I was just like, ‘Yes!’” she said in the doc. “We were so joyful and excited. I was like, ‘Ah, we’re doing this!’”\nIn a gorgeous ceremony at the traditional St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, the couple officially wed on May 19, 2018. Forbes reported that 29 million people tuned in for the live-broadcast, and there were 600 guests in attendance. Meghan wore a Givenchy dress designed by Clare Waight Keller with a boat neck and elegant train, which she adorned with Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara.\nThis couple announced their first pregnancy on Instagram, writing, “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.”\n“Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.”\nThe announcement came out as they embarked on a 16-day royal tour through Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand. After arriving home, they settled in at Windsor Castle's Frogmore Cottage.\n“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child,” their office said at the time in a statement to People. “Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate.”\nArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born on May 6, 2019, in London. In a statement on Instagram, the Palace announced, “Their Royal Highnesses’ son weighs 7lbs. 3oz. The duchess and baby are both healthy and well, and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives.”\n“It has been the most amazing experience I could have ever possibly imagined,” Harry said to reporters just afterwards. “How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension, but we're both absolutely thrilled and so grateful for all the love and support from everybody out there.”\nIn a controversial decision, Meghan and Harry announced that they are stepping back from their duties as working members of the Royal Family and planning to make the move to the U.S.\n“After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution. We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen,” they wrote in a statement on Instagram.\n“We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages,” they continued. “This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.”\nBREAKING: Prince Harry: \"There was no other option.\"Prince Harry has revealed he and Meghan felt they had no other option but to leave the Royal Family behind during a speech for his Sentebale charity.Read more here: https://t.co/2tNh1kBEXM pic.twitter.com/8plUnoJlX5\nThe couple settled into the neighborhood of Montecito, California, where life seems to move at a more relaxing pace. \n“This kind of stuff is so basic, but it’s really fulfilling and about getting back to basics,\" Meghan told Bustle of their hobby of raising chickens and living a regular family life, comparatively. \nA few months later, The New York Times reported that the pair signed a multi-year deal with Netflix through their new production company, for “documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows, and children’s programming.”\n“Our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope,” the couple said in a statement. “As new parents, making inspirational family programming is also important to us.” \nIn an essay for The New York Times, Meghan revealed she had a miscarriage over the summer.\n“After changing his [Archie's] diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right,” she wrote. “I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.”\nMeghan and Harry signed a multi-year deal with the music and podcast streaming giant, through their company Archewell Audio, named after their son. \n“What we love about podcasting is that it reminds all of us to take a moment and to really listen, to connect to one another without distraction,” Harry and Meghan said in a statement. “With the challenges of 2020, there has never been a more important time to do so, because when we hear each other, and hear each other’s stories, we are reminded of how interconnected we all are.”\nMeghan's show Archetypes begins airing in 2022 and is an instant hit.\nThe couple shared another photo through a friend of their new expectation, this time a daughter.\nOn Valentine’s Day, they said in a statement to US Weekly, “We can confirm that Archie is going to be a big brother.”\nHarry and Meghan sat down with Oprah Winfrey for a special tell-all interview about their decision to step back as royals and what their lives were like in the palace. \nThe couple made some big revelations during the sit-down, including Meghan detailing the racism she experienced in the U.K. and that someone in the royal household made comments on their future child's skin color. Meghan also discussed her mental health struggles while dealing with the pressures of royal life. She recalled that at one point, she “just didn’t want to be alive anymore.” Harry also said he felt “really let down” by his father, King Charles, and that his relationship with his brother, Prince William, “is space, at the moment.”\nLilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on June 4, and named in honor of her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who was lovingly called Lilibet by family. Her middle name was clearly intended to honor Harry’s mother, Princess Diana. They call their youngest Lili for short.\nAfter several years away, and some back-and-forth over safety issues for the family, Meghan and Harry returned to the U.K. to celebrate the Queen's 70th year as a monarch, her Platinum Jubilee.\nThe family gathered together once more at Windsor following the Queen's death in September 2022. After rumors of frosty relations between Harry and his brother Prince William, the two brothers were seen with their wives greeting mourners and surveying the tributes left in the Queen's honor.\nHarry and Meghan spoke about their first date, engagement, and wedding at length for the first time, along with what led them to step back from their senior royal family roles.  \nHarry acknowledged he may never receive an apology from his family or the institution for all that happened. “And I’ve had to make peace with the fact that we’re probably never going to get a genuine accountability or a genuine apology. My wife and I, we’re moving on. We’re focused on what’s coming next.”\n“There’s times when I’ve been angry, but I can’t be that angry because I genuinely feel that I, and we, are exactly where we’re supposed to be,” he added in the last episode's final minutes. “We’ve made it to the other side.”\nNotably, Harry details Kate's icy reception to Meghan from the very beginning. He wrote that Kate was likely “on edge,” understanding that she was now “going to be compared to, and forced to compete with, Meg.” \nIn late March 2023, Harry returned to the UK to appear in court for the legal case he and several other public figures were waging against Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL), which are the publishers of British tabloids The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. In a witness statement, via People, he discussed how his relationship with Meghan Markle led him to become more concerned about the tabloids' treatment of them. \nThe press's treatment of Meghan made him \"increasingly troubled by the [royal family's] approach of not taking action against the press in the wake of vicious persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles concerning Meghan,” he said in the statement. He noted the “the situation got worse” when Meghan was pregnant with their first child Archie.\nHarry stated that this claim is “not just about me. I am bringing this claim because I love my country and I remain deeply concerned by the unchecked power, influence and criminality of Associated. The evidence I have seen shows that Associated's journalists are criminals with journalistic powers which should concern every single one of us. The British public deserve to know the full extent of this cover up and I feel it is my duty to expose it.”\nIn June, Meghan and Harry ended their deal with Spotify and their Archewell Audio division announced that they “have mutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series [Meghant’s Archetypes] we made together.”\nA source talking to People said part of it was the podcast production at Spotify, and part of it was personality-based.\n“What works in podcasting is authenticity and intimacy and revealing things either about yourself or about a topic that says something that [listeners] haven’t really thought about,” the insider said. “None of that happened. And Meghan wasn’t prepared to do that, because she lives an incredibly guarded life.”\nAnother source close to Archetypes’ production said that Meghan and Harry “were given no formal lay of the land to kick things off, so they were already on unsteady footing even before the ink was dry.”\n“Things moved very slowly on both ends,” the source said. “It was rare to have a direct conversation with them, so everything had to flow through a million middle persons.\"\nAnother source told Us Weekly that Meghan and Harry are “regrouping.” \n“They want to figure out how they can best expand the entertainment side of things,” they said, adding that the couple felt “snubbed” by Emmys voters when their Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan received no nominations. \nGossip outlet DeuxMoi, and tabloid Radar Online, began alleging that Meghan and Harry were “taking time apart.”\nOne source told Radar, “The Sussexes are under tremendous financial pressure to fund their lavish California lifestyle, including their $14 million mansion and huge security costs. That stress coupled with their emotional issues has likely made life a living hell. Taking time apart on different continents will hopefully help them find whatever they need to move on.”\nBut Page Six spoke to a source who said, “It’s not true, it’s literally made up.”   \nThe rumors were apparently very annoying to the couple, and a source told Us Weekly that Harry and Meghan were complaining about the media’s treatment of them since their Spotify deal ended. \n“It seems to be one assault after another these days, with people lining up to take cheap shots at them,” one source said. “Quite frankly, both she and Harry are sick and tired of it.”\nAnother source said they have “a ton of exciting things in the pipeline. [They’re] ready to come back stronger.”\nThe pair are “really happy together” in California, according to a source speaking with People. \n“They seemed really happy together,” the family insider said. “Harry seems to be embracing this life he has with Meghan and knows it’s a very different one than he had before, of course.”\nThey added, “Meghan does seem to run the household and make the decisions, but it’s not that he bends for her. It’s just a dynamic that works for them, and maybe one that he needs after everything he’s been through.”  \nThe couple attended Beyonce's concert at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood over Labor Day Weekend. They shared a private box with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland and friend Abigail Spencer. The group was dressed in silver, per the singer's request for her birthday. Meghan wore a sparkling pencil skirt and white crop top and Harry had on a silver blazer.\nFans filmed the couple dancing together before Meghan hugged Harry close for a kiss. She then continues dancing with an arm around him affectionately. \nAfter attending the Düsseldorf Invictus Games in Germany, Meghan and Harry snuck in a little vacation to Portugal, local publication Nova Gente and People report. People noted that the couple likely visited Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank there. Eugenie and Brooksbank are splitting their time between the U.K. and Portugal due to Brooksbank’s job.Additionally, Eugenie recently welcomed her second child, Ernest, who was four months old at the time of Meghan and Harry’s visit. Meghan and Harry likely met him for the first time.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "13 At-Home Laser Hair Removal Devices That Actually Work", "date": "2023-10-03 21:50:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFlawless skin with just one zap.\nWhile you might be feeling down about the end of summer, the fall and winter seasons are the perfect time to finally test out some of the best at-home laser hair removal tools. Even though the convenience of using your favorite razor in the shower is an excellent option for hair removal, it can be tedious, result in ingrown hairs, and become an exhausting process if what you’re after is skin as smooth as a baby seal. If you’re anything like me, using an at-home hair removal device is equally thrilling and terrifying. I find shaving tedious, but my first foray into permanent hair removal didn’t go well. After spending hundreds of dollars at an esthetician’s office, I found laser hair removal was not effective enough to justify the pain. Because I’m someone who can easily cosplay as Snow White (pale skin, dark hair, high tolerance for short men), I’m the ideal candidate for laser hair removal. But alas, I had to give it up for the sake of my sanity and my wallet.\nI thought I was resigned to using a razor forever. Then, I stumbled upon the Braun IPL Silk Expert Pro device. Not only was it significantly cheaper, less painful, and less humiliating than the salon service, but I actually started to see results quickly. For all of the many methods of body-hair removal out there—from shaving with the best razors to sugaring to waxing—laser hair removal (both professional and at home) is the only strategy that promises more permanent results. \nAt-home handheld hair removal devices come in two categories: IPL or a diode laser. Most at-home laser hair removal devices rely on IPL—intense pulsated light—therapy, in which tiny beams of light at different wavelengths zap the bulb within each hair follicle. “In essence, it is using heat to destroy the hair follicles,” says dermatologist Dr. Marisa K. Garshick, who mentions that dermatologists also use versions of IPL for photo rejuvenation procedures (a.k.a. fading dark spots). On the flip side, diode laser technology uses one single wavelength of light, which experts say can help minimize damage to the surrounding skin and be used safely on all skin types and shades. The light is selectively absorbed by the pigment, or melanin, within the hair follicle, making it a more targeted (and often more effective) approach to hair removal. \nAccording to dermatologist Dr. Karan Lal, it’s important to note that most at-home devices are “best suited for small to medium hairs in small areas—upper lip, chin, cheeks, bikini, etc.,” he says. “They are typically not meant for large surface areas like the back.” (There are a few exceptions, but we’ll get to that later).\nTo help you wade through the treacherous waters of the World Wide Web, we consulted our experts and customer reviews to find the 13 best at-home laser hair removal devices for women. \nFeaturing a sensor that adapts the light intensity to your skin tone, this FDA-approved device strikes the perfect balance between safety and efficacy. For sensitive skin, there are also three “comfort modes” to choose from: normal, gentle, or extra gentle. The device comes with two interchangeable heads for more precise results in different areas like the face, armpits, and bikini line. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’m eight weeks in and it has worked even better than I’d hoped. Other than a few stray hairs, my legs are completely hairless, and I have no need to shave between treatments.”\nAccording to some reviewers, this device is best suited for those with very dark and/or coarse hair. It’s equipped with an LED screen to track how many light pulses have beamed onto each area—though you may need to wear safety goggles (which are included) while operating. Each lamp comes programmed with enough pulses to last for up to five years. When it runs out, you can order a replacement cartridge and keep the handle.\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “If you’re a female with the unfortunate gift of facial hair, do not hesitate—buy this one! I have fair skin and thick black hairs, which make me a great candidate. I’m on my sixth treatment, and my chin hairs are growing back finer and slower. I’ve also used this on my armpits with great success.”\nIn a perfect world, most at-home laser hair removal devices would be equipped to be used forever and ever. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly the case, but this device comes pretty close. Fitted with 600,000 flashes, which equals about 40-plus years of full-body treatments, you can bet this tool will be in for the long haul.\nBest for: Fair to dark complexions\nHair color: Black and brown hair\nNood rating: 4.7/5 stars\nA Nood reviewer says: “The flasher is easy to use and I am already starting to see results in the first four weeks! Cannot wait to see what it does in the next four weeks!”\nSee results in as little as three to four weeks with this handheld-sized option. Equipped with five power settings, this device is safe to go all over various skin tones and sensitive areas (yep, even down there!) easily. Uniquely, the head of the device offers cooling properties to reduce laser heat on the skin. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light blonde hair\nKENZZI rating: 5/5 stars\nA KENZZI reviewer says: “A worthwhile investment; it works! After five sessions, I am seeing notable results. Hair growth is very, very minimal. Absolutely fantastic.”\nThis sapphire device might look too pretty to use, but trust me, you’ll become obsessed with the results. Unlike some devices which can burn the skin, this tool has a significantly cooler head, making it more comfortable to use. If you don’t have a high pain tolerance, this tool is practically painless to use.\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I never write reviews, but feel like I have to for this device. I began using it immediately on my upper lip, chin, and armpits. I have not had to pluck a single chin hair since I started using it over a month ago. The armpit hair growth has substantially decreased as well. I am approximately seven sessions in, and I cannot speak highly enough of this device.”\nThis FDA-approved laser also includes Braun’s smart skin sensor, which automatically adapts your treatment to your skin tone to ensure a safe and effective treatment. Equipped with 300,000 flashes for longevity, the device is small enough for trickier areas (and is safe for facial use!) while covering enough skin so the process doesn’t take forever.\nBest for: Fair to dark complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 4.3/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve been using this about twice a week for a little over a month, and I would say the hair in my pits is 80 to 90 percent gone. And most impressively, it doesn’t hurt!”\nThis compact, lightweight, FDA-approved device is the most time-efficient option out there. The device itself is corded, so keep that in mind. However, as its title suggests, you simply press the button where you want to laser for a quick treatment. Plus, it’s safe to use on your face!\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Yes, this really works. I have very light skin with dark hair. I started using this every three days and my bikini line and upper lip hairs are now pretty much non-existent.”\nIf you’re looking for an FDA-approved device to treat larger areas like your legs, arms, or back, the head of this laser is large enough to cover more ground. The laser emitted is a brand-patented combination of IPL and radiofrequency designed to safely treat a broader range of skin tones and hair colors. The scientists behind the professional machines actually developed the technology, so you know you’re in good hands.\nBest for: All skin tones\nHair color: All hair colors\nNordstrom rating: 4/5 stars\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “I️ had modest expectations, but this product definitely went above and beyond. I️ have black hair and mainly used it to reduce the peach fuzz on my abdominal area.”\nIf you’re in the market for something that won’t break the bank but will still get those silky hair-free legs you’ve been dreaming about, look no further. This model features two modes and eight adjustable light settings to ensure pain-free removal. Even better, you get a three-year warranty. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Light brown to black hair\nAmazon rating: 3.6/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “I didn’t really expect this little device to do such a good job, but it does. I would normally need to shave every three days, and now I don’t have stubble for nearly a week. Plus, my skin feels really smooth.”\nFor your next international getaway or domestic weekend trip, you might want to start thinking about what you want to bring in your makeup bag. This FDA-approved device can easily fit in any toiletry case and still packs a punch with its 300,000 flashes. In fact, it’s designed to reveal smooth skin in just 15 minutes. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.1/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “Quite simple to use, doesn’t burn, and isn’t painful. It is small and can be carried in your luggage, so you do not have to stop the treatments.”\nIf your pain tolerance is somewhat low, you may want to reach for this device with cooling technology that reduces laser heat and inflammation. What’s more, it has three other attachments and is rechargeable. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “It worked like magic. You need to be consistent though, but it works.”\nIt’s no secret that laser hair removal can be uncomfortable at times. Here's an option that is borderline pain-free. The laser on this machine feels more like an ice cube to the skin, which helps minimize pain and soothe the skin. It’s got two modes for large and small areas and five energy levels to adapt to different hair densities and skin sensitivities. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.6/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “I was so surprised this actually worked, but it did! The hair I treated has either grown back more slowly and is sparse or hasn’t come back at all. I’ve used it every other week for the past three months. More than got my money’s worth.”\nUnlike many at-home IPL devices, this one is suitable for several skin types and hair colors, and, according to reviewers, it’s also a gentler option than many others on the market. The device itself isn’t rechargeable or corded; it comes pre-charged with 400,000 light pulses, which the company claims will last a “lifetime.”\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.5/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “This product does work! It may not work as well as the professional treatments, but with patience, the cost benefit and easy access make treating yourself at home well worth it.”\nDr. Marisa K. Garshick is a dermatologist practicing with MCDS Dermatology in New York and New Jersey.\nDr. Karan Lal is a dermatologist and director of pediatric dermatology and cosmetic surgery at Affiliated Dermatology in Scottsdale, Arizona. \n“Both IPL and diode devices rely on the same target, which is the pigment of the hair follicle, to have an effect,” Dr. Garshick says. She adds, “At the most basic level, the diode refers to an actual laser, while the IPL is a light-based device.”With a bit of consistency and a lot of patience whichever light beam route you opt for will come with real results. Typically, it will take at least a few sessions to see any change, and each session should be spaced out at least one week apart. Remember always to follow the instructions of your specific device.\nDepending on the intensity level of the laser (many of the devices have multiple settings), it can feel uncomfortable. When each follicle gets zapped, it might sting a bit—many people compare it to a rubber band being snapped on the skin. But hey, no pain, no gain, right?\nBefore you start shopping (and zapping) away, we do have one important editor’s note: Since laser hair removal relies on melanin to produce results, it’s often not effective on lighter hair colors, like blonde and light gray, which, by nature, contain less pigment. If you have a lighter hair color, consult with a dermatologist before investing your money into an expensive at-home device. Also, read the fine print of every product description because most companies disclose this information upfront. Laser hair removal is also safe for people of color, but certain lasers can cause hyperpigmentation and irritation on darker skin tones, so again, it is best to consult your dermatologist.\nGenerally speaking, laser hair removal devices are safe. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take proper precautions. “At-home laser hair removal can be safe,” says Dr. Lal. However,  he adds, “It is not universally safe because many factors play a role in safety. All available devices are safe for those with light skin and dark hair.” Needless to say, burns and redness can still occur with less powerful at-home devices. Contact a doctor if you are concerned or notice any discomfort or irritation. \nDr. Lal has a few helpful tips to make removal easier and safer: “Be sure to have tiny stubble the laser can pick up for treatment. Make sure the device you are using is suitable for your skin color and hair color. Don’t use this laser if you have red or very light blonde hair. Don’t over-pulse the laser in the same location as this could lead to burns.”\nFor in-office treatments, “The gold standard is the Gentlemax Pro by Candela. It is a dual alexandrite and Nd-Yag laser that can treat all skin types, hairs of various sizes, and in various locations,” says Dr. Lal.\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

{"title": "Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake’s Full Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-03 22:00:00", "text": "Actress Jessica Biel and pop star Justin Timberlake have been married for ten years and together for almost 16, and they're still going strong. The pair have had their ups and downs, including a brief breakup and even briefer photo scandal. But they recently renewed their vows and share two sons, one of whom was born during COVID-19 lockdown. \nHere's the complete timeline of their relationship thus far.\nShortly after his break up with Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are seen snowboarding together with a group of friends in Park City, Utah, and some might say even flirting. Biel had just broken up with baseball star Derek Jeter. A source told People that Timberlake was only “trying to have a good time.”\nThey added, “He is in no way looking to be in a relationship. He's single and he's happy.”\nAnother source says that Timberlake is “in love” with Biel, adding, “He wants to be with her all the time. He's ready to be serious.”\nOn the cover of British GQ, Biel calls her very private relationship with Timberlake her “one sparkly present” that she doesn't “want to open in front of strangers.”\n“It's the one part of my life that is my own and not for anyone else,” she said at the time.\nRumors start circulating that the couple have broken up, but a source said, “They're together...They're not breaking up. Any time they spend time apart it's because they're working.”\nThey did add, “Things have been a bit up in the air recently. They've been spending more time apart—more time with each of their friends, and they've been reevaluating [their relationship].”\nA few years later, things go from assessing to ending. They decided to end their relationship, but a source stated there were “no hard feelings” and it “was completely mutual, and they both decided it was time to move on.”\nReps confirmed the break up, saying, “Addressing the media speculation regarding Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's relationship, we are confirming that they mutually have decided to part ways. The two remain friends and continue to hold the highest level of love and respect for each other.”\nIn the July issue of Vanity Fair, Timberlake is effusive about his ex.\n“She is the single-handedly most significant person in my life,” he says. “In my 30 years, she is the most special person, okay? I don’t want to say much more, because I have to protect things that are dear to me—for instance, her.”\nThe pair were seen in Toronto enjoying time together at an art deco diner on Queen Street West. An eyewitness said, “They were in good spirits....They seemed happy. They had brunch together. They were talking. They enjoyed their food. They had a nice time.”\nA source explained, “They always remained friendly after the split and spent time together.”\nThe break didn't last too long, though. That November, Biel hinted in an interview with ELLE magazine that they may have reconciled after being asked about her dating life.\n“A girl doesn't kiss and tell,” she said. \nA month later, they were engaged. Timberlake proposed to Biel when they visited Montana, which she recounted years later on The Late Late Show.\n“We were in Montana on a piece of property that we owned at the time,” Biel recalled. “We had snowboarded all day. It was in the middle of the winter. Waist-high snow. We were [in] head-to-toe snowboarding outfits—hats, gloves, everything.”\nBiel continued, “And we go up to the property to just check out how the foundation is looking. And all of a sudden, he gets down onto his knees and just sinks into the snow.” \nIn a cover story for InStyle, Biel says Timberlake picked out the ring himself and often helps her style choices.\n“I had no say whatsoever [in the ring]. I don’t micromanage,” she said. “He is fearless in his choices and has a real eye for design. And I’ll be honest: He has better taste than I do.”\nOn October 19, 2012, the couple marry in southern Italy, and like most of their moments, it's quite private.\n“I had a little bit of butterflies,” Biel told People about the ceremony. “I was about to stand up in front of my friends and family and bare my soul for the person I love. It was terribly emotional.” \nTimberlake confirmed Biel's pregnancy on January 31, which was also his 34th birthday. He shared a pic of himself kissing Biel's belly, captioning it, “Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets.”\nTimberlake celebrates Biel's birthday on Instagram. \nIn April, the birth of their baby was confirmed by the couple's publicist to People. The rep added that “mom and baby are doing well and dad is ‘ecstatic.’”\nThe baby boy was named Silas Randall, and his first photo showed him wearing a Memphis Grizzlies shirt. \nBiel shared something about motherhood with E! News, saying her most magical moment with Silas thus far was “probably the moment he wakes up from a nap. He's sort of looking around and you sort of creep up and look over the crib and he looks up and he goes [big sigh] just a gummy mouth, no teeth, just a big smile, happy that you're alive, and you're just looking at him.”\nShe added, “You quickly move on from it because there is a dirty diaper in your palm.”\nBiel told ELLE.com at the Tiffany Blue Book gala that parenthood changed her style.\n“Some days it does feel as though there's no time for anything. Fashion sometimes feels like it goes to the bottom of the list,” she said. “I do feel like I have to make a little bit more of an effort, because it's very easy to just throw on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and sneakers and just run out the door, because you're doing a million things at once.” \nShe continued, “You have to just say: You know what, I'm going to put on my heels, I'm going to put on my dress, and I'm going to do it. You do have to make an effort, I think.”\nWhen asked about Timberlake's style, she replied, “No, nothing's changed for him, he's fine...He always looks great, even when he's sloppy!”\nJessica Biel's 7th Heaven costar Beverley Mitchell told Access Hollywood Live that she was there when they met and sparks flew.\n“I was there like the moment the love connection happened,” said Mitchell. “I was like, ‘Okay, this is happening.’ They met, it was at the Golden Globes. It was so cute because they were like—it's that moment like I like you, I think you like me. It was very, very sweet. They were definitely flirting. They were really cute.” \nThe actress spoke with ELLE.com at the premiere of her TV series The Sinner, saying her character was informed by her son Silas.\n“It's personal for me,” she said. “I wouldn't be able to do this role if I didn't know what it was like to be a mom. If I wouldn't be able to see my son every day...I get emotional just thinking about it.”\nThat same month, she told Marie Claire, “You think you're a selfless person, and then you realize you're not. These little people come around, and they require so much, and your schedule is really not your own, nor is it important anymore, and it's very clear that it's your life now, revolving around this dude. I'm not that person who feels like, Oh, my whole life changes for my kid, but it does.” \nBiel starred in the video for Timberlake's single “Man of the Woods,” being the babe of the song.\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight Timberlake opened up about needing to go on vocal rest, and how Biel helped him cope with the disappointment of canceling shows.\n“I think anybody out there, you know, you go through anything, to have somebody by your side to really go through it with you and get in the mud with you, so to speak, I'm sure you know what that's like,” he said. “It's like once you find that person, it's like a baptism, where you're like, ‘I can't go back,’ you know what I mean? Like, I don't, I can't go back, so, which is what fatherhood's like too.”\nBiel also spoke to Entertainment Tonight, and shared how she knew that Timberlake was the one. \n“I knew that he was my person early on, but we were so young,” she said. “There wasn't any big risks being taken. There wasn't anything... really putting anything on the line. We were just hanging out. I think before we got married, that's when I was like, ‘Oh yeah, this is the person I want to be in the boat with when we hit the rapids, because we're going to hit the rapids and we're going to have to hold on tight. Can you row? Because I can row, I think you can row, let's try this.’”\nBiel added, “It was like that early on in our relationship and when you're married for the first time you go, ‘Okay. You can't just jump out of this thing.’”\nIn 2019, pics were leaked of Timberlake holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, and Us Weekly reported that Biel pushed him to apologize publicly.\n“Jessica encouraged Justin to put out his statement on Instagram because she felt embarrassed by his actions and wanted him to take accountability,” a source said. “Jessica was very upset and embarrassed by Justin's behavior. [But] they are still united, very much together and strong.”\nWainwright's rep denied anything happened between them, as did he in his statement. He wrote:\nBefore the couple confirmed it, The Daily Mail reported the couple had welcome a second child. \nA few months later, Timberlake's former *NSYNC colleague Lance Bass told Entertainment Tonight,  “The baby is cute of course; it's Justin and Jessica!”\nWhile he spilled those beans, he did not reveal the baby's name, adding, “Justin would kill me!”\nTimberlake's friend and collaborator, Brian McKnight also confirmed the child's existence in an interview with Hollywood Life.\n“Having kids and having his family, I think [Justin] took some time to focus on those things because those things are very important,” he said. “I think if he’s going to do music, he’s going to make sure that that's secure, and then he'll bring us into his music. And being inspired! He just had a new baby. I think that's going to be really inspiring for him and he'll have some new music based on that, I'm sure.”\nTimberlake confirmed he had a new baby himself while speaking to Ellen DeGeneres on her former talk show, a son named Phineas.\n“He's awesome and so cute. Nobody's sleeping,” Timberlake said. “But we're thrilled. We're thrilled and couldn't be happier. Very grateful.” \nIn June, Biel went on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast, and talked about having a baby during lockdown. \n“I had, like, a secret COVID baby,” she explained. “It wasn't like it was supposed to be a secret. It was just COVID happened, and then I went to Montana with my family and never left.”\nWith the pandemic, the couple spent more and more time in Montana and ended up listing their home in the Hollywood Hills home for $35 million.\n“They're rarely in L.A. and are happy to live in Montana,” a source told People. “They also still have a place on the East Coast.”\nTimberlake posted on Instagram for Biel's 40th birthday, and wrote on his Story, “Whether it's laid up on a couch, kicking my ass at the gym or, dressing up at ridiculous costume parties... you make it all look good. I love you and I celebrate you every day.”\nBiel revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that her husband threw her a huge birthday party for the milestone birthday and covered a bunch of her favorite songs.\n“He's just my favorite....He threw me such an amazing, amazing party. And he flew his band in and he performed for me,” she gushed. “Look, I will go head-to-head with everybody, but I'm his No. 1 fan. And I mean, who do I want to see on my birthday? It's him and his band. He's my favorite.”\nShe added, “Everything from Feist to Radio Head to Donny Hathaway ... it just goes on and on.”\nDuring the premiere of her Hulu series Candy, Biel told Entertainment Tonight why her relationship with Timberlake is going strong ten years later.\n“It's a really good question, right?” she said. “Well, I'll have to give Justin the credit in this moment, for this one thing that he always says to me: ‘We might be married, but we have to keep dating,’ and it's so true. You just have to keep making time for each other and you have to keep making each other a priority. And do the things that you love together.”\n“It's not always easy, as we all know, but those touch point moments make all the hard times palatable,” she added.\nTimberlake even made a cameo in the series as Deputy Steve Deffibaugh, a part he volunteered for after reading the show's script.\n“He said, ‘Oh, who's playing this character?’ I said, ‘Oh, I don't know, probably somebody local. We don't have any money left,’” Biel said. “And he goes, “I want to play it.’”\nThe official anniversary of ten years of marriage was that October, and Timberlake posted,  “10 years ain't enough! You make me a better husband and father every day! I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!”\nBiel shared a carousel of images as well, writing, “Being married to you is the adventure of a lifetime! Run it back, baby. RUN IT BACK. I love you.”\nBiel's post revealed that the couple had a vow renewal ceremony when she reshared it in a Story, writing, “From our wedding vow renewal this summer—in Italy where it all went down.”\nShe went on Today and described the ceremony as “very intimate” with just a “couple of friends.”\n“We almost canceled it,” Biel said. “We thought, ‘This is silly, are we going to feel goofy doing this?’ And actually, it was so moving. I felt like, ‘Wow, we're going to keep doing this. Look at us!’ It felt really nice.”\nShe added  of her marriage, “It feels so, I don't know, a combination of incredibly safe and just deep understanding of another person.”\nBiel celebrated Timberlake's 42nd birthday, writing, “Happy birthday to the person who challenges and inspires me every day. The person who keeps me laughing and creating and risking it all. The person who makes the ordinary extraordinary. You know who you are. I love you.”\nTimberlake fêted Biel's 41st birthday with his own Instagram tribute to her, featuring a carousel of couple pics. “Let me tell y’all about this human… she is the most badass, most graceful, most gorgeous DREAM of a partner I could have ever wished for,” he wrote in his caption. “And today is her bday! I’m so glad you were born, my love. And, I’m so lucky that you are choosing to do this thing called life with me. Aging like a FINE🍷!!!! I love you to the moon and back. —Huz.”\nLater that month, on Thursday, March 23, the pair were at the final night of SZA's SOS Tour in Los Angeles. On his Instagram Stores, Timberlake shared a photo of their tickets to the concert at The Kia Forum, with the words “Date night” over it, even tagging SZA herself. There were also some video shots of them dancing and enjoying themselves during the show.\nPhotos come out of Biel and Timberlake on a vacation in Rome. Activities included exploring the city’s catacombs and going shopping.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Why Jodie Turner-Smith and Joshua Jackson Are Divorcing: They’ve ‘Been Having Issues’", "date": "2023-10-03 22:06:00", "text": "Sources spoke to multiple outlets about what led the couple to split and why Jackson is “heartbroken.”\nJodie Turner-Smith filed for divorce from Joshua Jackson on Monday after nearly four years of marriage. The breakup was unexpected, given that the couple was recently photographed together during New York Fashion Week. However, sources have made it clear to Us Weekly, Entertainment Tonight and Daily Mail that, privately, it’s been on the horizon for some time on Turner-Smith’s end.\n“Jodie and Joshua have been having issues lately,” a source told Entertainment Tonight. “They celebrated Jodie’s birthday on September 9 at The Flower Shop in NYC but arrived separately and left separately. It was a big party, and they were distant throughout the night and barely around each other. Jodie spent majority of the evening downstairs.”\nWork was also a factor, a separate source told Entertainment Tonight. “Jodie and Joshua’s hectic work schedules started to weigh on their relationship starting over a year ago when they were both filming projects and not always in the same place,” that source said. “They tried to make things work and were taking steps to help their relationship and deal with managing their busy schedules. From an outside perspective, things looked great for a while, but privately, they were slowly growing apart.”\n“They are trying to be amicable as they move forward with their divorce and trying to avoid any feelings of animosity,” the source continued. “They’re both respectful of each other and focused on co-parenting their daughter. They want to have a positive relationship for her sake and for themselves.”\nAnother source gave Daily Mail much more detail about Jackson’s feelings regarding the split. He didn’t want it, that insider claimed, but the couple just didn’t work romantically anymore and are better as co-parents to their three-year-old daughter.\n“Joshua is heartbroken over the impending divorce. He always thought that he would be married and grow old with his family, and everything would be happily ever after,” the source said. “He had the dream scenario in his mind, and Jodie was his person and the person he thought he would be with forever.” \nJackson would reconcile, the source claimed: “He would have loved nothing more than to still be with Jodie and in a perfect world would probably even take her back if she were to stop the divorce, but now that they have got to this place, he is going to have to accept it.”\nThat source said no “bad behavior” caused the split: “Nothing horrible happened between the two like infidelity, the relationship just went its course, and it is just a sad time.”\nA source gave similar intel to Us Weekly later on October 3. “Joshua was clearly caught off guard by Jodie’s decision to divorce,” the source said. “They had their issues, as many couples do—especially two busy actors who are also juggling a child. Joshua obviously didn’t realize it was this bad, that Jodie was this unhappy.”\nTheir friends don’t see their “whirlwind romance” as being what caused the split as much as just lifestyle changes. “They became glued to each other after the first night they met, and then parenthood soon followed,” the source said. “It was a huge lifestyle change, especially for a free spirit like Jodie. But they seemed so devoted to each other, so everyone is shaking their heads.”\nWhile their friends hope they reconcile, the source said Turner-Smith “seems quite sure of her decision. The ball is in Joshua’s court, though right now he’s likely trying to sort things out himself.”\nTurner-Smith listed “irreconcilable differences” as their cause of divorce and their date of separation as September 13, right after their fashion week appearances. Neither she, Jackson, nor their reps have commented on the news.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "The Most Exciting Fall Beauty Products You Need Now", "date": "2023-10-03 22:12:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nELLE's favorite beauty releases of the new season, featuring all sorts of metals. \nRecently, I’ve been getting asked the same questions anytime I'm at a dinner party. The first, what do I think of Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner? The second is more in reference to my job: What beauty products have I seen recently that have really excited me? Well, let me direct them here: To a selection of new Fall beauty launches that are making me feel like it's back-to-school season all over again, and they all happen to have a glint of metals, whether it be in the packaging or the formula itself. Read on for the sparkle explosion coming from Rabanne Beauty, two beautiful new palettes inspired by art, and a royal scent with actual 24-karat-gold.\n“Chanel’s famous skin care line now comes in refillable packaging, with a gold-anodized aluminum core. The refill vessel is also pretty enough to stand on its own (and great for travel).”— Kathleen Hou, Beauty Director\n“This gua sha massage tool is shaped like the fan-shaped leaves of the ginkgo, one of nature’s most mystical trees. I like using the smooth end for lifting, and the curved end for de-puffing, especially when I use it with the Supremÿa Baume, newly reformulated to be even more luxurious and potent.”— K.H.\n“Anybody who loves a head massage needs this comb. Its eight teeth gently stimulate your scalp for better circulation (which may lead to stronger hair growth). It’s made of kansa, a sacred Ayurvedic material that’s naturally antimicrobial.”— Margaux Anbouba, Beauty Editor\nRabanne Beauty leans hard into the ’60s metallic heritage of the fashion brand, with glitter in all-new, extra-shiny forms: glitter spray that makes you look like you were doused with pixie dust; a concentrated loose powder that turns metallic and can be dabbed everywhere; and even a sparkly mascara topcoat. For something a little more subtle, there are eye shadow palettes in rich shades and extra-smooth formulas and an inky black mascara. — K.H.\n“This concealer has medium coverage and a silky formula that’s spiked with hyaluronic acid to hydrate. It lasts all day, so you can look fresh from your morning coffee to evening cleanser.”— M.A.\n“Yes, those are flecks of 24-karat gold inside this fragrance. Inspired by Louis XIV’s beloved orange trees in his parterre garden, fresh neroli blossoms mix with firewood smoke and pomegranate, paying homage to the lively parties that the Sun King threw inside his Orangery.”— M.A.\n“My favorite smoky eye becomes much more artful when using this palette. Each of the shades was inspired by Lancôme makeup creative director Lisa Eldridge’s private tour of the Louvre, where she saw light dancing across the marble statues and artwork of the Richelieu wing.”— M.A.\n“Dior’s new serum has a dramatic backstory: On one day, for just one hour, a special variety of wild rose bred specifically for skin care is harvested, frozen at below-zero temperatures, and then cryo-ground to become the hero ingredient.”— K.H.\n“A new-ish Australian beauty brand committed to ‘slow beauty,’ Fluff does small-batch quarterly drops of its products, which have included a bronzer powder and a solid lip oil. I particularly like the Anish Kapoor–style design of Fluff’s refillable compacts.”— K.H.\nComing Soon\n\"If you’ve always been a vanilla girl and grew up on the scent of Bath & Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar, there’s a grown-up version for you. This scent features a trio of vanillas, including a vanilla infusion, a vanilla absolute, and a vanilla caviar. If you’re looking for a scent like straight vanilla extract, this isn’t it because it doesn’t smell overpoweringly sweet, thanks to some lavendar and woods notes. But it does smell warm and a little edible all at the same time.\"— K.H.\n\"Jean-Claude Ellena, the former master perfume for  Hermès is famous for saying that perfumes should be like a \"soft caress,\" and should not shout. His latest creation isn't any less distinctive though, and is for those who love warm, spicy scents. Fall often means that people begin rotating in their favorite smoky scents. But if you're not a fan of the woodsy scent family, this, with its notes of clove, ambrette, and carrot seed, is a great alternative \"sweater scent.\"  — K.H.\n“With my sensitive dry skin, this is just what I needed. The gel-cream formula melts into to the skin to revive and rehydrate for a smooth, dewy finish. The cream also offers an incredible sounding 100-hours of moisture as a claim, so I'm thinking that it should last me all day.” —Tasha Nicole Smith, Beauty Assistant\n“Gabriela Hearst has released her very first perfume set, created with Argentinian fragrance brand Fueguia. The scent Paysandú features native ingredients never before used in perfumery, such as the medicinal plant marcela and herb carqueja, to conjure up a floral and smoky picture of rural Uruguay, where Hearst and Fueguia founder Julian Bedel both grew up.”— K.H.\n“Gabriela Heart's New York is a ‘big city’ scent, with notes of smoke and bourbon. Together, with Paysandú, they create an aromatic synergy for the designer, who still runs her family’s ranch in Uruguay.”— K.H.\n“After interviewing multiple perfumers, I’ve learned that the key to smelling completely unique is to layer fragrances. It’s sort of like it is with clothes. Wearing an outfit straight off the runway is one thing, but combining a few of your well-loved pieces to create your own distinctive look really makes it personal.  Designer Tory Burch agrees, telling me that, 'Growing up, I always loved mixing and layering scents to create something new.'

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAnd we already know whose death will be at the center of it.\nSpoilers below. \nIt is a shock people are still living in the Arconia considering how many deaths it has seen in the past few years. The building could easily be repurposed as a haunted house or a Spirit Halloween by now. But this is New York, and tenants here know how to suck it up through the worst conditions for a good deal. So that must be the only explanation: The Arconia rent must be so cheap (and stabilized!) for the residents to stay put season after season—including this next one. \nWith a fourth season of Only Murders in the Building on the way, yet another murder has taken place in Charles, Mable, and Oliver’s Upper West Side apartment complex. Here’s what we know. \nYes! Hulu announced the renewal on October 3, the morning of the season 3 finale. “The trio's journey is far from over,” the series announced on social media. \nOnly Murders in the Building is returning for Season 4! The trio's journey is far from over. #OMITB pic.twitter.com/Xv2BxdCWfR\nGoing off of Hulu’s announcement, our lead trio is set to return: Steve Martin (Charles), Martin Short (Oliver), and Selena Gomez (Mabel). \nHowever, the rest of the cast is still unconfirmed. It’s likely we’ll see some favorites, like Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Detective Williams), Michael Cyril Creighton (Howard), Ryan Broussard (Will Putnam), Tina Fey (Cinda Canning), Jackie Hoffman (Uma), Jason Veasey (Jonathan). \nWe’d love to see this past season’s guest stars, like Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd, and even Matthew Broderick, return for more, but that’s also still unclear. \nThe season 3 finale sets up the next whodunnit: At the opening night celebration of Oliver’s musical, Charles’ body double Sazz Pataki (Jane Lynch) swings by Charles’ apartment to pick up another bottle of wine when they run low on booze. However, upon arrival, she is seemingly shot through the window. (A close-up shows a bullet hole through the glass.) Sazz falls to the ground bleeding and dies in Charles’ kitchen. In season 4, the group will surely have to solve not only who killed Sazz, but also whether Charles was the real target and why. \nThere could be some development for the characters’ personal lives too. Mabel and Oliver’s love interests, Tobert and Loretta, move to L.A. for work with the chance of them going long distance. Partners don’t stay for long on Only Murders, but we won’t rule out the possible return of these two (plus Charles’ ex-fiancée Joy) in season 4. \nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

She isn’t afraid to be seen with the people she cares about, be it Kelce or her friends, including Sophie Turner.\nFollowing her March breakup from Alwyn, “Taylor has decided she’s not going to hide anymore,” a source told Us. “She’s going to be her authentic self and enjoy life.”\nKelce and Swift “talk every day,” the source continued. “Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis. They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”\nKelce feels similarly about Swift, a second source said: “Travis is completely smitten.”\nA third source said Swift has decided to live her life far more openly in general.\n“Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back,” that source said. “If something feels right—like it does with Travis—she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”\nA fourth source added, “Following her heart comes naturally to Taylor, and she doesn’t think about the consequences or the optics of [cheering him on]. She’s doing what she wants to do, and it’s a breath of fresh air all around.”\nAlwyn, by contrast, was not a fan of the spotlight. A source told People in April, “Joe has struggled with Taylor's level of fame and the attention from the public. The differences in their personalities have also become harder to ignore after years together. They’ve grown apart.

The outing marks the first time Rihanna has been photographed out since giving birth to the couple’s second son, Riot, on August 1.\nIt is also a prime example of Rihanna’s sexy dinner date dressing. The singer paired a tulle black top with a cropped black jacket and leggings. She wore her hair up and accessorized with big silver hoop earrings, a choker, and sunglasses.\nFew details have come out about Rihanna since she and Rocky welcomed their second child. The couple has managed to spend the first couple weeks away from the limelight for the most part.\nIn mid-September, Rihanna and Rocky chose to share the first photos of Riot, along with the first images of him with 1-year-old big brother RZA.\nA source told Entertainment Tonight when the couple released their family-of-four photos that Rihanna and Rocky are very hands-on parents. “They’ve got their hands full,” the source said. “RZA loves being a big brother. And Ri and A$AP make a point to still spend special one-on-one time with him.”\nImmediately following Riot’s birth, a source told Entertainment Tonight that Rihanna and Rocky had “no immediate plans” to show their new son to the world and planned to stay “out of the public eye.”\nAs a couple, they were doing wonderfully though. The source said, “Rihanna and A$AP are great right now. They’re so excited to grow their family and are so united when it comes to parenting. They have so much fun together and are very in love.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe Rock Star Collection was inspired by Elton John.\n“Christmas is my favorite time of year,” Charlotte Tilbury, founder of her eponymous makeup and skincare line, reveals. During this time, the beautypreneur gifts “trinkets, treasures, and treats” to her friends and industry colleagues, which is a stocking full of personalized products from her “secret, magic, innovation lab.” And while you may not be one of her celebrity friends, she’s launched a dazzling holiday collection, “Charlotte’s Magic Gifting Universe,” where you can step into beauty magic and spread the love and give the gift of glow. However, the standout stars in the holiday extravaganza are none other than Kate Moss, who transforms into a ‘Rocket Girl’ via the inspiration of Elton John (yes, you read that right).\nThe two stars shine in the campaign, with Moss showing off her dynamic modeling skills as she bounces between posing seductively for the camera and an energetic, party girl aura with glittery eyes as Elton John joyfully plays on the piano. “I love the rocket girl look Sofia Tilbury created for me for this campaign. It’s the most gorgeous, hypnotizing, party look that takes you anywhere,” she shares exclusively with ELLE.com.  \nThe Rocket Collection features two new Rock Lips Lipsticks and the Rock Star Bag. The lipsticks shades include Rocket Girl, a cool nudey-pink slightly reminiscent of the cult loved Pillow Talk shade and Ready for Lust, a deep berry red, perfect for the holidays. And while Moss may be the face of the campaign, she’s been a longtime supporter of both Tilbury and her brand. “I’ve worked with her since I was like 20 and created Nude Kate lipstick and was using all my products before I even officially created the brand,” Tilbury shares. The self-contouring formula for Rock Lips hugs your lips perfectly and leaves what Tilbury calls, “a glam rock shimmer.” \nThe collection is defined by stars on the packaging and the makeup bag (that can also double as a going out bag) was a way to bring Elton John’s iconic stage outfits to consumers. “He’s so known for his outfits and his costumes and clothing. The bag gives that Elton John glam rock—that 70s cool rock,” Tilbury says. And while the collection is great, the gift and spirit of giving, is truly what’s behind this collaboration. Tilbury made a personal contribution to The Rocket Fund, which will support The Elton John AIDS Foundation in helping over 40,000 young people at risk of HIV and AIDS to access life-saving services and support. “We have the tools to end HIV and AIDS—it’s the stigma that’s holding us back and I can’t thank Charlote enough for using her holiday campaign to shine light on The Rocket Fund. Together we can end AIDS forever,” John exclusively shares with ELLE.com. \nOutside of The Rocket Collection, the holiday collection includes a limited edition 12-piece advent calendar and her Beautyverse palette, which Moss says is “honestly every trend in a palette.” The palette features a lilac chrome shadow, a silver shadow, neutrals, including browns and pinks, and just the right amount of shimmer. \n“What I love about Charlotte is she is always starting and creating trends,” says Moss, who is a huge fan of the Beautyverse palette. “I’m obsessed with how the cyber silver shade plays with the light to give that cool-girl effect at the same time as giving me bigger, brighter eyes. It’s the perfect combination of vintage and modern.” \nIf you’re looking for the perfect gift for the rockstar in your life (or living out your best on stage dreams), this is the collection for you.

{"title": "Kate Middleton Reportedly ‘Has No Desire’ to Talk to Meghan Markle or Prince Harry", "date": "2023-10-04 18:07:00", "text": "A source detailed why the Sussexes and Waleses aren’t about to make amends.\nThe estranged relationship between the former royal Fab Four—Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Kate Middleton, and Prince William—isn’t about to be fixed any time soon, Us Weekly reports. In fact, a source said Kate is less open than William is to reconciling with Harry and Meghan at this point. \n“Kate has no desire to communicate with Harry nor Meghan,” the source explained. “There has been too much that has happened, and she’s not ready yet.”\nWilliam, meanwhile, is more concerned about his relationship with his younger brother. “William wants his relationship with his brother to improve, but they’re not speaking right now,” the source continued. “So when that will happen is still uncertain.”\nAs for Kate and William’s own relationship? The source said it hasn’t been all that rosy. “Kate and William have been having ups and downs in their marriage like everyone else,” the source said. “But they’re focused on their royal duties and doing that as a unit.”\nKate’s disinterest in engaging with Harry and Meghan doesn’t come as a huge surprise, at least in regards to Meghan. The two royal wives have never been close. In April, a source said Kate was “relieved” Meghan was not attending King Charles’ coronation.\nHarry also wrote in his memoir, Spare, that Kate felt uneasy about Meghan from the start of their relationship. During their first royal event together, Harry wrote that Kate was likely “on edge,” understanding that she was now “going to be compared to, and forced to compete with, Meg.”\nBefore that, royal reporters Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand wrote in their Meghan and Harry biography, Finding Freedom, that as Meghan settled into the royal family, things between her and Kate did not improve.\n“Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends,” the authors wrote then, noting that Kate and Meghan weren’t feuding either. “Their relationship hadn’t progressed much since she was Harry’s girlfriend.” \nThey reported that Kate felt she and Meghan had little in common other than their connection to the royal family. As such, the now Princess of Wales didn’t really make a deep effort to become close to Meghan.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "24 Fashion Trends From the 2000s That Aged Surprisingly Well", "date": "2023-10-04 18:24:00", "text": "How celebs stayed on trend then versus now, plus where to shop modern versions of your favorite styles. \nGrowing up in the early aughts was such a wild time. Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, and boy bands like NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys filled our Hip Klips. The coolest Bratz dolls were dressed in the most iconic 2000s fashion trends, inspiring us to unlock our inner rock stars and our passion for clothes.  Chunky platforms of any style were magic, and mini bags for Tamagotchi toys were necessary. To top it off, the combination of low-rise bottoms or baggy, wide-leg jeans and an off-the-shoulder top was a must. \nWe often lose sight of what was once trendy. But, after some time, it often comes back in style with a brand-new take. Right now, the 2000s are proving to once again shine, as seen on all the today’s most fashion-forward celebs. For those of you who want in on the fun, we dug the best early aughts trends from what may feel like a time capsule—but fret not, they’re just as fashionable today as they were back then. Shop them all below.\nAt this point, it’s hard to go wrong when it comes to sunglasses. Big frames are back en vogue, as are teeny tiny lenses. Dark, light, colored, bedazzled, heart-shaped, reflective, futuristic, funky—nothing is out of bounds. Revel in it with a semi-clear pair adorned with gems, because why not?  \nIf you ask us, it was unjust for cargo pants to ever go out of style. Literally everyone loves pockets, and the more the merrier. While in the early aughts, you might have rocked cargos à la Avril Lavigne with sweatbands and skater shoes, modernized silhouettes such as cropped tops and fitted bodysuits help give the style a contemporary twist.  \nGrowing up, we all had our favorite pair of ballet flats—sparkly, classic, or doll-like (or maybe all of the above). This season, these flats are back to elevate our outfits and perhaps keep us off our toes. We may not be wearing them like Ashley Tisdale anymore, but let’s be real, who doesn’t wanna feel like a ballerina?\nThere’s a Goldilocks metric to be used when it comes to purses. Some are way too big, others way too small, both of which we had way too many, stuffed into the nooks and crannies of our closets. But a small-to-medium baguette that fits perfectly under your shoulder? Just right.  \nVelveteen tracksuits were a truly unexplainable phenomenon of the 2000s. Everyone seemed to know how absurd they were, yet they blew up in popularity regardless. The sight of one still harkens back to the Mean Girls era. The resurgence of the monochromatic tracksuit in recent years is a testament to the status symbol that Juicy Couture remains. And honestly, respect to Juicy for having that kind of staying power.  \nDivisive, we know, but there’s enough room at this party for all varieties of waistlines. While we’re not sure we’ll ever fully integrate back to the lower-belly baring cuts of the early aughts, it certainly is a fun style to mix into your wardrobe every now and then.  \nThis comeback is a personal favorite. Flaunting shirts emblazoned with “MILF in training” or “I’m a Virgin! (But this is an old T-shirt),” Britney Spears was the bona fide queen of snarky tanks and baby tees. In more recent history, Gigi Hadid rocked a “lol ur not zayn malik” shirt in reference to her at-the-time beau, and wild child Cara Delevingne sported one that read, “Twerking is not a crime.” \nObviously, these hair accessories have never really gone out of style, but they’re having a moment right now, nonetheless. Whether you opt for a larger, more artisan adornment or go for the traditional small plastic butterfly clips, these are simple ways to add flair to any outfit. \nCamouflage has been in for decades and continues to make us pretend we’re incognito (if only, right?). In the 2020s, we believe camo is best paired with a kitten heel and a tube top.  Or, turn those baggy pants into a stunning streetwear vibe with a great pair of sneakers and an oversized jacket.  \nKind of a random trend, no? Still, the mesh paneling of a trucker hat is incredibly reminiscent of the early aughts. Top off your pink highlights with a Von Dutch hat, throw on some DC skater shoes, charge up your Sidekick, and you’re ready for a baller night with your peeps.  \nAdmittedly, the 2000s were a pretty toxic time for women’s beauty standards. Point blank. Let’s not regress in that direction. But! One redeeming quality of the decade was that stylish women often experimented with menswear or menswear-inspired looks. Case in point: vests. Today, wear one with matching suit pieces or on its own.  \nWhile waist beads are far more than a trend for many cultures (namely, West African ones), they have come and gone from the popular zeitgeist throughout the years. They’re back, obviously, or else they wouldn’t have a spot on this list.  \nIn the same vein as vests, neckties are another garment traditionally associated with menswear that ladies of the 2000s made their own. All we have to say about ties is this: Don’t knock it ’til you try it. They’re surprisingly flattering and have the potential to be oh-so-chic. \nHold for applause. Yes, mini skirts! They’re everybody’s favorite. As Shania Twain so poetically sang in “Man! I Feel Like A Woman,” there really is something about a short skirt that feels simply feminine in all the best ways. All leg and sex appeal.  \nWe never thought we’d see the day when UGGs looked appropriate for New York Fashion Week, but I guess that’s what I get for underestimating Elsa Hosk. There’s no denying that the UGG brand practically owned the 2000s. The way these boots and slippers had a grip on American youth... \nRhinestones, gems, sequins—all that glitters is sartorial gold. Cross your fingers and hope your mother didn’t toss your bedazzler in the giveaway pile because this trend is alive and well, my friends. \nYou may have called them gauchos or even high-waters. Essentially, they’re wide-legged capris. Post-aughts, sporting a pair probably would have been considered less than fashionable, but not anymore. A flowing pant that hits mid-calf is now considered whimsical and cool.\nWhen I think of cowl necks, I think of the ladies of Sex and the City. As a show that started just before the turn of the millennium and ended in 20004, it’s is invariably linked to the fashions of the early 2000s. Like...wildly so. If you’re looking for a sign of the times, you know what to stream. \nAlmost Famous has sprung up our inner Penny Lanes, and we are ready to make a statement. Fall is here, so why not stay warm while looking as chic as miss Olivia Rodrigo, who has literally poured her GUTS into the 2000s? You already know her tour will be filled with the best Y2K pieces.\nIt’s giving manic pixie dream girl; it’s giving Amanda Bynes in What A Girl Wants; it’s giving leftover Chinese takeout in the fridge because she’s quirky. Slip skirts are the key to channeling your inner chaotic cool girl.  \nAny trend that hinges on multi-use items or DIY-ing is sure to be a winner. A top that’s also a scarf, hair wrap, belt, bag accessory, and sarong? Say no more. We hereby declare that scarf/tube/handkerchief/halter tops shall never go out of style.  \nIf you look up “bandage dress” in the dictionary, you’ll find a picture of Serena van der Woodsen in a Hervé Leger dress. Okay, not really, but you might as well. These dresses and skirts were everywhere—and I can’t stress this enough: everywhere—in the late 2000s. It appears their time has come again, as Herve Leger and Law Roach recently collaborated on a resort 2023 collection.   \nBefore there was Barbiecore, there was just plain pink. We could try to make up a name for when it trended back in the day, but let’s just call it like it is. Pink is all-powerful. Pink is everywhere, everything, all at once. Pink is then, now, and forever.  \nBecause why wouldn’t you want to look like you just left the boardwalk with a sweet personalized hoodie?  \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe latest cool-girl accoutrement is fresh off the field: the high-fashion sports jersey. \nStyle Points is a weekly column about how fashion intersects with the wider world.\nPop culture feels a lot like high school homecoming these days, especially with Taylor Swift turning two Kansas City Chiefs games into celebrity moments (and fashion moments, complete with a cherry-red team jacket). Not to mention helping drive a nearly 400 percent spike in Travis Kelce jersey sales. And fashion isn’t far behind, with sports jerseys proliferating on both the runways and the street style runways outside of them. \nWhy is the jersey everywhere these days? Perhaps it’s because standard athleisure has started to feel a little stale, leaving room for fashion to pass the spirit stick to actual sportswear. You can also credit the growing fashion footprint of everything from soccer to Formula 1 racing, the fashion-ification of pastimes from tennis to golf and skiing, or our collective anticipation for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Throwing on a jersey has never been more au courant, not to mention a way to signal that you’re in the know. And like a suit with sneakers, or a blazer with a sports bra, it adds some jock inspiration to a look without tipping into full tailgate territory. \nKim Kardashian has been spotted in soccer jerseys that are equal parts blokecore and Europecore, including a ’90s A.S. Roma uniform and a Paris-Saint Germain style from the 2000s, both of which reportedly caused spikes in interest for the styles. Addison Rae has repped Brazil’s soccer team in bright yellow silk, while Hailey Bieber recently wore an oversized Dime jersey as a dress. For a recent Dolphins game, Alix Earle cut the front of her jersey in half, spurring countless TikTok imitators to do the same. Julia Fox has sported a Yankees shirt and a sheer jersey from Willy Chavarria emblazoned with the word “CATECHISM” (and paired, naturally, with matching pants that say “SPORTS”). And, of course, Rihanna has been a longtime practitioner of the high-fashion jersey look, wearing a variety of takes over the years.\nThe NFL announcers presuming that Swift and her fan base might not know the rules of the game would do well to realize that there are plenty of young female fans out there, (including Swift herself, who’s rocked her Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt before).\nAnd those fans seemingly included New York Fashion Week attendees, who paired their team colors with more high-end pieces and accessories for a look that says sure, I’m a fashion person, but I don’t take myself too seriously. Koché, Martine Rose, and Off-White were among the designers incorporating jerseys into their shows for spring 2024. And not far afield from their runways, at Paris’ Musée Des arts Décoratifs, you can see the ultimate grail on view as part of the exhibit “Mode et Sport”: Zinedine Zidane’s game-winning jersey, immortalized in a glass frame. \nVéronique Hyland is ELLE’s Fashion Features Director and the author of the book Dress Code, which was selected as one of The New Yorker's Best Books of the Year.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nSelena Gomez is doing great, but it was a journey to get there. Gomez spoke to Vogue and People recently about how she feels at 31 after navigating her bipolar diagnosis in 2018, physical and mental health struggles, and of course, fame throughout her childhood, teens, and 20s. \nGomez has been giving interviews this week following news that on October 10, Sephora will be donating 100 percent of all Rare Beauty sales to her makeup brand’s Rare Impact Fund, which supports mental heath organizations. \nGomez told People that she is a fan of her 30s. “I have to say, turning 30 was a good moment for me. I’m 31 now, and I actually truly feel like the older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve really appreciated the struggles that I’ve had,” she said. “And I don’t necessarily feel like I’m held back by anything. I just feel like I’ve been honest with the world, I’ve been honest with myself, I’ve called myself out, and I just want to be the best version of myself.”\nIt took time for Gomez to get to the good headspace she is in now. “I know it seems easy [to look confident], but I promise you it’s been years of constant back and forth in my head, and now I’m just really happy, and I guess it’s showing, which I’m really honored.”\nGomez shared similar comments to Vogue, saying, “I don’t feel good all the time.” But spending time with her 10-year-old sister Gracie Elliott does help: “She reminds me of a perspective in life that can be a bit simpler and pure. Even just having a moment with her makes me feel better.”\nWith friends and new people in her life, Gomez is more discerning now too: “I can gauge the difference between someone who wants to actually get to know me versus someone who just wants to know me as a person. I’m grateful that I can tell.”\nShop Rare Beauty products on Sephora here on October 10.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater Are Reportedly Living Together ‘Full-Time’ in NYC", "date": "2023-10-04 19:24:00", "text": "Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s relationship has become more serious. Nearly one month after Daily Mail first reported that Grande and Slater were living together, a source told Us Weekly that it’s true. \n“Ethan informed his friends and soon-to-be ex-wife [Lilly Jay] that he’s living with Ariana full-time in New York,” the source said. “They’re really happy and really good for each other. All of her friends love him.” That source didn’t specify when the private couple moved in.\nIn Daily Mail’s initial September 12 report, a source close to the situation claimed: “Ariana is living with a married man right now while she is still married [to Dalton Gomez, from whom Grande filed for divorce on September 18]. It seems as if Ariana is holding onto Dalton in case things with Ethan don’t work. It is just so strange that she is living with Ethan and has not filed documents to end it with Dalton.”\nGomez filed for divorce immediately after Grande on the 18th. Sources told TMZ that Grande and Gomez worked everything out before they filed, and Grande will “cut Dalton a check, and that will be that.”\nGrande and Slater were first seen together in Disney World days later on September 22. They were with family and friends, including Grande’s mom and brother, and had a private tour guide take them around the Orlando theme park.\nNeither Grande nor Slater have commented on their romance or posted about it on their social media. The couple met while working on the movie musical Wicked and were friends before they dated.\nBoth are currently in the process of divorcing their previous partners, Jay and Gomez. Sources stressed that they did not start seeing each other romantically until after they were separated from their spouses. \nA source additionally told People in early September, “They are doing their best to balance the fact that they are in the public eye with the desire to be respectful to all parties involved.”\nJay is the only one of the four to say anything publicly. She told Page Six in late July: “[Ariana’s] the story really. Not a girl’s girl.

{"title": "Ariana DeBose Lived Her French Fantasy at Paris Fashion Week", "date": "2023-10-04 20:07:00", "text": "Paris may conjure up images of the Eiffel Tower, people-watching at cafés, and no-holds-barred shopping sprees on the Champs-Élysées. For Ariana DeBose, leaning into her French fantasy means waking up early and “wandering around a bit aimlessly while listening to Édith Piaf.” And that’s exactly what she did before her pre-show prep for Chanel’s spring/summer 2024 show at the Grand Palais Éphémère yesterday.\n“I love that you can basically walk into any restaurant in Paris and have amazing food,” she adds. “Truly. It feels like there’s this incredible standard that comes with French cuisine and yet the environment can feel so casual and full of joie de vivre.” The same can be said of French style. Case in point: DeBose’s look, a color story of gold, black, and maroon—specifically, a hooded shawl, a going-out top layered under a vest, and pants with metallic detail and an elastic waist (ideal for decadent meals).\n“Chanel really came into my consciousness in 2004 with Baz Luhrmann’s No.5 the Film featuring Nicole Kidman. I was 13. I had been fascinated by Moulin Rouge, so that collaboration drew me in and began a love affair with the romanticism that exists across the brand.” Apart from attending the show, largely considered the top billing of Paris Fashion Week, what else is on DeBose’s bucket list in the capital city? “Visiting the salt marshes of Île de Ré, going to Gabrielle Chanel’s apartment on Rue Cambon, and having a martini at Bar Hemingway inside the Ritz. “Ernest was a great writer,” she says. \nBelow, DeBose takes ELLE.com along as she gets ready for Chanel’s spring/summer 2024 show:\nClaire Stern is the Digital Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "Zaya Wade Is Showing the World Who She Is", "date": "2023-10-04 20:46:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nA conversation with Miu Miu’s biggest muse during Paris Fashion Week.\nZaya Wade is finally old enough to get her driver’s license, but she’s been a driving force in the fashion industry for some time now.  The 16-year-old daughter of former NBA player Dwayne Wade and stepdaughter of actress Gabrielle Union has already walked runways, sat front row at fashion week, and posed on red carpets. “I’m having so much fun with fashion,” she tells ELLE.com.  \nSince coming out as transgender in 2020, Wade says she has discovered the special—and uniquely affirming—type of joy that comes with expressing yourself through what you wear. “It’s a way to show the world that all the negativity isn’t going to bring me down,” she explains. “To me, it’s about showing the world and myself that I’m just me. I’m still who I am and who I continue to want to be.” \nAt Paris Fashion Week, Wade took in Miuccia Prada’s highly-anticipated spring 2024 collection wearing the brand’s leather harness biker boots, leather handbag, and a golden faux fur coat. After the show—and before heading out to the Miu Miu dinner party exclusively for editors, celebs, models, and stylists—we caught up with Wade to talk about her foray into fashion.\nELLE: Tell me about getting ready for the Miu Miu show.\nZaya Wade: Well, in all honesty, I was a little nervous. I woke up very early this morning at 5 A.M., and couldn’t go back to bed. But it was the good kind of nervous. Then, I ate some breakfast. Glam came over round 11 A.M. It was really fun. It was low-key, but, you know, we wanted to slay, of course.\nELLE: Of course! What inspired your glam look? \nZW: For the most part, I like to keep it very like clean, just neutral. But today, for the lip, we really wanted to do a lip line and go more bold with it. I wanted to bring some extra spice to the outfit, but there wasn’t a particular or specific inspiration—just the energy that we decided to bring.\nELLE: Let’s talk about the outfit. How did you decide on what to wear? \nZW: So it was very layered, all stuff from the new Miu Miu collection. Well, not the new collection, but you know, from the most recent collection. I had this faux fur coat, it was so chic and very warm. I wore these mid-calf boots. Oh my God, they are to die for. I’m like, can I keep them? \nELLE: I’m manifesting that for you. \nZW: Thanks! Then we filmed a lot of content [for social media], and by 12:30 P.M. we were on our way to the show. It’s been a day, a good day though. \nELLE: You’ve said in the past that fashion is a really important part of expressing yourself and expressing your identity.\nZW: Yes, growing up, my parents were both really, really fashionable. They always went out in some look, and I think that started it for me. It was so inspiring, because I feel like I am able to channel a lot of their energy and personality through clothes. Fashion is one of the most successful ways for me to express myself. I really wanted to get into the fashion world, because I’m not much of a painter. I was like, art is not for me—but what I can do to express myself is wear a great outfit. I decided to get into this world and I’ve been growing and learning and experimenting and trying to express myself every day through my clothing.\nELLE: And what have you learned so far?\nZW: I feel like the biggest thing I’ve learned about the fashion industry so far is that there’s a lot more to it. Every single day I learn something new, but it’s so fun. I think a lot of people have preconceived notions about fashion and modeling, but at least to me it’s really fun. I mean, I get to go to Paris. Like, I’m here in Paris. I feel like everyone’s like, “Oh, modeling, you’re just walking down the runway.” But it’s so much more than that. It’s an entire world. I still have so much to learn.\nELLE: What have you learned about yourself since getting into the fashion industry? \nZW: My confidence has grown. I’ve stepped into myself, especially starting out. I obviously came out as trans, and it was a very confusing time. I didn’t know everything about myself, but having that expression through clothing allowed me to come into my own. It gave me a level of confidence that I have needed and will probably need forever. It gave me the confidence to thrive.\nELLE: Do you think fashion can be used as a tool for communication? \nZW: I always like to say that for me fashion is a form of expression. It’s a way to show the world that all the negativity isn’t going to bring me down. To me, it’s about showing the world and myself that I’m just me. I’m still who I am and who I continue to want to be.\nELLE: And who is that? \nZW: I’m a lot of things. A really big part of me is my love for education and my strive to better the world in different ways. Obviously a big part of my life as a trans person is to be impactful in my community. I continue to take the question of “who am I?” and foster it and grow and, you know, evolve. Every day I ask myself, “Who am I?” And, like, how can I continue to move forward and better answer that question every single day?\nELLE: Speaking of evolvement and growth...in what ways do you think the fashion industry can continue to grow? \nZW: Fashion has grown so much, and we’ve obviously come so far. I would say most notably when it comes to gender fluidity and perceptions of sexuality and all these forms of expression, fashion is heading in the right direction. For too long, there was a very limited stance on what was worn and what was presented. Now, we’re breaking through that barrier and it’s [moving in the right direction]. \nELLE: Which designers do you think are putting in the work to move the needle? \nZW: There’s a world of brands out there doing great things, but Miu Miu really speaks to the image that I’d like to present to the world. Miu Miu is the moment. \nELLE: Miu Miu is definitely the moment. What’s the best piece of fashion advice you’ve gotten?\nZW: It hasn’t been a singular lesson. It’s more about how I carry myself with the clothes that I wear and less about the literal clothes that I wear. Because I think a lot of outfits can be pulled off with just attitude. My stepmom [Gabrielle Union] has given me that conversation about what confidence can do for you and how the clothes that you wear can help you get there. I think about that and embody that every time I put on an outfit. \nELLE: What outfit makes you feel the most like yourself?\nZW: It’s kind of a mix. It really depends on the mood that I’m in, or what I’m feeling. Sometimes I’m here in sweatpants and a baggy sweatshirt and I’m in my bed doing my homework and I’m like, this is me, like, this is who I want to show up as. Other days I am here in Paris wearing Miu Miu, and I’m like, this is who I want to show up as and this is how I’m feeling. I don’t think there’s ever really one answer to what makes me feel most myself.  \nThis conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. \nRose is a Senior Editor at ELLE overseeing features and projects about women's issues.

A source told Us Weekly that Swift “instinctively wanted to reach out” to Turner when she heard news of her and Jonas’ split. \nTurner and Jonas are keeping their daughters in New York City as they work through their child custody case. Swift’s home is now Turner’s for the duration of the process. The singer is “letting Sophie stay there as long as she needs and is supporting her however she can,” the source said.\nIn a separate story, a source told Us Weekly that “Sophie is free to stay at Taylor’s investment property in NY until the custody case with Joe [Jonas] has been finalized.”\nWhile Swift herself dated Jonas for a few months when she was 18, she is very much respecting boundaries now. Her priority is being there for Turner. \n“[She] doesn’t know all the details [of the divorce] because she doesn’t feel like it’s her place,” a source said on September 29. “All she is concerned with is being there to support her friend.”\nTurner and Jonas started mediation today for their custody case; it is slated to continue for four days. A source told People on September 28 that Turner “is doing okay.” The source added, “Taylor has opened her home to Sophie. Sophie is welcome there any time. Taylor continues to be a great friend.”\nWhile Turner hasn’t spoken about her friendship with Swift, the two have been photographed out together frequently.

{"title": "Life as El Chapo’s Wife", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:00", "text": "The real story of Emma Coronel Aispuro.\nEmma Coronel Aispuro looked straight into the camera as the sheriff’s deputy booked her into the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office in Virginia: shadows pooling across her full lips, dark circles ringing her eyes, and her dark hair, parted at the center, falling over her denim blue and green prison shirt. In the mug shot law enforcement dispatched to international media, announcing the capture of El Chapo’s wife, Emma looked as she felt: tired but resolute. \nHer Feb. 22, 2021, arrest was an anniversary of sorts: foreshadowed seven years before on the exact same day when Mexican marines escorted her husband in handcuffs, after having apprehended him in a Mazatlán apartment where they were staying with their twin daughters. Within days of her own arrest, media rumors would swirl that the 31-year-old was cooperating with federal agents. As she sat in her cell, she’d worry about her family back home and what the future might hold for her. Because she had known this day would come. The present had finally caught up to the hypothetical: She, too, was going down for her husband’s crimes.\nThe Casanova Cantina in Culiacán, a city in northwestern Mexico where Emma had moved after marrying one of the world’s most notorious drug lords on her 18th birthday, was packed. Hundreds of young people danced to blaring reggaetón, and the drinks were flowing. Servers carried flaming trays shaped like life-size flamingos and gigantic American Express cards, delivering bottles of champagne and drinks in brightly colored glasses. \nThe cantina was known for attracting buchonas, women with surgically enhanced curves. Tonight, there were murmurs that a niece of Joaquín Guzmán Loera—El Chapo himself, imprisoned for life en el otro lado (in the United States)—was there ahorita mismo. This very moment! Julio César Chávez Jr., the famous Mexican boxer married to the widow of Chapo’s assassinated son, roamed the crowded room.\nNearby, young women were deep in discussion about a hot topic in Culiacán: the impending sentencing of Emma Coronel Aispuro, due in a few days in a courthouse in Washington, D.C. Emma was a celebrity here. El Chapo had plucked her from a beauty pageant some 14 years before, when she was just 17, selecting her as his wife. As the leader of one of the world’s most prolific drug cartels, he could do that. Now, with Emma facing punishment for helping her husband and the cartel, everyone had an opinion.\n“Honestly, I don’t think it’s fair, because she isn’t directly involved,” Karla Castro said in Spanish of Emma’s incarceration. “We have to consider that she’s a mom, and, as his wife, remained silent about what her husband was doing.” \n“I believe that more than anything, she did it for her kids,” added Iskra Burgueño, another patron of the club. She was referring to Emma traveling to the United States earlier that year, where she was almost guaranteed to be arrested.\nThe women shook their heads, wondering aloud whether the brazo largo (“long arm”) of the U.S. government was reaching too far into their country under the guise of protecting American citizens from deadly narcotics.\nTo some, Emma was a victim of the cartel who had no choice but to do what she was told, including breaking the law. To others, she was a victim of overzealous U.S. prosecutors eager to make an example of her, likely knowing she couldn’t cut a deal with the U.S. government without worrying about the worst kinds of consequences from the cartel if she ever returned to her homeland. And to others still, she wasn’t a victim at all, but rather a grown woman who made it rich through her looks and contribution to an international drug syndicate.\n“Once you enter, how do you leave that world?” Castro said, first in Spanish, then in English. “It’s all she knows.”\n“It’s very difficult to leave that,” Burgueño said. “So, I believe that more than anything, she—”\n“She’s scared,” Castro interrupted.\n“I think she’s afraid of losing her family more than anything,” Burgueño said, nodding. \nAfter covering El Chapo’s trial for the New York Times, I traveled twice to Mexico, trying to make sense of his wife—and her life and marriage. Emma was arrested in February 2021 on drug trafficking charges, accused of passing communications between her husband and four of his sons to help her drug-lord husband escape from prison. She even knew of the plan to slip him a GPS device, with her youngest brother helping him escape through a tunnel. She chose to do these things. But considering she is a product of the machismo culture of the cartel, she arguably never had a choice.\nAnd yet, she never claimed victimization. She came from a culture in which women can become the most tragic kind of victim: one who doesn’t know she’s being used at all.\nEmma pleaded guilty to all three counts she was charged with, waiving her right to a trial, and was released from U.S. custody in Los Angeles County on September 13 of this year, after serving about two and a half years. (She will have four years of supervised release.) She did what she did willfully. But does a woman in her situation, married at 18 to a powerful killer three times her age, truly have a will to speak of? \nTucked into the folds of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains and rimmed in verdant green foliage, the town of Canelas glowed honey-lemon in the winter sunlight. A few weeks before the annual festival known as La Feria del Café y la Guayaba, named for the region’s beloved coffee and guava, Emma, then a girl of 17, was campaigning against four other girls to be crowned that year’s reina—the queen of the festival in a town of about 800 people.\nEmma’s was no ordinary family—her father, Inés Coronel Barreras, worked for the Sinaloa cartel, along with some other family members. Although the truth was that while her family was particularly enmeshed, in the area where she grew up, a cartel connection made them more ordinary than unusual.\nAround 20 small planes and helicopters flew in guests for a Three Kings Day dance in honor of Emma’s candidacy. The winding, mountainous streets were crawling with horses, motorcycles, Hummers, and other expensive cars carrying la gente más importante—from prominent traffickers to local politicians, including a member of the Federal Police—into the small pueblo. One plane carried a man whose reputation and deadly reign as a leader of the Sinaloa cartel had made him one of the most wanted men in the world, and years later would prompt the U.S. State Department to offer a bounty of up to $5 million for his capture: Joaquín Guzmán Loera, better known as El Chapo. Another carried Ignacio “Nacho” Coronel Villareal, a powerful cartel leader who oversaw its meth business. \nEmma was dating a local boy from the ranch—her first boyfriend. But she was “very serious, very centered, not much of a dating type,” her cousin, Alfonso López, who lived near Emma’s family for much of their childhood, recalled in a November 2021 WhatsApp interview from his jail cell in the neighboring state of Sinaloa, where he was serving a sentence for illegally importing military weapons.\nEmma knew Chapo the way any teenager might “know” someone famous. She had first caught his eye when they were introduced at a local dance in 2006, and she was aware of his wealth, his flashy, abundant lifestyle, his notoriety among drug lords. (Emma was 11 the first time he broke out of jail, in a laundry cart from one of Mexico’s most secure prisons.) Chapo was also a homeland hero, running a cartel many felt better supported the people and their public safety than the government itself. This was especially true in a town like Canelas, where girls and their families were often anxious for them to marry into financial security and safety. \nChapo—who, according to allegations that he raped girls as young as 13 and called young girls his “vitamins” because they gave him “life”—wanted Emma. As the Three Kings Day dance got underway, he ordered the band to sing one of his favorite songs, “Cruzando Cerros y Arroyos” (“Crossing Hills and Streams”). “You are a flower and you are beautiful,” the singers crooned. “You are a perfumed rose and you were born for me.” When they finished, Chapo ordered it sung again. And again.\nHe and Emma talked for half an hour. Before leaving, Chapo gave Emma’s father a Chevy Cheyenne 4x4 and a Mercedes-Benz topped with a huge bow for Emma. In the mountains, where it’s still customary for families to be paid for their daughter’s hand, a kind of reverse dowry, Emma was now—quite suddenly—the drug lord’s intended wife.\nTwo days later, 150 members of the 72nd Infantry Battalion descended on the area, searching for Chapo, having received intelligence that he was nearby. According to a local paper, over the next several weeks they stood guard over two airstrips and set up checkpoints on the road in between. But the battalion left just days before the feria—in time for Chapo to wend his way back to Canelas, and to Emma’s side.\nA community newspaper article noted that Emma had enjoyed a “great morbid popularity” in the days leading up to the Valentine’s Day election for queen. The competition was steep, Alfonso recalled. Acknowledging the other “very pretty candidates,” he said he suspected Chapo paid people off to vote for her.  \nAmong the honored guests on the day of the election was Chapo, who hired three bands to serenade Emma. Each opened with the same song, one after the other. “Señor Chapo paid a lot of money to make it a grand event,” Alfonso said. That feria was far grander, he believes, than any before or since.\nEmma won the competition with exactly half of the 800 votes and was later crowned queen in a silky yellow dress, her hair in ringlets, her kohled eyes wide. \nOn July 2—her 18th birthday—she was married to Chapo, in what she described as a simple ceremony at her childhood home, surrounded by family and close friends, chickens clucking in the background. Emma wore a diamond-encrusted wedding dress, Chapo a black suit. For the next three days, bands and parties filled the streets of Canelas, ringed by la guardia, uniformed cartel members carrying automatic weapons.\nThe newlyweds escaped to the hill town of El Carrizo and a simple one-story wedding home: yellow with a terra-cotta roof, slender columns reaching up to wooden planks, a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. Inside, Chapo and his teen bride waited out the authorities. Through the window there was a panoramic view of Canelas and the surrounding towns tumbled along the lonesome horizon. Alone with one of the most wanted men in the world, Emma was very much his—and only his.\nAfter the wedding, Chapo moved Emma to a home in Culiacán, the cartel headquarters, population then around 630,000. She had grown up in a place even smaller than Canelas—La Angostura, with just a few dozen inhabitants—in the northwest state of Durango. Culiacán was a shock.\nEmma was often alone while Chapo helped run the cartel—and, it was widely known, he was often with other women. She was just one in a never-ending conveyor belt of beautiful girls, with marriages that seemingly ran one into the next without the punctuation or officiality of divorce. Another of Chapo’s wives, Griselda López Pérez—who was nearly three times Emma’s age—still lived in Culiacán.\nIn those early years of her marriage, Emma began to change. Not in her demeanor, repeatedly described by family and residents of northwestern Mexico as simple and nice. But as her husband accumulated mistresses, the slight young girl shape-shifted into the full-bodied, tightly clad woman of her husband’s desires. \nEvery time her cousin saw her, she was more transformed. Cosmetic surgeries are typical in the region, with women often remolding their faces and enlarging their breasts and butts. \nThen, when she was 21, Emma’s body changed in an entirely different way: She became pregnant. With twin girls.\nAs Chapo’s wife, Emma always felt safe. Untouchable. But her marriage to him assured protection only so long as he was still alive, a matter of whim in the narco world of shifting power dynamics. With Chapo still in power, she felt she and their children would be safe from the violence of the drug world. But if and, inevitably, when something happened to him, she feared she would be left unprotected. Emma wanted to give her future children at least a chance at some measure of lifelong safety. \nEmma was born near San Francisco, a dual American and Mexican citizen, with all the benefits and privileges American citizenship carried. And so, according to a 2011 Los Angeles Times article, nearing her due date and without her husband, Emma crossed the border into Southern California in July of that year, U.S. federal agents reportedly tracking her every move. Around a month later, she gave birth to daughters, born one minute apart at Antelope Valley Hospital in Los Angeles County: American citizens. Following her husband’s strict instructions, on their birth certificates Emma left blank the space for their father’s name, bestowing on them instead her own last name.\nBut she preserved their full parentage in their first names: Emali and Maria Joaquína. One for each parent. \nIt was a lonely time. “Are you going to chat with me all day long or will you be busy?” Emma texted her husband just months after giving birth and preparing for a postpartum surgery. When the twins were six months old, Chapo narrowly escaped capture at a mansion in Los Cabos, Mexico. He and his secretary had escaped over a fence, cutting themselves on some nearby shrubbery. He told his wife about the arrests of two associates, but left out the third arrest of another mistress, Agustina Cabanillas Acosta. “A bit scratched up but fine, thank God,” he texted Emma—relaying a similar message to another mistress, Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, who would later win a seat in the local legislature. \nIn Mazatlán, Sinaloa, the entrance to the Miramar, a lemon-yellow seaside apartment complex, was guarded by a single employee. Above him were 11 stories, the balcony of each apartment etched with a single eye, eerily glinting at the soft, rolling waves of the Pacific.\nChapo, wearing sunglasses and slumped in a wheelchair—and just out of view of video cameras—wheeled through the residence in the darkness. Soon after, Emma slipped by the infinity pool and up to the fourth floor. Her twins and several attendants, whom a maintenance worker later told me had lived in the building without the parents on and off for months, were also in tow. Rounding a secluded corner by the staircase, she pushed open the paneled door of apartment 401 and joined her husband.\nIn the early morning hours, the couple jolted awake to the sound of Mexican and American law enforcement barreling through their front door and charging past the sleeping two-year-olds, guns drawn. \nThis moment, Emma had always known, was inevitable. Chapo grabbed a Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle from his bedside table, leapt into the bathroom, and crouched inside, according to Alan Feuer, author of El Jefe: The Stalking of Chapo Guzmán.\n“Don’t kill him!” Emma screamed as law-enforcement authorities swarmed the couple’s bedroom. She glanced at the bathroom where her husband—her lifeline—was hiding.\n“Please, don’t kill him!”\nWith his wife pleading from the bed and their daughters nearby, Chapo surrendered without fire. “Calm down, I’m here,” Emma recalled her husband saying in an interview with the L.A. Times. Emma knew—she had to know—in that moment that this was the beginning of the unraveling. Both her father and oldest brother had been arrested less than a year before. Many of the men in her life—the very men who had pulled her into this world—were leaving her. \nChapo was incarcerated at Altiplano, a maximum-security prison. At least two women visited him there: Emma and Lucero (by now an elected official, visiting the prison using a fake ID). Both women also met—separately—with Dámaso López Nuñez, a lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel who had worked in the first prison Chapo escaped from when Emma was a child, and who was helping plan his boss’s second escape. Emma had meetings with López Nuñez and Chapo’s sons to disseminate Chapo’s orders as he masterminded the getaway, López Nuñez said later, including the plan to slip him a GPS device disguised as a food item, establishing the coordinates of the kingpin’s cell and the tunnel to be dug beneath it.\nChapo’s detainment was relatively short-lived. Just 504 days after his arrest, he dropped down a hole in his cell shower to a waiting makeshift motorcycle railcar, which he rode through a nearly mile-long tunnel dug under the prison to a warehouse. The escape plan had taken more than a year and approximately $1 million to execute. \nEmma’s youngest brother, Édgar, a teenager, was allegedly waiting there in the tunnel to accompany his famous brother-in-law. Within hours, Chapo was taken to a clandestine airstrip, where he boarded a plane, and disappeared into the mountains. But he would spend that New Year’s Eve not with Emma but Lucero, celebrating the start of 2016 together.\nJust eight days later, Chapo was captured yet again by Mexican authorities and extradited to New York, on six separate indictments filed in states across the country, including running a drug cartel and conspiring to push narcotics across the border. The charges carried a sentence greater even than his own life.\nInside Brooklyn federal court on Jan. 17, 2019, a guest star took the stand: Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López. Dressed in a drab blue prison uniform, the only female cooperating witness to testify against the drug kingpin, Lucero had pleaded guilty to her part in his narco-trafficking conspiracy just months prior.\nFor all the world to hear, she referred to Chapo as “my husband, Joaquín.” The prosecution asked her to detail a years-long romance with the drug lord, which had started in the early days of Emma’s pregnancy. \nIn a narco world in which power is measured in part by the number of girlfriends belonging to a capo, a loyal husband was more than Emma could have hoped for. But having his brazen infidelity internationally publicized must have felt humiliating.\nSeated on a courtroom bench, separated by a divider from her husband, Emma, dressed in a black jacket over a white collared shirt, struggled to maintain her usual stoicism. Lucero spoke in Spanish, and Emma removed her translator headset, listening directly to the woman with whom she’d been sharing her husband.\nThe same age as Emma, with long, dark hair and almond eyes, Lucero, who grew up in a small Sinaloan town, had similar features and a similar background. But when she met Chapo at age 21, she was—unlike Emma—not burdened by the physical and emotional demands of pregnancy. Over two days of testimony that winter, Lucero detailed how she’d run Chapo’s money-laundering operations and overseen drug shipments secreted away on airplanes.\nWhen Anthony Nardozzi, a prosecutor in El Chapo’s case, asked Lucero about the nature of her relationship to the kingpin, she answered: “Well, up until today I’m still confused, because I thought our relationship—we were romantically involved as partners.” Emma bit her thumb.\nAnd in a 2018 televised interview on Telemundo, Emma wondered aloud whether the media “think I’m not human or something,” given the way she felt the media objectified her. “I’m made of meat and bones.”\nThe day after Lucero began testifying, Emma took steps to more permanently secure her place in her husband’s narrative. She had a company registered: El Chapo Guzman JGL, LLC, the rights of which were placed in her name to start a clothing line.\nWhen Emma returned to court for Lucero’s remaining testimony the following week, she and her husband dramatically appeared wearing matching maroon velvet jackets. Lucero, who’d broken down in guttural sobs while testifying, concluded her time on the stand facing a twinning couple. \nWhen Lucero finished, Emma paid an artist more than $1,600 for an exclusively drawn pastel rendering of her and her husband in their matching jackets. Per her explicit instructions, the other woman, in prison garb, was not included. \nPulling off the mountain road, the SUV slashed down a dusty embankment to a white stone-filled creek and into the secluded town of La Angostura. Farther in, past a grove of grapefruit and lemon trees and tucked under the boughs of a towering orange tree, sat a pale yellow, one-story home roofed in terra-cotta.\nThe car pulled to a stop. A man with a gray mustache, white sombrero, and purple-trimmed hoodie slid from the passenger’s side, a puff of sandy dirt clouding his black loafers. This was Victorio Aredo Coronel, a nephew of Emma’s father. Victorio’s son, Gerardo Raudel Hernández Carrasco, popped out the back.\nOn the front porch, several children watched a flat-screen television, the din of a soccer game punctuated by the crowing shrieks of roosters waddling about the front yard.\nClaudia Coronel, in her mid-twenties with a soft voice and long, dark hair, emerged from the house to greet her relatives. A long-ago portrait of her elder sister, Emma, smiled down at them from the porch: dark hooded eyes and plucked brows, with Emma wearing jeans and a mustard tube top, a cross necklace dangling from her neck.\nI’d talked to Emma about going to her childhood home even before her husband’s trial ended. While everyone else in court studied her husband’s every move, I watched Emma, a woman about my age and yet so different. I wanted to better understand her life before her husband. \nNo one will hurt you here: You’re safe, I was told when I arrived in Canelas. About 200 masked men with assault rifles ringed the town’s perimeter—la guardia, serving as guards for the annual coffee and guava festival.  \nNow, outside Emma’s childhood home, where she’d lived until her marriage, Claudia greeted me with a kiss on the cheek: “I follow you on Instagram,” she said, smiling.\nBlanca Estela Aispuro Aispuro—mother to four, including Emma and Claudia—stayed in the kitchen, preparing lunch. \nThe family gathered in a room adjoining the kitchen, a tower of warm flour tortillas mounting through lunch, the fresh piled atop the cooling on an embroidered place mat. Passing a platter of fried bistec and spooning crumbly cotija cheese onto their plates, Emma’s family exchanged news from the recent feria and the crowning of this year’s queen.\nBlanca asked about the festival’s official reina: Was she pretty?\nFrom the other side of the table, Victorio nodded emphatically: Of course! The queen is always pretty, he said.\nGerardo hurried past photographs on his phone, stopping on one of the contestants in an aqua dress, gold-lettered sash, and soaring rhinestone tiara. \nBlanca hunched over the phone, considering. Then, after a while: “My queen is prettier,” she said with a teasing smile.\nWith Chapo’s lifelong incarceration all but certain, Emma, for the first time as an adult, had to think about what her family’s life would look like without him. She made a guest appearance on VH1’s Cartel Crew in November 2019. She created an Instagram account, @therealemmacoronel. On it, she rarely mentioned her husband, instead documenting her own exploration of New York. She also continued experimenting with her hair: golden highlights for Mother’s Day 2020 and on her 31st birthday. By December, she had gone bleached blonde. Her hairstylist said later in an interview at his salon in Culiacán that Emma wanted to “cambiar el look”—change her look. She even posed in a fashion campaign for his salon, wearing a white lace wedding dress, rhinestones scattered down the pleats, a floral hair clip tucked into her long blonde locks.\nIn February 2021, just a few months later, she returned to the salon one last time, had her hair dyed back to its original color, and boarded a plane to Virginia for what one of her lawyers called a business trip. \nShe was arrested at the airport.\nEmma was charged with participating in a conspiracy led by her husband to import cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana into the United States. The complaint against Emma also noted that she had aided and abetted his now-infamous break from the high-security prison in Mexico via the tunnel—likely a crime in Mexico, but not among the charges she faced in the U.S.\nThe conspiracy charge—a legal maneuver that can snag mobsters not easily caught in actual trafficking deals without requiring that they commit the offense themselves—is a wonderfully complicated legal construction. In Emma’s case, conspiring to import drugs was as inconsequential as passing text messages between her husband and father without ever actually touching drugs themselves. In open court, even the main prosecutor on her case called her a mere “cog in a very large wheel of a powerful criminal organization” whose “primary significance on a criminal level” was her “proximity” to her husband.\nFor the next 14 days, Emma was kept under strict COVID-19 protocols in a quarantine unit. When her period started shortly after her arrest, guards provided her with only two sanitary napkins for the next four days. She went just as long without a shower, the word becoming one of the first she learned in English, spelled out letter by letter by her Spanish-speaking lawyer so that Emma could repeat the request to guards in the hope of eventually getting one. In March of that same year, Emma was moved to solitary confinement. \nSnow flurries flitted against a slate-colored sky in Washington, DC. Inside a district courthouse on Constitution Avenue, a bomb-detection dog sniffed the courtroom. “Everything’s good,” the guard declared. Just after noon, flanked by U.S. marshals, Emma, who had been in U.S. custody for nine months, strode in, dressed in a fitted gold-buttoned black pantsuit and heels.\nAppearing solemn behind her black mask, Emma took a seat at a table split by pandemic partitions and swiveled to face Judge Rudolph Contreras. When the judge invited her to speak, Emma adjusted the podium microphone and glanced at her approximately three-and-a-half-minute speech. “I know that you may find it difficult to ignore the fact that I am the wife of Joaquín Guzmán,” she said in Spanish, her voice softly strained. “And for perhaps—” \nThe translator cut her off. Emma sighed and paused, continuing after her words were put into English for the judge: “For this reason, you feel that there is a need for you to be harder on me. But I pray that you not do that.” She told the judge that her daughters, then 10 years old, were “the most important reason why I’m here before you,” adding she hoped to lead by example in encouraging them to own their mistakes: “I accept the mistakes that I have made and I am sorry for them.” \nHer voice cracked as she noted the pain she had put her family through. Her daughters might never have their father, she said, but “I beg you, please do not allow them to grow up without the presence of their mother.” \nAcknowledging the government’s higher sentencing guidelines for the crimes she committed, Judge Contreras, instead, described Emma’s involvement in Chapo’s operation as paling in comparison to that of other Sinaloa cartel members who had passed through his court, and sentenced her to three years behind bars with time served, and the forfeiture of $1.5 million. “Good luck to you,” he said. “I hope that you raise your twins in a different environment than the one that you’ve experienced.”\nFulfilling her sentence in a federal prison in Texas, Emma was transferred to Los Angeles County over the summer and then released. She’s 34—half a lifetime since first meeting El Chapo at that dance, when she caught the eye of a killer and the whole course of her life seemed preordained. \nReturning to her family in Mexico is almost out of the question. In a life with few choices, it turned out she may have made one that would ultimately matter most: seemingly turning a prison sentence into an escape route. \nAnd as Emma walked out of the courtroom on the afternoon of her sentencing, the end of one life promising the start of another, she turned briefly back to her supporters sitting in the audience—and winked.\n“I hope for many good and beautiful things in my life,” Emma would tell me later in her only interview since getting out of prison. She was feeling excited to be with her daughters again, and enjoying “quality moments,” like when her family cooked steak for her upon her release. She said she was focused on her career plans, which are still evolving. “I still can’t say the plans, because then later they won’t come to be,” she added with a laugh. “But many and beautiful.”\nCredits: Emma Coronel Aispuro; lead image: Todd Heisler/Redux.\nEmily Palmer is an investigative reporter, covering courts and crime.

{"title": "Melissa Broder on Why Writing <i>Death Valley</i> ‘Almost Killed Me’", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe poet-turned-novelist talks death, the divine, and getting lost in the desert.\nWriting her latest novel almost killed Melissa Broder—or, anyway, that’s how it seemed when the Milk Fed and So Sad Today author realized she was lost during a solo hike at Death Valley National Park’s Zabriskie Point. The Los Angeles-based Broder had come to this trail to research what would eventually become her third novel, Death Valley. How she ended up lost in “the most touristy area” under the hot April sun with no cell reception, no water, and a bottle of Diet Coke, was thanks to both misdirection and tragedy. \nIn December 2020, Broder’s father was in a car accident, and his resulting injuries required a months-long stay in the intensive care unit. Living on the other side of the country and unable to visit him due to the hospital’s COVID precautions, Broder spent hours driving back and forth between her home in Los Angeles and her sister’s in Las Vegas, “trying to escape a feeling.” \n“I was driving through Baker, [California], which is approximately where the fictional town [in the novel] would be, and the first line of the novel came to me,” Broder says. (The book starts: “I pull into the desert town at sunset feeling empty.”) “I was like, ‘OK, this is it.’ I was working on another novel, and I put it down and started writing this.”\nThis epiphany led to her taking a “desert recon trip” to research Death Valley for her book, where she roamed astray around Zabriskie Point, panicked and cut-up from climbing rocks to find her way. Around 40 minutes after becoming lost, Broder found her way back to her car. “When I got out, I was like, ‘This is a gift.’” she said. “Now I know what’s going to happen in my novel.”\nIn Death Valley, a woman drives to a small desert town under the pretense of researching a book—though, underneath the guise of work, she’s running from feelings of emptiness and doom caused by a chronically ill husband and her injured father in the ICU. But when what’s supposed to be a casual hike turns perilous, the woman encounters a giant cactus, talking rocks, and a huge mustachioed oriole over the course of her multi-day fight for survival. Death Valley, even more than Broder’s past novels, makes powerful use of poetic diction and lyricism as the narrator works to orient herself—both in a physical and emotional sense—to the terrain, the new reality of her “probably dying” father, and the nearly decade-long constant of her sick husband.\nAfter six months in the ICU, and one month after her desert misadventure, Broder’s father died. Now, two and a half years later, Broder sat down with us to discuss why writing this novel felt like such an essential homage to him. \nMy father died over a year before I finished the book. When I finished the book, I had a new experience with grief because the book had been a real connection with him. The day that I sent it off to my agent, I was like, “Oh, he’s not coming back.” \nThere was a lot of similarity. The first few months he was in the ICU, we weren’t allowed to see him because of COVID. I didn’t want to make the book a COVID narrative, but I felt like the distance was really important, the separation and the FaceTime. Because when my father was in and out of consciousness, my sister and I would just talk to him on FaceTime. But there would be times when he didn’t want to talk to anyone. He was fighting for his life. And that was a new learning curve: to not take someone’s ill health personally, and that we have to let people die in their own way and that it isn’t personal.\nWith this book, and actually with a lot of my writing, I can’t not do it. Writing this book almost killed me, but also not writing it would have almost killed me. I just had to do it. It’s really like, cows make milk; writers write. It’s how I orient myself to the world. It’s how I exist and survive in the world. \nThere’s a big difference between writing and editing and publishing. The publishing is more challenging in terms of my perception of the reader. In my writing process, I just go. I try to dismantle any perfectionism and any voices, because otherwise I’ll never write about anything. Editing is when I start to think about clarity, lucidity. \nThe publishing is like closing your eyes and jumping into a pool. I can definitely feel, years after a book comes out, very invaded by something I put out in the world. Like, my 80-year-old Aunt Judy tells me she read So Sad Today and I feel invaded. But it’s like, I put it out there!\nWhat was fun about this book is that it’s totally a sendup of autofiction. Obviously there’s a lot of differences, but someone could read it and say, “Oh, the narrator is the author.” Then you start to get further and you’re like, “Um, did the author go into a magic cactus?” Probably no. That was really fun to do because people are always trying to figure out in novels, “Did this really happen?” Even when I was recording the audiobook, the audio engineer was like, “Is this a true story?”\nI don’t, intellectually, believe that you have to suffer to make art. And even for myself, in a theoretical sense. I would love nothing else more than not to suffer. There’s nothing I would love more, truly. And perhaps a lot of my suffering—and I address this in this book—is caused by a desire of wanting to be at peace. The human experience will have its ups and downs. The alchemy of writing is a way to bring in light and creativity and, in a way, a higher power—if a higher power is (and it is for me) a creative force and not a destructive force.\nWhen she has the vision of the bird, she’s so convinced that her father is dead. That’s a projection of her own experience, however mystical, however divine. I do have a relationship with signs and certainly with a higher power, but I believe that what we believe exists if we choose to believe that it exists. But we can’t project that on other people; faith only goes as far as ourselves. I think it was another lesson for her. Her interpretations and the way she perceived catastrophe were her own projection—it was something coming from herself. And that, to me, was really strong. \nMy father was very funny, very dry, very sarcastic. So a book that is my homage to him has to be funny. And I have to have a good time when I’m writing, especially prose, because it’s such a marathon.\nI feel the same way about incorporating humor as I do with sex scenes. When I write sex scenes, I have to turn myself on. If I don’t turn myself on, there’s no way I’m going to turn on the reader. It’s the same with humor in the sense of, you can feel when you read a book that the writer is having a good time writing it. And I think there’s something really beautiful about that. \nLife and death are also funny in their strangeness. It’s hilarious that we exist and it’s hilarious that we have to die. Both are really dark, but also really funny. \nI did a bunch, dictating, and then I scrapped the whole thing and started again. This was the first piece of prose that I’ve written by typing. I usually don’t edit that hard in my first few drafts—it’s mostly getting the clay out. But with this, because it was for my dad, I wanted it to be a diamond every step of the way. \nI realized dictation wouldn’t work; I edited this like I edit a poem, with the intensity and care. There’s a risk to editing on a sentence level that precisely early on, because, if the structure doesn’t work, a lot of those sentences are going to be thrown away. But I wanted whatever was on the page to be beautiful.\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nClaudia Guthrie is a freelance writer based in Denver.

{"title": "Inside the Sézane Tote Black Market", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe free totes that come with each purchase from the French fashion brand have become so covetable there’s a burgeoning resale community.\nIn Paris, it’s nearly impossible to go within a one-mile radius without spotting a Sézane tote bag. The fashion brand, founded by Morgane Sézalory in 2013, is sort of like the French girl’s Madewell: ubiquitous, utilitarian, but undoubtedly trendy. Like French style, its wares are slightly more feminine—think: bows and florals and lady-like brocade sandals in colors like gold and rosy beige. Though Sézane began as an e-commerce enterprise, it has since expanded into brick-and-mortar locations, and each store is designed to feel like your chicest friend’s apartment on the Left Bank (not unlike Sézalory’s own home, recently profiled in Architectural Digest). Perhaps the most memorable part of a Sézane shopping experience is the free tote bag you get to carry your purchases in, which can instantly become as crucial a part of your style rotation as the clothes and accessories that fit inside it. \nFifteen years ago, when Sézalory was first starting the brand, she wanted to find a way to provide each shopper with a memento—a small token that felt unique. Eventually, she decided on a tote bag. A sustainable linen bag could replace the plastic bags used in French grocery stores at the time, while also serving as valuable real estate space for marketing. “I was thinking, okay, Paris is small, so if you have something that is very visual, and all the girls have it…if you don’t know the brand and you see someone wearing something very cool a few times in the same week, at some point you’re going to think: what is that? And then you look and you end up on the website,” Sézalory told ELLE.com. \nThe idea worked—and a decade and a half later, it’s still working. Sézane fans are unequivocally obsessed with these tote bags. They collect them Facebook groups, on Mercari and French classified ads website Leboncoin, with offers to sell, buy, and trade the free totes. These “Sézane Addicts,” or “Sézanettes,” as they call themselves, are more than 72K strong—and that’s just on Facebook. For limited-edition tote bags, especially those that are part of a special collab like the one the brand recently did with Farm Rio, users will offer cash or a trade to get their bag of choice. “Hello, I’m throwing a bottle to the sea: I fell in love with this tote bag Farm Rio collab but would like to buy it at a reasonable price (15 to 20 euros). If anyone wants to help me?” reads one recent post by a woman named Sandra. (Good luck to Sandra, as that tote, of which Sézane made limited runs, is selling on Vestiaire Collective for more than 135 euros.)\nIn fact, sites like Vestiaire Collective, Poshmark, The RealReal and Mercari are full of people hawking the free Sézane tote bags they got for upwards of 20, 30, even 100 euros. That Farm Rio bag that Sandra’s on the hunt for was the most expensive one we spotted, but others, like this banana-themed one, were selling for 87 euros, and this one—which I actually have two of and had no idea until now it was valuable!—is “on sale” on The RealReal for 92 Euros.\nKimberley Blanchot, one half of the sister duo behind the French-American PR agency August 28 Studio, is one such avid collector (and, full disclosure, a good friend). On a recent trip to her apartment in Neuilly, she opened a cupboard to reveal several shelves packed with dozens of neatly folded tote bags. Though there were ones from brands her firm reps and others she’d collected in New York, the Sézane pile was the most prolific: this woman, and I am not exaggerating, had 20 Sézane tote bags, and with each one she had a little excuse for keeping it: “This one’s great for the beach; I use this one a lot to carry my computer.”\n“I didn’t really set out to collect them, I was just an avid Sézane follower and got one every time I shopped there,” Blanchot said. “ I was living in New York at the time and the brand wasn’t international yet, so there was a bit of a cool factor—I liked that each collection gave life to a new design collab so just naturally started to accumulate them and now here we are.” \nBlanchot isn’t alone. “It started when I became a VIP customer, I received a tote bag as a gift, then during certain orders, I also received free tote bags, and little by little my collection grew,” said Tatiana, a 31-year-old pediatric nurse from Lille. “Today I have 25 tote bags. They are so beautiful and all different, and I continue my little tote bag hunt to unearth rare pearls.”\nAs the bags have grown in popularity, Sézane has begun partnering with others to package and advertise wares together. One recent summer collab featured the French issue of Vanity Fair packaged with a yellow and white striped beach tote; another advertised the gelato brand Amorino. \nThe fact that she started an ongoing Parisian-wide trend doesn’t seem to faze Sézalory, who says she spots the totes around Paris all the time but doesn’t “internalize it.” She recently had her third child, so her own collection of totes has been repurposed. “The quality of [the bags] is great,” Sézalory said. “I put my diapers in it—my Sézane tote is my baby bag.”\nJessica Roy is the former Digital Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "Taylor Swift Was Spotted Flying Out of NYC the Day Before Travis Kelce’s Birthday", "date": "2023-10-05 13:25:00", "text": "Travis Kelce turns 34 today, and Taylor Swift, his new love interest, may be spending the day with him. Multiple sources told Page Six that Swift was seen leaving New York City yesterday. They saw her luggage being loaded into a vehicle outside of her apartment that ultimately went to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.\nA separate source told the outlet that Kelce is in Kansas City, Missouri this week and has no set plans for his birthday due to a “previous work commitment.” Swift has traveled to Kansas City before for Kelce, attending his game there two weeks ago. She stayed until Tuesday morning.\nWhile it isn’t yet confirmed that Swift traveled to see Kelce, she did wear his birth stone, opal, on September 8—potential proof that his birthday was on her mind then. Specifically, the necklace was Foundrae’s Forever & Always a Pair Pendant. Fans later connected the piece of jewelry to Kelce, as dating rumors between the pair started on September 12.\nUs Weekly reported earlier this week that Swift plans to be at Kelce’s games whenever she can and that she isn’t interested in hiding their relationship. The approach is a stark contrast to Swift’s last relationship, which ended in March. During her six years dating Joe Alwyn, the two were almost never seen out together as they embraced privacy.\n“Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back,” one source said. “If something feels right—like it does with Travis—she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”\n“Taylor has decided she’s not going to hide anymore,” a second source said. “She’s going to be her authentic self and enjoy life.” Kelce and Swift “talk every day. Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis. They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Rihanna and A$AP Rocky’s Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 13:51:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nRihanna and her longtime friend A$AP Rocky became much more than friends about three years ago; they welcomed their first child together in 2022. The two have been close since A$AP joined Rihanna’s Diamond Tour in 2013. The singer also starred in A$AP's music video “Fashion Killa” later that year.\nRumors of A$AP and Rihanna's romance first started shortly after Rihanna split from billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel in January 2020, after three years together. A source told People then that “their lives were too different, and it was hard to maintain a relationship.” Shortly after their breakup, Rihanna was seen hanging out with A$AP Rocky more often. A$AP previously dated Kendall Jenner in 2016; their relationship ended in 2017 \nHere's everything we know about the power couple, from when they were first speculated to be in a relationship to how they're doing as new parents at the start of 2023.\nOn December 2, the pair walked the British Fashion Awards red carpet in London. Rihanna wore a Fenty mint green satin dress with matching gloves and wrap, paired with a diamond-studded choker necklace. A$AP sported an all-black tux with sneakers. Janet Jackson presented Rihanna's first fashion award for her Urban Luxe nomination.\nRihanna and A$AP sparked tabloid dating rumors days after her split from Hassan Jameel was reported. According to Entertainment Tonight, Rihanna and A$AP attended the Yams Day Benefit Concert in Brooklyn together.\nA source suggested the two were dating to The Sun, telling the British outlet, “they’re really enjoying each other’s company and taking things easy as it’s still early days.”\nShortly after The Sun's report came out, E! shut down the romance speculation. A source told E!, “Rihanna is single. She just got out of a long intense relationship with Hassan. She's wants to be single and isn't going to jump into something. She's hanging out with A$AP Rocky, but she is not dating him. They have a long history and she's just having fun.”\nMonths after dating rumors were initially denied, A$AP appeared alongside Rihanna in Fenty Skin's ad cameo. The ad also featured Lil Nas X, Tommy Genesis, and Halima Aden.\nRihanna interviewed the “Everyday” rapper in a GQ YouTube video. A$AP answered questions about his skincare routine, throwback outfits, and Fenty Skin. When asked about the most challenging part of working with Rihanna, the rapper said, “I think the hardest part about working with you is not goofin' off and laughing the whole time. Like, this shit is comedy.” A$AP continued, “The hardest part is not having too much fun. You just forget that it's still work at the end of the day.”\nOn November 28, the rumored couple was spotted out with a group of friends at the Beatrice Inn in New York. According to Page Six, the two were “seated discreetly behind a curtain.”\nA couple of days later, People confirmed that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are officially dating. The source did not provide details about the couple's timeline or how serious their relationship is.\nOn December 1, a source gave Entertainment Tonight details about Rihanna and A$AP's relationship.\n“They have always had amazing chemistry, and Rihanna relates to A$AP, and it [their relationship] feels natural, easy and fun,” the source said. “She feels very comfortable around him since they’ve known each other for such a long time and also feels a connection to him because his dad is from Barbados.”According to People, the couple had been inseparable for weeks. A source told the outlet that “it's a new relationship, but they both seem very into it.” A$AP's lifestyle as a famous musician worked with Rihanna's. “They've always seemed to have a great time together,” the source said. “They have a lot in common.”\nUs Weekly reported that the “Goldie” rapper “has been very into Rihanna for years and was always the instigator in their flirtatious connection,” according to a source. The source also mentioned that Rihanna “would brush off his advances and kept him in the friend zone” until now.\n“Things changed over the summer, and they finally hooked up. They've been together ever since,” Us's source said.\nThe couple became more serious as the Grammy-nominated rapper flew to Barbados to join Rihanna and her family for the holidays. According to People, the pair spent Christmas together.\nEntertainment Tonight was told by a source that “spending Christmas together was an obvious step” for their relationship. The source said being longtime friends makes it easier to “get along, travel together, and be involved in each other’s lives to the full extent. They always have such a good time together and definitely seem in love.”\nOn December 24, the low-key couple was photographed by paparazzi in Barbados. TMZ shared a photo of the pair hand-in-hand as they walked to the pier, seemingly confirming their relationship.\nLater that month, paparazzi caught more affectionate moments between the new couple. Rihanna and A$AP were spotted sharing a kiss while enjoying their Catamaran cruise, according to TMZ. The outlet shared a video of the pair jet skiing and tubing alongside Rihanna’s friends.\nOn January 18, the couple and friends celebrated Yams Day, an annual celebration of A$AP Rocky’s late friend and business partner A$AP Yam, who died in 2015. E! reported details of the night as the couple arrived separately.\n“Rihanna arrived with a group of friends and met A$AP Rocky there,” a source told the outlet. “They entered the restaurant through different doors and tried to be discreet. A$AP Rocky entered behind a bodyguard and ducked inside quickly. Once everyone arrived, they sat together with a group of friends.”\nThe source said that the group had dinner and shared stories throughout the evening: “There was lots of food passed around the table and laughter coming from inside. They stayed for over two hours before leaving separately.” Rihanna and A$AP left separately.\nThe couple made a rare sighting in Los Angeles on April 12. The paparazzi photographed the pair leaving dinner at Delilah in matching leather outfits. Rihanna wore a brown leather coat, and A$AP wore a black leather jacket paired with leather pants. It was confirmation that their romance remained very much on a year into the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn a GQ interview, Rocky opened up about his relationship with the Barbadian singer for the first time. In the interview, he referred to Rihanna as “the love of my life” and “my lady.”\nThe rapper did not share when the two began their relationship, but he did discuss what dating Rihanna is like versus playing the field. It's “so much better when you got the One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones,” Rocky said. “I think when you know, you know. She’s the One.”\nHe also spoke about their trip together to Barbados during the holidays. “It was crazy. I always imagined what it would be like for my dad before he came to America. And I got to visit those places, and believe it or not, and there was something nostalgic about it. It was foreign but familiar,” he said.\nOn June 23, the couple was photographed sharing a kiss at Barcade in New York City, a rare PDA moment for them. Rihanna wore a sheer pink high-leg slit dress with a furry hot pink hat. Rocky wore a leather jacket, maroon tank, and leather pants. Later that night, the paparazzi captured the couple leaving the venue as Rihanna wore Rocky’s leather coat with his arms around her.\nA few days later, TMZ posted a video of the couple depicting one of Rocky's grand gestures for his lady. TMZ posted Rocky sweeping Rihanna off her feet as he carried her through New York City’s Lower East Side. According to the outlet, the couple spent the night and early morning partying together.\nRihanna and A$AP went for a date night in Miami at the World Famous House of Mac, where they took photos with the restaurant’s owner, Derrick Turton, who is also Pitbull’s former manager.\nThey cuddled up for photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, in which A$AP wrapped his arm around Rihanna’s shoulder. She put both arms in a hug around his waist. It looked like a very happy night out.\nIn August, the couple enjoyed a date night in NYC, which eventually led to the night club Pergola, where they were photographed leaving at 5 A.M. Rihanna wore a Harley Davidson handkerchief top with very ripped jeans and sandal heels.\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky walked the red carpet of the Met Gala together, an event where the singer would typically make a splash on her own. The theme for the 2021 Met Gala was American Fashion. Rihanna wore a dramatic black ruffle dress from Balenciaga with a beanie and over 267 carats worth Bulgari diamonds. Rocky arrived wearing a patchwork, blanket-like ensemble that looked very cozy.\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky revealed they're expecting their first child together. The two appeared out in New York City, Rihanna showing off her pregnant stomach to paparazzi at the end of the month.\nRihanna showed off some of her famously sexy and flattering maternity wear at the photocall for her Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin party held at Goya Studios in Los Angeles. Rocky was by her side, and the couple smiled and embraced one another for the cameras on the red carpet.\nRihanna wore a shredded green halter top with a backless design, over a pair of pants of the same material in a silver-to-purple ombré pattern. Rihanna's jewelry for the night included amethyst drop earrings, a silver bracelet with violet stones, and a series of Messika rings, including their Wild Moon ring, the Bague Diamond Catcher, and the Messika Bague Exotic Charm ring.\nFor her makeup, the singer and beauty mogul wore a bright red lip, shimmering gold eyeshadow, and her long hair down and parted to the side.\nA$AP Rocky wore Louis Vuitton, a letterman jacket with a matching shirt, a purple Yankees hat to match his girlfriend, and a pair of shredded denim jeans with green sneakers.\nThe event came with an announcement that Savage x Fenty would be launching retail stores with flagships in Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, and Virginia, according to Forbes, and planned to open ten stores. \nEngagement rumors circulated when the pregnant singer was photographed out wearing a stunning diamond ring on her left ring finger.\nWhen photographed with the ring, Rihanna was out shopping for baby clothes in Los Angeles' Kitson, in a vintage Grave Digger monster truck T-shirt with jeans, a statement hat that read “Sex is safer than smoking,” and a Gucci Balenciaga purse. \nA couple days later, paparazzi asked Rihanna about the ring she was wearing and she laughed and teased, via The Daily Mail, “This old ring?”\nThis was a tough month for the couple after Rocky was arrested for a connection to a shooting in Hollywood in November 2021. He was taken in by the Los Angeles Police Department on April 20. The arrest came shortly after the couple landed back in California after visiting family in Barbados. He posted his $550,000 bail and was released just hours later. \nAfter the arrest, Rihanna allegedly canceled her baby shower, and a source told Us Weekly that she “hasn't spoken much about [the arrest]. She's truly focused on her pregnancy and not trying to get too stressed.”\nThe insider added, “She is very confident about everything and has told friends she just hopes for a positive outcome.”\nA$AP was accused of being involved with a shooting near Selma and Argyle Avenues following an argument. A man alleged that he was approached by the rapper at around 10:15 P.M. on November 6 and that A$AP fired a handgun at him three or four times. The victim's left hand was grazed by a bullet, and he sought medical treatment. \n“Rihanna was there when Rocky was arrested and has been crying non-stop,” another source claimed to The Sun. “She's heavily pregnant and these are very serious accusations, it's a nightmare scenario for her...It was meant to be Rihanna's baby shower in LA on Wednesday night, but they had to cancel.”\nThe source said, “Rihanna was very, very upset and stressed by Rocky's arrest. It's not the best time for her to be on such an emotional rollercoaster.”\nThat same month, gossip spread on Twitter that A$AP Rocky cheated on his pregnant girlfriend with shoe designer Amina Muaddi during May's Paris Fashion Week, but TMZ got clarification from a source directly connected to Rocky and Rihanna on the rumor's validity. It's absolutely not true, the source said.\nThe source said, “100% false on both counts,” adding again that it's “1 million percent not true. They're fine.” \nRihanna and A$AP Rocky's  “very fly” baby arrived. Rihanna gave birth to a baby boy on May 13 in Los Angeles, TMZ reported. The baby's name  was not immediately shared.\nA source close to the couple told People that the two were home in Los Angeles with him. “Rihanna is doing well. They are very excited to be parents. Rihanna is already a wonderful mom,” the source said.\nIt's announced that Rihanna will be headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2023.\n“Rihanna is excited for her Super Bowl performance,” the source told ET. “She is trying to stay on the healthier side and feel good and fit ahead of it.”\nRihanna herself told ET's Rachel Smith that she had a form of buyer's regret after the halftime news was announced.\n“I can’t believe I even said yes,” she explained. “It was one of those things that like, even when I announced it I was like, ‘I can’t take it back now. It’s final. I can’t believe... what did I just get myself into?’ Because the Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages in the world. It’s an entertainer's dream to be on the stage like that, but it's nerve-racking. You wanna get it right. You know everybody's watching. And they're rooting for you, and I wanna get it right. It's a challenge I was willing to accept. Being a new mom, nothing would have gotten me out of the house if it wasn't a challenge like that.”\nShe added, “It was now or never. Yeah, for sure. For sure. You can get real comfortable at home as a mom.”\nShe then shared a little about what her daily mom experience has been like and her favorite part.\n“Oh my god, the mornings, like, seeing his morning face!” Rihanna declared. “Seeing a baby with, like, little bags and waking up and they're just, like, startled. They're trying to figure out where they’re at. It's the cutest, it's my favorite part of the day.”\nThe Grammy-winning singer walked the red carpet with A$AP at the premiere of Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, their first time at a red carpet event since the birth of their son. Rihanna's singles “Lift Me Up” and “Born Again” appeared on the soundtrack for Ryan Coogler's Marvel sequel.\nThe premiere was held at the Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre, where Rihanna wore a sparkly, strapless dress by designer Rick Owens and a pair of opera gloves and matching pointed-toe heels.\nRocky matched his girlfriend in tone with an  oversized khaki jacket and matching pants with a black T-shirt underneath. \nA source told Entertainment Tonight that Rihanna hopes to expand her family with A$AP Rocky someday.\nThey added she has “dreamed of being a mom,” and would “love nothing more” than to have more kids with the rapper.\n“Rihanna and A$AP are so in love and have the best time together,” the source added. “They are also a great team when it comes to being parents to their baby boy. Rihanna always dreamed of being a mom and she takes a lot of pride in it. She would love to have more children with A$AP in the future.”\nRihanna shared her baby's face for the first time with a debut TikTok video.\nIn the adorable video, the baby is strapped in his car seat and smiling and gurgling as Rihanna speaks to him off-camera. She asks him, “You tryna get Mommy's phone?”\nHe smiles in response.\nRihanna captioned the video, “Hacked.”\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Rocky shared what it's been like to be a dad and share a family with Rihanna.\n“Oh, man,” he said when first asked about Rihanna's upcoming halftime show. “I’m just as excited as you guys, if not more. Yeah, I’m super excited. This is as huge. This is incredible. I’m so glad that my lady’s back making music again and whatnot, and getting back out there. It’s just incredible. Especially for both of us, it is a good year for both of us to be more active and be out there. But the Super Bowl is huge, and her being the creative she is she going to bring it, man. I’m excited. I’m more excited than everybody else, honestly.”\nHe went. onto say about fatherhood, “It’s so unexplainable. It’s just one of those things. I’m a member of our club now, like the dad club. You see a dad, you see me. I’m playing on, I’m a full dad now. Being outside and working and being creative, it drives more energy for you…to think and soak things up like a sponge now that I’m a dad, because I have a whole ‘nother perspective. But it honestly helps you get home to your family and get home to your baby. And I can’t even explain it, man. You come home to heaven every day. I’m so thankful. God is good, man.”\nThat same month, the couple made a glamorous appearance at the Golden Globe awards, where Rihanna was nominated for Best Original Song, Motion Picture. Rihanna wore a gorgeous black gown by Schiaparelli couture and accessorized with Giuseppe Zanotti shoes and a Cartier diamond necklace and earrings. \nOkay, this is major now. Rihanna and Rocky are in the building.

She really kicked things into gear and got right to work after she received the call.”\nThey also explained she's been non-stop in the studio and has been “very hands on with every detail throughout the entire process.”\n“It is super exciting for her to get back out there and perform since having her son and she feels rejuvenated after taking some time off,” they explained. \nTo do all of this, especially with an eight-month-old son, Rihanna has been receiving a lot of support from her boyfriend. \n“A$AP has been very supportive throughout her preparation and has really been stepping up his parenting game while she has been busy with rehearsals,” the source said. “[A$AP] and her son plan to be there supporting her during her big day.”\nDuring the Super Bowl, Rihanna announced her second pregnancy with A$AP Rocky.\nShe spoke in a British Vogue interview published days later about their relationship being strengthened with the arrival of their baby boy. “We’re best friends with a baby,” she said with a laugh. “We have to be on the same page, but we’ve always kind of had that in our relationship. Everything changes when you have a baby but I wouldn’t say it’s done anything but made us closer.”\nRihanna and Rocky continued making appearances out and about as a couple. Rocky joined Rihanna at the Oscars where she performed, and footage went viral of him cheering for her at the ceremony.\nIt’s Asap Rocky always cheering her on for me😍😩🥹🤩 #Oscars2023 #Oscar #Oscars pic.twitter.com/PV1j5zlwYb\nThey were also photographed together backstage, with Rocky touching her baby bump:\nRihanna gave fans a rare look at her and Rocky's son for his first Easter with the family: \nRocky dropped his second hint of summer 2023 that he and Rihanna may be married with the release of his song “Riot.” His lyrics included, “My wife is erotic, I'm smokin' exotic (Woo, woo) / My whip is exotic, my crib is a cottage (Woo, woo, woo).” In the second verse, he teased a potential music project with her: “New collab' with my baby mom (Woo, woo, woo),” and he also name-dropped her later in the song: “Pass on a sweetie, I got me a RiRi.”\nNeither Rocky nor Rihanna commented on the marriage rumors or confirmed them.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nSelena Gomez hosted her first Rare Impact Fund benefit last night, and the singer leaned into extravagant dressing. The star wore three dresses throughout the night, starting with a custom Valentino silver floor-length gown on the red carpet with Messika dangle earrings. \nGomez switched into minidresses for the rest of the night. Next, she wore a purple floral one by Rahul Mishra  on the red carpet.\nInside the gala, she switched into a floral Monse minidress with a zebra print when speaking on stage.\nHer friend and kidney donor Francia Raisa wore a matching silver gown with her on the red carpet. Raisa told Extra the two hadn’t coordinated outfits on purpose: “The only thing we coordinated was our spray tans, [which we got together],” she said. “We didn’t talk about our dress.”\nShe also addressed their friendship following past feud rumors, saying, “We trauma bonded [when we first met as teens over exes], which is beautiful, but also it can get rocky and tricky. People grow, relationships change, obviously I treat her like my little sister she treats me like her older sister. I don’t know any relationship that’s perfect. When our situation came up—no, I never pictured that, but obviously I never regretted it. I am happy that we are here today celebrating and supporting each other.”\nOf their evolution, she said, “I am a different person today than I was last year or even when I turned 30, I’m 35 now, even when Selena turned 30, I’m like, ‘It’s different isn’t it?’ and she was like, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Welcome to your 30s, now we can get to know each other again.”\nGomez spoke to People at the event about feeling more at ease in her 30s. “Now that I’m 30, I care less, so it’s actually nice,” she said. “I get to focus on the things that actually matter, and I’m not worried about things that were holding me back.”\nRegarding the benefit, Gomez said, “It is my first time throwing something and I hate asking people for money, so I don’t know. It’s like a weird concept, but I know that we’re doing a good thing and I couldn’t be more lucky to have the platform to do that.” \nHer Rare Impact Fund donates to mental health organizations, which you can learn more about here.

{"title": "The Real Reason Adele Has Been Calling Rich Paul Her ‘Husband’", "date": "2023-10-05 16:45:00", "text": "Adele has regularly been calling Rich Paul her “husband” during her Las Vegas residency, sparking rumors that the couple may have secretly tied the knot. But they haven’t, a source told Us Weekly. It’s just a term of endearment. In fact, Paul started calling Adele his “wife” two months into dating, the source said.\n“They aren’t married but they do call each other husband and wife and have been for a while now,” the source continued. “Adele loved the security [of it] and how much he adores her.”\nAdele and Paul have been dating since 2021. They sparked engagement rumors in February 2022 when Adele wore a big diamond ring on her left ring finger at the BRIT Awards. When asked about the rumors while wearing the ring again during her Graham Norton Show appearance, Adele said, “If I was [engaged], would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn’t?”\nELLE asked Adele about the engagement rumors months later in August 2022. At first, she dodged the question, saying: “Well! Well. Well, I’m not married. I’m not married.” Then she added, “I’m just in loooove! I’m happy as I’ll ever be. I might as well be married.”\nShe later clarified in another conversation for the piece that “I’m not engaged.

{"title": "All About Rich Paul, Adele's Boyfriend and One of the Biggest Sports Agents in the NBA", "date": "2023-10-05 16:53:00", "text": "The tables are turning for pop superstar Adele, who—despite keeping a low profile following her divorce from Simon Konecki, which was finalized in March 2021—has found love stateside. \nOn July 24, 2021, she and sports agent Rich Paul were seen out on a date at NYC hotspot Cipriani; The Sun obtained photos. The PDA-filled photos seemed to confirm the romance, which was also confirmed by Page Six on July 20, 2021.\nOnly a few days before the Page Six post, they were seen together for the first time. On July 17, 2021, British singer was spotted laughing and cheering alongside Paul at Game 5 of the NBA Finals, in which the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns.\nPaul was apparently there alongside his client LeBron James to support friend Chris Paul, a player for the Suns. On a late-night podcast following the game’s conclusion, ESPN's Brian Windhorst seemingly confirmed the relationship between Paul and the “Rolling in the Deep” singer.\n“Rich Paul brings his girlfriend to the game to sit next to LeBron. His girlfriend is Adele,\" Windhorst said. \"This is the first time that they’ve come out in public together.”\nPage Six confirmed the two were involved on Tuesday, July 20, with a source telling the outlet that Adele and Paul are “100 percent” dating.\nNot much is known about the relationship nor its impetus, but it's possible the two have been an item since as early as May 2021. In a profile of Paul for The New Yorker, interviewer Isaac Chotiner detailed the following exchange between the sports agent and Adam Mendelsohn, a friend and adviser to both Paul and James.\nThe “major pop star” in question is almost undoubtedly Adele, and it appears the two have made their relationship official in the months since the article's release. And while Adele has, of course, received the majority of the press since the couple was spotted at Game 5, Paul has a storied career of his own. Here's what we know about the agent's background. \nBorn and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, in the neighborhood of Glenville, 41-year-old Paul became a sports agent after meeting a teenaged James at the Akron-Canton Airport in 2002. Paul was wearing a Houston Oilers jersey that caught James's eye, and the two of them stayed in touch, eventually becoming such close confidantes that Paul went to work at Creative Artists Agency, under James's then-agent Leon Rose. Developing a strong business savvy, he was eventually able to strike out on his own.\nToday, Paul has his own agency—Klutch Sports Group, which he started in 2012—and is one of the most well-known agents in sports. His clients include James, Philadelphia 76ers player Ben Simmons, Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis, and Golden State Warriors player Draymond Green, among a slew of others. \nWindhorst—the podcaster and ESPN reporter who revealed Adele was Paul's “girlfriend”—has written several books about James and has developed a close relationship with Paul as well. He told the New Yorker's Chotiner, “The burden that Rich faces is that people question his legitimacy. They want to delegitimize him because of his race, because of his lack of education, because he used to sell jerseys out of the trunk of his car. If that’s the best they can do, they have to do a lot better.”\nIn March 2021, around the time Paul supposedly started “hanging out” with Adele, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the sports agent would release a memoir titled Lucky Me. The book is a coming-of-age story to be published by Roc Lit 101, the publishing division of Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation. \nThe memoir will apparently follow Paul's upbringing in Cleveland, his relationship with his family, as well as his rise to the top of his field in sports. \n“Lucky Me is more than my story,” Paul revealed in a press statement. “Lucky Me is the story of every young Black man who grew up like me. I want to use my story to uplift and inspire those who lived this and educate those who didn’t. I cannot tell you what it means to partner with my friend and mentor Jay-Z on this project. Lucky Me was the name of the book before I even spoke with Jay because his music was my life’s soundtrack.”\nThe first photos of the couple together were taken during the NBA Finals, though they certainly looked at ease court-side.\nAn eyewitness at the game told Entertainment Tonight, “They had their eyes on each other almost as much as they did on the game!”\nIt took just days for media outlets to confirm the news that Windhorst broke: Adele and Paul truly are a couple. Page Six was told by a source that “they are [definitely] dating,” on July 20. Details about what their relationship is like or how they met remain private at this point.\nPeople got a little more insight on July 20 about Adele and Paul's timeline. The outlet was told by a source that their relationship isn't brand, brand new. A source said that they've actually been dating for “a few months.” Paul and Adele's reps didn't respond to the outlet's request for comment, a hint that the two are likely keep their relationship details as private as possible.\nE! spoke to a source close to Adele in early August about why the singer has been more willing to have her romance with Paul in the spotlight. The source called their relationship “bit of a whirlwind.”\nThat said, “she's very happy and loves being with him.” Paul is “outgoing” and wants to  “out and about,” which Adele has “embraced,” the outlet's source said. “She's not as concerned about being private with her life because she's very happy with Rich.”\nPeople was told by a source on September 1 that Paul and Adele's relationship isn't just causal anymore. “They went to LeBron James' party together,” a source told the outlet. “He often brings her around his friends. She seems to be getting along with everyone. They act like they are getting more serious.”\n“She is having fun dating Rich,” the source added. “They spend a lot of time together. Adele seems very happy.”\nAdele slipped a picture of herself posing with Paul at a party into a slideshow of her beautiful strapless dress on Instagram. The two were at a the wedding LA Lakers star Anthony Davis.\nThe photo booth image shows them smiling and happy and very much in couple mode.\nRich Paul accompanied Adele to London, where she is preparing for her show at the London Palladium next week, E! News reports. This will be Adele's first show in the U.K. in four years and it's the first time Paul has joined her in her own country. They have also met one another's kids, and a source told E! in September that their relationship has “become more serious in the last few months” and the singer is “very much in love with Rich.”\nTaking him back home with her to England does seem serious. Her show will be available as an ITV special, An Audience With Adele, beginning November 21.\nAdele opened up a little about Paul to Rolling Stone in the magazine's cover story about her ahead of 30's release. Celebrity gossip Instagram DeuxMoi outed her relationship with the sports agent, Adele said. “I didn’t really tell many of my friends at the beginning because I wanted to keep it to myself,” she said. The two first appeared together at a discount mall. “None of them believed it!”\nShe added that Paul has met her son, and their relationship is “incredible, openhearted, and [the] easiest [one]” she has ever been in because of the self-growth and healing she’s done.\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey during her Adele: One Night Only TV special, the singer opened up about her relationship with Paul and what makes it so special. She said it's the first time she’s truly “loved myself and been open to loving and being loved by someone else.” So, Winfrey asked, is the lucky sports agent getting a different Adele than everyone else has gotten?\n“Yeah,” Adele answered hesitantly. “By arriving and turning up [for myself], maybe I’m getting a different version of him at all. It’s just timing. It’ll be interesting to see what my reaction will be like in general to anything that hurts me now that I feel so secure in myself. And I’m talking outside of romance as well.”\nAdele showed off her new kicks on Instagram Stories, a pair of white New Balance 550s that are a collaboration between the brand and her boyfriend, Rich Paul, even featuring his name on the sneakers' tongue.\n“Congratulations @richpaul,” she wrote across the post.\nThe collaboration between Paul and New Balance will also include apparel. These white shoes have a classic look and feature blue and yellow accents. Adele shared yet another image of them from further away, posting hearts over the photo.\nShe was also wearing a pair of cream sweatpants with blue stripes, matching the shoe's color story. \nOn Thursday, December 16, the couple appeared at SoFi Stadium with Jay-Z and LeBron James' business partner Maverick Carter in a luxury suite. They were photographed holding hands by ESPN as they enjoyed the Kansas City Chiefs-L.A. Chargers game.\nWho the heck are Jay-Z and Adele’s +1s???? 🧐 https://t.co/36XFD9Xajv\nJames joked about the photos on his Twitter account, quote-tweeting the images and asking, “Who the heck are Jay-Z and Adele’s +1s????”\nObviously, both Paul and Carter are quite well-known the the NBA star.\nAdele and Paul's relationship quietly remains on and strong. While the two were apart on Adele's 34th birthday, People reports the couple had dinner in Napa Valley on May 8.\n“Adele is still seeing Rich,” a source said. “They are both very busy though. She is working on her residency and Rich is busy with his clients. They see each other when they can.”\nOn June 25, Adele and Rich Paul attended Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Kate Bock’s wedding at the New York Public Library. A photo of them in their full glam was posted to LeBron James' Instagram account. They stood as a couple across from James and his wife, Savannah James.\nAdele wore an off-the-shoulder black gown that ended at just her ankles and which was draped with sheer tulle fabric. She was wearing pointed black pumps and carried a black clutch. Paul was in a black tuxedo tailored to fit the Great Gatsby theme of the evening with a classic fit.\nJames captioned the photo, “ICONIC.” \nOn June 11, 2022, during interview with E! News, Paul seemed to hint that he'd be open to having more children and being an “older dad.”\n“As a young dad, growing a business, it was pretty tough,” he said. “But now looking as an older dad and my kids being much older, and obviously, if I was to have more kids ... I'm looking forward to being a different dad, a more patient dad.”\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Four's Desert Island Discs on July 1, 2022, Adele said she'd “definitely like a couple more kids” with Paul. She has one child now, nine-year-old son Angelo, who she shares with her ex-husband, Simon Konecki.\n“I would definitely love a couple more kids,” she said. “It would be wonderful. If not, I've got Angelo.”\nAdele has mentioned wanting to have more children before, saying in an interview on the Graham Norton Show in February that her recently cancelled Caesars Palace Las Vegas residency would “absolutely 100% happening this year.”\nShe explained, “It has to happen this year because I've got plans for next year. Imagine if I have to cancel because I am having a baby!”\nDuring a late August Las Vegas residency show, Adele spoke to two fans about her hope to have another child on the sooner side. “I really want to be a mom again soon, so every time I see a name I like, I write it down in my phone,” Adele said, via Entertainment Tonight. “I can't say Parker because Rich likes that name.” Adele noted that she likes the names Ray and Spencer.\nAdele was featured on the cover of ELLE's September issue, where she gushed about how her relationship with the sports agent is unlike anything she's ever experienced.\n“I've never been in love like this. I'm obsessed with him,” she announced. When asked if she'd consider remarrying following her divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki, Adele answered, “Yes, absolutely.”\nShe went to say, “I definitely want more kids. I'm a homemaker and I'm a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music. But right now, all I got in my brain is [my upcoming Las Vegas residency]. I wanna f*cking nail it.”\nPaul celebrated his 41st birthday on December 16, 2022. Adele serenaded her sweetheart while on stage at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. She sang him \"Happy Birthday,\" and naturally, it went viral. Fans took to Twitter to share the wholesome moment.\n“It’s my boyfriend’s birthday today, and I love him more than life itself,” she said. “Can we wish him happy birthday?”\nsinging happy birthday to rich. That was actually so beautiful🥺♥️ pic.twitter.com/yeJyBffJS6\nAdele played coy when she sparked Paul engagement rumors last February by wearing a diamond ring on her left ring finger to the BRIT Awards. She said, days after on the Graham Norton Show while still wearing the ring, “If I was [engaged], would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn't?” \nA year later at the end of February 2023, unverified celeb gossip Instagram DeuxMoi claimed that Adele and Paul really were engaged and planning to get married in the summer, per a “reliable source.” DeuxMoi did not disclose who this source was or what makes them reliable, however, and Adele has not ever confirmed her engagement. It's just more fodder to the engagement rumor.\nAdele and Paul had a casual date on Friday, April 28, attending the NBA game at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles where the city's Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies were facing each other in the playoffs. The singer was wearing a grey tracksuit from Klutch Athletics, her fiancé's sportswear brand he co-authored with New Balance. Though the outfit was relaxed, she had on some glam makeup, including a smokey eye and dark lipstick. \nPaul was also in a tracksuit set, this one in patterned white and green with a zippered jacket.  \nOn Saturday, May 6, the couple were seen on another date at the Crypto Arena in Los Angeles for the 2023 NBA playoffs. The singer was wearing a two piece made of flowing tan fabric with loose slacks and matching button down. She paired the look with black sandal heels and hold hoops that matched her necklaces and bracelets. Paul wore a black tracksuit with green details over a white t-shirt underneath and a pair of colorful sneakers. They were seated next to actress Nia Long and the stadium was full of other celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Rob Zombie, Kevin Hart, and Michael B. Jordan.\nThe couple has been regularly calling each other husband and wife despite not being married, and Adele has made headlines for doing it during her Las Vegas residency.\nA source told Us Weekly that Paul actually started calling Adele his wife two months into dating.\n“They aren’t married but they do call each other husband and wife and have been for a while now,” the source said. “Adele loved the security [of it] and how much he adores her.”\nHilary Weaver is a freelance writer based in New York who writes about politics, queer issues, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and every woman the Queen has ever made a dame.

The next, it’s your groceries, and the day after that, your toiletries and a pair of shoes for that upcoming flight. My point is: You need a good tote bag for just about every and any occasion. It’s the most useful type of bag, but because it’s for all occasions, it should also be on-trend and comfortable—just versatile enough to work in every scenario. With all the hype around puffer styles right now, why not incorporate the quilted look into more than just a winter puffer jacket or vest with a chic puffer tote bag?\nNot only are these bags super practical and workable, but they are equally chic and cool. The style aligns with current fall 2023 bag trends, but can still be used as your work bag, weekender, or even gym bag. Here, find 15 puffer tote bags that are both cool and functional. \nThe customization and metallic finish on this tote elevate it perfectly. \nThink Royln is known for its puffers, and I am obsessed. This messenger tote is perfectly sized, and the crossbody strap makes it so comfortable. \nSustainable brand Baggu is saving the planet one bag at a time. This tote offers a slightly unique take on the puffer trend and is perfect for everything. It’s simple but has a great shape.\nI happen to own this bag, and it fits everything without weighing too much, no matter how much I stuff inside. It has a super chic feel, and the quilted puffer material is so chic—plus, it’s also a favorite of our senior shopping commerce editor.\nCoachtopia is the brand’s ultra-successful foray into trendier styles. The patch detailing here is cute, and the cloud-shaped stitching is unreal. \nThis COS bag is extremely on-trend. It’s technically an oversized tote bag, but it doesn’t feel too big when worn. It also looks super cool with any outfit.\nH&M is great at making affordable yet elevated styles that feel far more expensive. I would classify this bag as just that—price-conscious yet sophisticated.\nThis bag can fit way more than you’d think by the looks of it. Because of all the pockets, it is great for storing all the little things—and even a few big things.\nAnother trend we’ve been seeing lately of is mini bags. Although not quite mini, the strap on this is shorter than most other totes. The bag itself is plenty spacious, but the shorter handle makes it idea for transitioning from day-to-night.\nI love the stretchy, silky material on this bag, which differentiates it from other puffer totes. Plus, it’s really durable, so it will last the test of time.\nRain or shine, this bag is a must-have.

{"title": "Francia Raisa Says Selena Gomez Friendship Had a ‘Rocky’ Moment: ‘It Had Nothing to Do With the Kidney’", "date": "2023-10-05 19:46:00", "text": "Selena Gomez’s longtime friend Francia Raisa attended Gomez’s first Rare Impact Fund benefit last night and candidly addressed their friendship history during a red carpet interview. \nRaisa donated one of her kidneys to Gomez in 2017 when she was in dire need of one due to her lupus condition. Fans speculated that Gomez and Raisa may have had a falling out after Raisa posted and deleted a shady comment following Gomez’s Rolling Stone interview last fall, where Gomez said Taylor Swift was her only friend “in the industry.”\nIn July this year, Raisa shut down feud rumors, telling paparazzi, “There’s no beef, guys.”\nAt the Rare Impact Benefit, Raisa explained to Extra that her and Gomez’s relationship, which started when they were teenagers, has had its ups and downs.\nRaisa said she believed they met in 2008 “when I was on Secret Life of the American Teenager on ABC Family at the time, she was on Wizards of Waverly Place. Disney had the stars of their shows come down to Children’s Hospital and visit all the kids. They put us all in groups, and she was in my group. She came up to me and was like, ‘My mom had a teenage pregnancy, she was 16, and we love your show.’ I was like, ‘Oh, my God, thank you! I love your show.’ And then we started talking, we both had boyfriends at the time, we started kiki-ing… And then around the time that my boyfriend and I broke up, and her and her boyfriend broke up, she called me and was like, ‘I’m going through some stuff. You’ve always been so nice to me. I’m going through a breakup.’ I was like, ‘Girl, me, too,’ and we were just inseparable after that ever since.”\nRaisa said she didn’t anticipate their journey to evolve the way it did. “We trauma-bonded, which is beautiful, but also it can get rocky and tricky,” Raisa continued. “People grow, relationships change. But obviously, I treat her like my little sister, she treats me like her older sister. I don’t know any relationship that’s perfect. They all go through things. So when our situation came up [with me donating her one of my kidneys], I mean, no, I never pictured that, but obviously I never regretted it. I am happy that we are here today, celebrating and supporting each other.”\nRaisa added that she and Gomez have both changed a lot too. “I am a different person today than I was last year or even when I turned 30,” she said. “I’m 35 now. Even when Selena turned 30, I’m like, ‘It’s different, isn’t it?’ and she was like, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Welcome to your 30s. Now we can get to know each other again.”\n“Sometimes I feel people need to spend time apart to grow individually and then come back together. I think that’s what relationships are about,” Raisa added. She and Gomez “had to almost go on our own journey and grow,” she continued, “and now I am really happy in my career now and my endeavor. I don’t know if I would be able to do that if I didn’t really take some time for myself and figure out what the hell was going on with me, because I wasn’t okay.”\nRaisa clarified that her personal struggle was rooted in her childhood, not in her donating a kidney to Gomez. “I am okay now, and just for the record, it had nothing to do with the kidney because I don’t want any clickbait,” she said. “It had nothing to do with that. I went through a lot in my childhood and I’ll be talking about it very soon about exactly what happened. She has been such a huge support through all of that.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

He leaves her a fire emoji just to let her know how he feels about her look.\nThey were allegedly seen kissing at the Met Gala afterparty but did not walk the red carpet together.\nStarting in July of that year, the couple slowly started talking more about their relationship.\n“I'm in a relationship, but it's a very private relationship,” Turner told the U.K.'s Sunday Times on July 4. She didn't say much else, except for sharing that she recently had become much more extroverted under the influence of... someone.\n“I very much isolated myself for a while and forgot what was fun. Going out with friends, going out to eat, not really having a care,” she explained. “And people I've met recently in my life have drawn me out of that. It really helps you own those insecurities. The things I tortured myself about before, I can forget about.”\nOn July 21, at Comic Con, Turner calls Jonas “a good accessory” before getting flustered. \n“I don't know, I don't know,” she tells Entertainment Weekly of Jonas rooting for her Thrones character Sansa Stark. “We don't talk about it...You made me blush! Oh god, yeah! I'm sweaty, I can't tell.”\nThe next day, she arrives at LAX wearing a denim jacket embroidered with “Kissing Strangers,” the name of a DNCE single.\nThen, on July 25, Turner shared in an interview with Marie Claire UK that she was “very happy” with Jonas, but it's not easy being in public.\n“You do feel like you're living in a fishbowl! It's frustrating [that] it's the most mundane things that make the news—how boring! There are really no other headlines?” Turner said.\nThey adopt a puppy together, a Siberian Husky puppy named Porky Basquiat who currently has almost 100k followers on its own Instagram account. \nAfter just about a year together, they announce their engagement with matching Instagram posts featuring the pear-cut diamond on Turner's finger.\n“She said yes,” Jonas captioned his pic. \nTurner wrote, “I said yes.”\nIn a comment, Nick Jonas wrote, “Ahh! Congratulations to my brother… and sister in law to be on your engagement. I love you both so much.”\nTurner opens up about being engaged to People, saying it was fulfilling in a whole new way.\n“It's lovely to be engaged,” she said. “Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career.”\nOn October 3, the couple make their red carpet debut at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week, though it was more of a street corner. \nTurner shared a pic from inside the event, where Jonas is kissing her on the cheek.\n“With my love in Paris,” she captioned the image.\nThe pair spent the holidays in London with Jonas' family, including the newly-married Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra. \n“Family,” Turner captioned the group pic of everyone enjoying dinner.\nTurner says in a cover story with Glamour UK that Jonas helped her find herself again after she had an “identity crisis” from growing up too fast amid her Games of Throne stardom.\n“A lot of [my happiness now] is to do with being with a person I've fallen in love with, who loves me more than he loves himself, and who wants to see me find my own happiness,” she said. “That was probably the biggest thing that pushed me to find who I am—and find my happiness in things other than acting.”\nThat same month, Turner starred in the Jonas Brothers' music video for “Sucker” along with Kevin Jonas' wife Danielle and Nick Jonas' wife Priyanka. \nLater, she told USA Today that making the video was “a lot more chaotic” than usual.\n“[With Game of Thrones] you have to be done with this scene by a certain time, and you have to say these words and stand at exactly these spots, because otherwise it wouldn't work. Whereas with a music video, it's just much more kind of free and loose and improvisational,” she explained.\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, Turner admitted they secretly broke up for about 24 hours before getting back together.\n“It was the worst day of our lives. For a second we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both, like, ‘Never mind,’” Turner said.\nThat month, they committed hard and had a last-minute wedding in Las Vegas at the famous A Little White Wedding Chapel just a few hours after the Billboard Music Awards. Diplo live-streamed the event on his Instagram, Dan + Shay played music, and they said their vows with Ring Pop wedding rings. While his brothers were there, they forgot to invite the parents.\n“We had to get legally married in the states, so we thought it'd be really fun to get all of our friends, invite them out, and do an impromptu wedding,” Jonas later told GQ. “And we actually had some people that I didn't really even know that well there.” \nThat month, they also walked the Met Gala red carpet together again.\nOn June 29, they get married again in France for a more official ceremony with everyone gathered together.\nThe event was held at Le Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, France, and Turner's Game of Thrones costar Maisie Williams was her maid of honor. Nick and Kevin stood up with their brother. \nThey don't share many pics but occasionally dole out one or two for the fans. \nTurner is spotted out with Jonas in Los Angeles, and it sure looks like she has a baby bump. A source tells People, “They are definitely preparing for the baby... She and Joe are both very happy.”\nOn July 22, 2020, Turner gives birth to the couple's first child, a baby girl named Willa. Their reps tell People, “Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are delighted to announce the birth of their baby.” \nOnce Willa is born, Turner seems to be comfortable finally sharing pregnancy pics. She posts one in her pool with their dog, another with Jonas placing his hands on her stomach, and one of her sitting on a couch outside in her bikini.\nFor the couple's second wedding anniversary, Turner decides to let loose with the French wedding pics, revealing that it included a DJ set from Diplo, music from the Jonas Brothers, and a beautiful pool\nJonas makes an appearance on CBS This Morning and talks about how “amazing” things have been during quarantine.\n“It's been forced time at home,” he explained. “I'm always moving and traveling and touring. And to be in one place for a solid amount of time and just have my feet on the ground and be with my immediate family, is time I don't think I'll get back. I'm so thankful and grateful.”\nThe pair sell their Los Angeles home and move to Miami. Turner later tells ELLE UK that she hopes they end up in England.\n“We're very lucky to live in Miami. We have good weather and live by the water,” she shared. “I really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family. And also for my daughter—I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!”\nThe couple celebrate the 5th anniversary of their first date, with Jonas posting on TikTok with a montage commemorating meeting Turner for the first time.\nOn May 2, Turner and Jonas walk the red carpet at the Met Gala, and they're accompanied by Turner's new baby bump.   \nA day later, they officially confirm the news when Turner talks about how much she loves being a mother with ELLE UK.\n“It's what life is about for me—raising the next generation,” Turner explained. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever.”\nJonas is interviewed by People for a cover story with the Jonas Brothers, and discussed being a dad again, saying, “You really don't know what to expect. I think [I'm] maybe a little less nervous [this time], but I'm just excited...It's such an amazing part of life.”\nReps tell People that the couple has welcomed another baby girl, saying, “Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl.”\nJonas discusses the “adjustment period” of work and family balance with People, admitting he's still “learning.”\n“It's an adjustment period,” Jonas said. “Just something that I'm learning as I go, I think I can now work a little bit harder to take time off. I'm still trying to figure it out. Some weeks are a little bit more challenging than others, but it makes it a lot easier when you enjoy your gig … I wake up every day just thrilled to be able to go make music or act and create different projects and have a beautiful family, so it feels like a dream come true.” \nTurner and Jonas attend the premiere of the singer's new movie Devotion at the Toronto International Film Festival, their first red carpet appearance since the birth of their second child.\nIn an interview with MR PORTER, Jonas explains why privacy in his relationship with Turner is so important.\n“I want to feel like an open book,” he said. “But when we started dating, I realized that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.”\nWhile talking with Ryan Seacrest, Jonas  said he asked Turner's dad for her hand in marriage, and it was nerve-wracking.\n“I was probably more nervous to ask her dad than I was to ask her,” he said. “You throw it out there, and you hope that the response is good. Luckily, it went well.”\nLater that month, Turner accompanied her husband as the Jonas Brothers received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During his speech at the ceremony, Jonas shouted Turner out by saying, “Sophie, what up homie. You're my partner in crime. You keep me motivated and inspired every day. I strive to be as cool as you. You got any plans after this?”\nHe then mentioned his daughters, saying, “To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back.”\nJonas and Turner had a very public date night, attending the Vanity Fair Oscar after-party together on March 12.\nTurner accidentally posted a video of her and Jonas' older daughter Willa briefly to her Instagram Story. She explained in a post after why she and Jonas still intend to keep their daughters' lives as private as possible. She wrote:\n“Earlier today I made an honest mistake accidentally posting a video of our daughter on instagram stories. We have always advocated for our kids’ rights to privacy so sharing this publicly is something that is against anything I stand for. Our children deserve the right to grow up out of the public eye, to learn and grow in private. If I ever were to post anything of our kids, know that it is unquestionably a mistake. I would greatly appreciate if anyone who has reposted on any other platform, please delete the video.”\nIn a lighter moment for the couple toward the end of May, Turner made a special appearance during Jonas' Chicken Shop Date video.\n\nTurner posted a birthday tribute to Jonas for his 34th birthday on August 15, featuring the couple in matching pajamas. “Happy birthday handsome,” she wrote, tagging Jonas.\nFans of the couple noted that they'd both been recently seen without their wedding rings during the first few days of September 2023. On September 2, Jonas shared a picture with his brothers on Instagram in which his wedding ring is visible.\nOn September 3, TMZ reported that the couple are seeking a divorce following six months of difficulty in their relationship. Jonas has supposedly reached out to lawyers and a source claims he has been responsible for the kids the last few months while on tour as Turner films in London. The couple also recently sold their mansion in Miami after buying it just a year ago, marking a season of change.\nOn September 5, Jonas filed for divorce in Miami, stating in court documents that “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.” The couple has a prenup in place, and Jonas requested joint custody of their two daughters.\nLater on September 5, sources spoke to People and Page Six about what led to Jonas and Turner’s split.\n“They were not separated but they’ve been living separate lives for months,” a source who knows the couple told People, adding that they spent the summer apart. “[They] haven’t gotten along in a while, but they’re hoping to resolve this all amicably.” \n“As far as custody goes, this literally all just happened, so they’re figuring it out in real time,” People’s source continued. “They did have a prenup. As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the U.K.”\nThe source added that their divorce does not come as a “surprise” to those who know them.\nPage Six spoke to a source close to the Jonas family, who described the divorce being the result of “many disagreements” just adding up.\n“Divorce was a last resort for Joe,” Page Six’s source said. “He never wanted to break up his family, but he had to take what he felt was the best course of action for his girls.”\n“An unhappy home isn’t a home, and the truth is that he and Sophie were going through it this year,” the source continued. “There’s a lot of noise out there, but it wasn’t a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back situation like it’s being reported. [The disagreements] just kept building, and Joe finally reached a point where he felt that he had exhausted all options to salvage the marriage.”\nDuring the morning, Jonas and Turner released a joint statement on their Instagram accounts confirming their separation. “After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” they said. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\nFans also noted that during his concert in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday, September 6, Jonas changed the lyrics to “Hesitate,” a song he wrote in honor of Turner.\n“Don’t be scared because I’m on her side,” Jonas sang in footage posted to social media. The original line was “Don’t be scared because I’m on your side.”\nHe stated in the Jonas Brothers’ 2020 documentary, Chasing Happiness, what the song was about.\n“‘Hesitate’ is a song I wrote. It’s like my vows before I wrote my vows. It’s my promise to Sophie,” he said. “I can see in the audience when it’s definitely those other people’s songs. I see couples holding each other. I see somebody, that song got them through something.”\nHe continued, “For me, it takes me to a whole other universe, I’m seeing her walk down the aisle again every time I close my eyes.”\nOn Saturday, September 9, Jonas seemed to walk back some of the statements that have been circulating about the split between himself and Turner. While on stage for a Jonas Brothers concert in Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium,  the singer stated, “I just wanna say, look: if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it. Okay? Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.”\n“It’s been a tough week,” Joe Jonas says at the Jonas Brothers’ Dodger Stadium Show. “I just wanna say, look: if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it. Okay? Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.” pic.twitter.com/6BW4ugrQ5N\nTurner filed a lawsuit in New York City on September 21, claiming that Jonas was withholding their two children’s passports and keeping them from their “habitual residence” of England. \nOutlets widely report on the court documents and all they revealed about Jonas and Turner’s relationship and how quickly their marriage dissolved. \nTurner claimed in them that she learned about Jonas filing for divorce through the media and that they had agreed in December 2022 to make England their “forever home.” She detailed how they had taken steps in the months after to make that transition. She also indicated her intent to file another suit in England for custody.\nJonas’ rep responded to her filing with a long statement to TMZ. The rep claimed that Jonas needs to keep the children in the U.S. so he does not violate his divorce filing in Florida. “The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children,” the rep said.\nAttorneys not associated with Turner and Jonas’ case told Page Six that due to their filing in two different jurisdictions, the matter isn’t likely to be resolved easily or quickly. “It’s going to be a long court battle,” New York trial lawyer Aaron Richard Golub said, adding it is one that “is going to swing like a pendulum.”\nOn Friday, September 22, actress Jessica Chastain reposted a tweet from author Roxane Gay. It read, “The way Joe Jonas miscalculated his popularity with his transparent attempts at PR manipulation, particularly when the North remembers is FASCINATING.”\nShe added, “And holding the children’s passports to keep them from their mother? Bruh. And the thing is, these are not people I know or follow. I just read the ‘news.’ He has handled this SO badly that now I’m paying attention.”\nChastain shared the first tweet, adding a reference to Gay as “The Oracle.”\nThe Oracle @rgay 🤍 https://t.co/RosjKuXW0m\nBoth Jonas and Turner signed an interim consent order that multiple media outlets obtained where they agreed to have their children remain in New York as they work through their custody case. The court agreement prohibits either from removing their daughters from the state. Page Six noted that the former couple is due to appear in court on October 3 for a pretrial conference.\nIn July, Jonas and Turner were looking to buy a property in Wallingford, England. As part of their attempt to close on the house, Jonas wrote a letter to the then-owner to persuade them to sell to the celebrity couple. \nThe letter was shared by Page Six, and it includes a rave review of living in the U.K. from Jonas.\n“When my wife and I decided we were going to spend more time in the UK and search for a permanent home, our daughter expressed three unwavering requirements: having chickens, a pony and a Wendy house,” the musician allegedly stated. “While many of the houses we viewed met this criteria, the moment we turned the corner and caught sight of the charming blue shutters adorning [redacted], we experienced a sense of magic unlike anything we had felt before.”\nHe went on to discuss how he and Turner would live in the house, building out a music studio and working on the garden.\n“We could tell that your family have truly loved living here and we can envision our children growing up here and making this our forever home,” the letter supposedly goes on. “I really think Sophie and I will be able to look after [redacted names] and for many years pay homage to the magic you have created here.” \nThe sale has not closed, and their divorce commenced two months after putting down a ten percent deposit on the property.\nJonas and Turner started their 4-day mediation for child custody and their divorce. A source told Page Six that Jonas was hopeful about the mediation going in. “Joe is committed to making it work with Sophie in mediation and doesn’t want to put up a fight—as long as they can come to a fair agreement on the kids,” the source said. No source associated with Turner spoke out on her perspective.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more. Her first book, The Lonely Hunter, will be released by Dial Press in February 2022.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "The Complete Timeline of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 21:31:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe last few years have seen a lot of enormous changes in the British Royal Family, an entity known more for tradition than rapid growth. After the loss of Queen Elizabeth II, who ruled over the U.K. most of the 21st century, some people may be looking for some stability. If there's any couple in the family who offers that, it's Prince William and Kate Middleton.\nWilliam and Kate have had what appears on the outside to be a bit of a fairytale romance, from the storybook wedding to the picturesque family of five they have now. Sure, the full details of that fairytale aren't known, and some of what's been shown may be in part to help the royal family's image. But optics aside, there’s something about them that has captivated people since the beginning of their relationship. Here’s a look back at their journey, from college sweethearts to royal power couple.\nPrince William and Kate Middleton meet while both studying at St. Andrews University in Scotland. Rumor has it that William was won over after seeing Kate modeling at a student fashion show for charity (a show for which he reportedly paid £200 for a front row seat).\nOther rumors suggest that her reason for being at St. Andrews was entirely related to meeting her future husband.\nThe Crown historian Robert Lacey wrote in his 2020 book Battle of Brothers: William and Harry—The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult, that Kate was trying to manifest her future relationship with William when she was only 19.\n“Kate was very strategic,” Lacey said. “She gave up her place at one of Britain’s premier universities, Edinburgh, and opted for another one [St. Andrews] that probably didn’t have the same academic standard. She had already been to Edinburgh to get her flat accommodations sorted out but switched universities and switched her courses to history of art because that was William’s. She delayed her own education by a year and even takes the chance she won’t get into St. Andrews.”\nShe was not the only person making these choices. Applications to the school reportedly went up by 44% after it was announced that was William's choice of university. They might not all have been marriage hopefuls, but some probably were like Kate.\nHello! magazine reported that Prince William was moving from his dorm into a flat with three college friends, one of them “a pretty 20-year-old brunette” who, as you might guess, turned out to be Kate Middleton.\nHe allegedly started out as just her friend, before seeing her walk in a fashion show in this see-through dress on March 26, 2002.\n“She’s there and about to walk down the runway on the fashion show, and she strips off an extra layer of clothing,” Lacey explained. “Here is a very strategic lady who knows what she wants and has got it.”\nThey began dating soon after.\nWilliam and Kate are photographed together for the first time during a ski trip in Klosters, causing then-Prince Charles to threaten to sever ties with The Sun, the outlet that published the photos. Charles was said to have been “very disappointed” by the breach in an agreement between the press and Buckingham Palace that ensures royal children can continue their education without having their privacy intruded upon.\nBoth William and Kate graduate from St. Andrews. The Middletons later share a photo of them together on the day.\nThe couple attend Camilla's daughter Laura Parker-Bowles’ wedding, marking one of their first big public appearances together, and sparking speculation that they were serious enough to one day walk down the aisle together themselves.\nIn 2007, William and Kate took a time-out and broke up for a couple months. Kate took a vacation to Ireland with her friends afterwards, while William awkwardly fielded questions about “how things are going” with Kate.\nKate later said in 2010 during an interview after their engagement that in hindsight, she thinks it was healthy for them to have time apart.\n“I think I at the time wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person...You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realized,” she said. “Or I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger. I really valued that time for me as well although I didn't think it at the time, looking back on it.\"\nBy July of that same year, rumors began to swirl about a possible reconciliation as Kate is seen attending a Princess Diana tribute concert—though she sat two rows behind William with her sister Pippa.\nThe two are seen together again, back where it all began: the ski slopes. Photos show Kate and William together in Klosters as sources told newspapers that they were very much back together.\nWilliam graduates from his RAF training, with Kate at his side.\nWilliam proposes to Kate while on a trip to Kenya, with Princess Diana’s sapphire engagement ring. “We had a little private time away together with some friends, and I just decided it was the right time really,” William later said in their engagement interview. “We'd been talking about marriage or a while, so it wasn't a massively big surprise, but I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya.”\nPrince William and Kate Middleton get married in a fairytale ceremony at Westminster Abbey witnessed by nearly 72 million people worldwide. The bride did her own makeup, the groom wore sweat pads so that he wouldn’t sweat out of his uniform, and Ellie Goulding performed at the reception.\nIn marrying William, Kate gained the title Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Strathearn, and Lady Carrickfergus.\nAfter the wedding, the married couple settle in Wales and adopt a dog, an English Cocker Spaniel named Lupo.\nSt. James’ Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with the couple’s first child. During her pregnancy, she’s hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness.\nKate gives birth to Prince George, and steps out for post-baby photos.\nKensington Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with their second child. Kate had not reached the 12-week stage, but the Palace made the announcement because they felt they couldn’t keep the pregnancy under wraps from the press for much longer. Once again, Kate suffers from extreme morning sickness.\nKate gives birth to Princess Charlotte, who becomes fourth in line for the throne after Prince Charles, her father Prince William, and her older brother Prince George. She’s also the first to take up the title of Princess in 25 years, and is the highest ranking female in line for the throne.\nThe coupled made their red carpet debut at the British Academy Film Awards, where Prince William presented a BAFTA Fellowship award to Mel Brooks. Kate wore an off-the-shoulder tiered Alexander McQueen gown in a floral print.\nKensington Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with the couple’s third child. As with her previous two pregnancies, she suffers from hyperemesis gravidarum.\nKate gives birth to Prince Louis, who is now fifth in line for the throne. Though tradition dictated that Louis, as a male, would overtake Princess Charlotte for a place on the throne, the policy was amended prior to George's birth with the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. That made Charlotte the first female royal to trump a younger male sibling.\nKate and Prince were front and center at the marriage of his little brother, Prince Harry, to Meghan Markle.\nThe couple helped Harry and Meghan celebrate on their wedding day at their nuptials at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, England. “William was in a jokey, wonderful mood at the party,” a wedding guest told People at the time, adding that Kate was also in “great form.”\nThey added, “She and William were saying how thrilled they were to have their children there taking part.”\nAt Princess Eugenie's wedding, Kate and William are seen showing each other a little affection. Eugenie was marrying her husband Jack Brooksbank when the royal couple were seen holding hands in the pew.\n#RoyalWedding Aaahhh! My heart! 💕💞💑😍😍😍😍 #DukeandDuchessofCambridge pic.twitter.com/Xup5ouu67a\nKate and William tend to be hands off when out in public.\nAfter lockdown began in the U.K., the couple spoke with the BBC in a rare joint interview, discussing what it's like to parent through a pandemic.\n“It's been ups and downs, like a lot of families self-isolating,” Kate said. “The children have got such stamina, I don't know how. Honestly, you get to the end of the day and you write down the list of all the things that you've done in that day. So, you pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day—they have had a lovely time—but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.”\nNine years after welcoming their cocker spaniel, Ludo, into their lives, the couple announced they had bid him farewell. They shared a handsome portrait of the dog on Instagram with a heartfelt goodbye.\n“Very sadly last weekend our dear dog, Lupo, passed away,” the post read. “He has been at the heart of our family for the past nine years and we will miss him so much. - W & C.”\nApril of 2021 was the 10-year anniversary of the couple's marriage, otherwise known as the tin anniversary. To celebrate, they shared some new portraits by Chris Floyd at Kensington Palace.\nThey also posted a video of themselves with their children walking through the sand dunes in Norfolk, England, thanking everyone for the well wishes on the occasion of their anniversary.\nQueen Elizabeth appoints Kate Middleton as a sponsor of the naval battleship HMS Glasglow. The office requires Kate to maintain a “strong and enduring personal connection to the vessel and her crew, often supporting milestones, events and deployments.”\n“Her Majesty the Queen has approved the appointment of my wife Catherine as Sponsor of the superb ship we see taking shape outside—HMS Glasgow,” Prince William said in the announcement. “I know that Catherine will be delighted to join you here in Glasgow for the naming ceremony in due course.” \nThe couple got all dressed up for the No Time to Die premiere in London, posing with Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. The royal family members were guests of honor at the event. \nKate wore a Jenny Packham capelet gown covered in gold sequins. \nKate and William enjoyed their first Earthshot Awards, at Alexandra Palace in London.

{"title": "All About Chris Evans’ Wife Alba Baptista", "date": "2023-10-05 21:38:00", "text": "On November 10, People's newest Sexiest Man Alive Chris Evans revealed that he has been dating 26-year-old actress Alba Baptista for at least a year and “it's serious,” according to a source, who added,“They are in love, and Chris has never been happier. His family and friends all adore her.”\nIn January 2023, a source reiterated that to Us Weekly, describing them as having “gotten serious.” On Valentine's Day 2023, Evans himself shared a very public look inside their private relationship. He posted a video of photos from time together to honor his girlfriend.\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/kixfEDiZWv\nAnd in September 2023, the couple quietly got married, People reported.\nHere, everything to know about Baptista and their relationship timeline so far.\nThe actress is best known for her role on Netflix's Warrior Nun, her English-language debut. \nBaptista is from Portugal and was born in Lisbon. She has starred in several popular Portuguese films and TV shows, including A Impostora, Filha da Lei, A Criação, and Jogo Duplo. After Warrior Nun, she starred in the 2022 dramatic comedy, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris.\nOutside of acting, she has a passion for charity work and in 2018, worked at an orphanage in Cambodia focusing on education. She also speaks five languages, including Spanish, French, German, English, and her native Portuguese.\nThe almost a year estimate is partially based on some fan detective work. The couple follows each other on Instagram, though they haven't yet gone “Instagram official” by sharing photos of each other. Cosmopolitan reported that Baptista's mom used the same pumpkins seen on Evans' Instagram as her profile photo for the social media platform, tipping off the sleuths. He has also been liking all of Baptista's photos since October 13, as well as a few back-dated ones from July of this year and August of 2021. \nIn his interview for the Sexiest Man issue, Evans didn't get too specific about who he wanted to settle down with, but he did talk about wanting to take things further in his romantic relationships than he has so far.\n“That's absolutely something I want: wife, kids, building a family,” Evans said. “When you read about most of the best artists, whether it's actors, painters, writers, most of them [admit] it wasn't the work they made [that they are most proud of], it was about the relationships; the families they created, the love they found, the love they shared.”\nHe continued, “So it's also something through my long 41 years that also rings true. Those things are the most important. I love the idea of tradition and ceremony. I had a lot of that in my life, so the idea of creating that—I can't think of anything better.”\nLater in January 2023, a source told Us Weekly that he and Baptista were very serious as a couple. “Chris and Alba have gotten serious,” the source said. “This is the most committed anyone can remember him being in a very long time, if not ever.” \n“They spend most of their time at his place in Massachusetts and love the quiet life there, surrounded by nature and away from the spotlight,” the source added. “Chris was very open that he wanted to take his time before settling down.”\nPeople reported that Evans and Baptista got married at a private estate in Cape Cod over the weekend of September 9 and 10, 2023. Evans’ Marvel co-stars were seen at the ceremony, including  Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, in addition to actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. The couple’s reps did not immediately confirm the wedding news.\nAllegedly yes, per Page Six. The outlet reported on September 12 that the couple would be having a ceremony in Portugal. “There is going to be a second gathering in Portugal for members of Alba’s family who couldn’t be in Massachusetts,” a source said. “Sometime this week, I believe. Then they’ll depart from Portugal for their honeymoon.”\nA source spoke to People on September 11 about how Evans knew quickly after meeting Baptista in Europe that she was the woman with whom he wanted to build a life.\nEvans “has been ready to settle down for a while. He can’t wait to have a family. He was just waiting for the right girl,” the source said. Baptista “is beautiful, smart and just a good person. She is involved in charity work and truly cares about doing good. She is a very positive and happy person. It’s rubbed off on him. It's the best news that they are married.”\n“They got serious very quickly,” the source said of their relationship.“He kept saying he knew she was the one.”\n“[He] has been the happiest since they met,” the source added. “[She is] everything to him.”\nYes. A source told Entertainment Tonight on September 13, 2023, “Chris has been in love with Alba for a while. They share a special connection and are so happy to be husband and wife. Chris is in a really great place in his life. He feels happy with his career and was ready to settle down. He’s thrilled about this new chapter and is so excited to have a family with Alba one day.”\nHis biggest was on Valentine's Day 2023. He shared multiple Instagram Stories featuring videos and photos of them together.\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/kixfEDiZWv\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/P0VxoMphAs\nEvans has kept their relationship mostly private. He did discuss Baptista briefly in his September 2023 GQ interview, when explaining why he has been acting less.\nIn 2022, he worked nonstop on three different movies, something he regrets. That’s when he brought Baptista up: “My girlfriend that I’ve had for a while, when we began dating, I was like: ‘Yeah, I do one movie a year. I try to never work now.’ And then, after like a few months of dating, boom, guess what? We’re living in Atlanta for a year. Get ready. And even when that year was happening, I was like, man, never again.” \nHe also offered a little about her personality when discussing the reporter’s energy: “My girlfriend’s really big into people’s energies and first impressions,” he said. “I’m not so much, because I feel that I don’t always give off the same thing out of the gate. So I try to really reserve judgment. But you had a very, very nice energy when you first came in.”\nApparently! A source told Page Six that Meghan and Harry, who were visiting Portugal in late September 2023, ran into Baptista and Evans at a bar or restaurant there. It was not planned, the insider said, describing the run-in as “completely coincidental.” The couples didn’t know each other prior but ended up hanging out.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "All About Ethan Slater, Ariana Grande’s New Boyfriend and <i>Wicked</i> Co-Star", "date": "2023-10-05 21:44:00", "text": "Just days after Ariana Grande's separation from her husband of two years, Dalton Gomez, was widely reported, news broke that Grande found love again...on the set of Wicked.\nGrande and her co-star Ethan Slater, who is also separated from his wife, started dating recently, as People, Entertainment Tonight, and TMZ reported on July 20, 2023. Slater and Grande's commonalities go beyond their work in Wicked, though: Both are Broadway alumni (Grande for her work in 13: The Musical, Slater for his in the Spongebob musical).\nHere's what to know about Slater and his history with Grande.\nSlater is a Gemini and celebrated his 31st birthday on June 2; he grew up in Washington, D.C. and attended Vassar College. His most high-profile role so far was starring as Spongebob in Broadway's SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical. It was a project he was involved in for years, starting when he was just 19.\n“Working on SpongeBob changed the way that I approach everything because I started working on it when I was 19, and it was seven years of development—from starting development until closing on Broadway,” he told Pop-Culturalist.com in August 2021. So it was like my full education, which is awesome. We approached it from this perspective, which came from [director] Tina [Landau], that this isn’t a show that is talking down to kids. This is a show that is funny; it’s funny, it’s visually stimulating, it’s physical humor. Kids like it because it taps into this optimism and heart; and adults like it because it taps into things they remember from their childhood. But it’s not a show that is solely designed for kids. It was meant to make us laugh while we were making it.”\nBoq notably has a big crush on Grande's character Glinda in Wicked. Slater and Grande have been shooting the film adaptation in the U.K. since December. Slater's casting in Wicked was announced in December 2022.\n.@ethansaslater has joined the @wickedmovie as Boq! https://t.co/hkOCQBVZCb\nBoth Slater and Grande are newly single after being married. People reported that Slater and his wife Lilly Jay were separated after news of his dating Grande broke on July 20. Jay and Slater started dating in 2012 and got married in November 2018. They welcomed their first child, a son, in August 2022.\nSlater celebrated Jay this Mother's Day on his Instagram account. He wrote, “Happy first Mother’s Day to the most loving caring and wonderful mom/person in the world. - from me and this little guy.” Grande had liked the post.\nHe also posted a tribute to her in November 2022, writing, “My best friend. 4 years married, 10 years together. And this is easily the best (and most *bizarre*) year yet.” Grande liked that post too.\nOn Saturday, July 22, a source who knows Lilly told ET that the new mother is “devastated” and that “this is not the future she had in mind.”\nThey added, “She's doing her best to get back on her feet. She's incredibly smart and driven...she is truly the best mother.”\nSlater had a public Instagram account when reports initially broke of his and Grande's dating. But shortly after the news stories spread, Slater went private on his Instagram. He had already limited comments on some posts beforehand.\nAfter filing for divorce from his wife Lilly Jay in late July and spending a month laying low, Slater returned to Instagram at the beginning of September to promote his role in Spamalot on Broadway.\nGrande liked the image in a show of support that got media attention.\n\nA source told People, “Ariana and Dalton separated in January. She and Ethan recently began dating, and he is separated from his wife.”\nUs Weekly received similar intel from its source: “Ariana and Ethan are dating; however things are fairly new. Ariana and Dalton split in January, and Ethan is separated from his wife. Ariana and Ethan have only recently begun seeing each other but they have a lot of fun together and are enjoying each other’s company.”\nEntertainment Tonight's source also stressed that this is very recent: “Ariana and Ethan recently started dating. They have a lot in common and have a lot of fun,” the source said. “They didn't start dating until both were broken up with their significant others. Ariana and Dalton remain friends.”\nTMZ, meanwhile, reported that Slater and Grande had been dating “several months ago during production” of Wicked, per its multiple sources. The insiders stressed that Slater and Grande did not start dating until after they were separated from their spouses. They were photographed sitting next to each other while celebrating Wicked co-star Michelle Yeoh's Oscar win in March.\nOn July 28, a source emphasized to ET that Slater and Grande started as friends, saying, “Ariana and Dalton both realized they were very different people and quietly separated earlier this year. Ariana and Ethan connected as friends first because they have a lot in common and many similar interests.” \n“While this entire situation has been blown out of proportion, it’s much different than what has been portrayed in public,” a friend close to the couple told People. “They are just trying to navigate their new relationship in private.”\nAnother source added, “They are doing their best to balance the fact that they are in the public eye with the desire to be respectful to all parties involved.”\nA source alleged to the Daily Mail in September 2023 that things had escalated between Grande and Slater, and they were living together in New York City as Slater prepares for his Spamalot role on Broadway. Neither Grande nor Slater confirmed the rumor.\nOn October 4, a source told Us Weekly the same. They said, “Ethan informed his friends and soon-to-be ex-wife [Lilly Jay] that he’s living with Ariana full-time in New York. They’re really happy and really good for each other. All of her friends love him.”\nIn an August 2021 interview with Pop-Culturalist.com, Slater discussed how he co-wrote the musical Edge of the World based on that loss. “One of the big things is the mining [of] my personal experience for writing,” he said. “When I was 7 years old, my mom died, and so that’s been a really big, formative thing in my life. She had left this huge imprint on me, even though I had so few memories. And that’s what happens to this character, Ben. He grows up not knowing his mom, being raised by a single dad, and yet the impact she has on his life and his life trajectory is immeasurable. So those are the two inspirational elements that came together.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "All About Dylan Meyer, Kristen Stewart’s Screenwriter Fiancée", "date": "2023-10-05 21:56:00", "text": "As Kristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer’s relationship continues way past the two-year mark, things between them are stronger than ever—to the point where they’re ready to get married. On November 2, 2021, Stewart revealed the two are engaged to Howard Stern, and Meyer popped the question.\n“We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”\nIt’s a decidedly new chapter for Stewart, who opened up in a recent issue of InStyle about being “sort of cagey” in previous relationships. Meyer and Stewart were first romantically linked in summer 2019, but the couple actually met six years before on a movie set, Stewart told Howard Stern last November. They later reconnected at a birthday party for a mutual friend. “The day that I met her, all bets were off,” Stewart remembered. “I was like, ‘Where have I been and how have I not known you?’ She's been, like, living in LA alongside my life somehow but not ever converging?”\nThe actress even told the radio host that she was ready to propose in November 2019, two years before it actually happened. \nIn July 2021, the two even sparked secret marriage rumors when they were photographed wearing rings on their left ring fingers, although they never even announced they were engaged. In September 2021, the two were photographed together again, signaling their relationship remains on and strong.\nAhead, everything we know about Meyer, including her screenwriting career and how she paid tribute to Stewart during her birthday and Valentine's Day in 2023.\nStewart told Stern that she met Meyer on a movie set six years ago. While she didn't specify which one, Meyer has written and co-starred in multiple films and TV shows. She co-wrote and executive produced the 2016 Netflix movie XOXO, starring Sarah Hyland. She penned episodes of the sci-fi series Miss 2059. Meyer also wrote the short films Loose Ends (2015) and Rock Bottom (2019), which you can watch right here:\nAs for her acting credits, Meyer has appeared in short films including The Death and Return of Superman (2011), Wrestling Isn't Wrestling (2015), and Jem Reacts to the New Jem and the Holograms Trailer (2015). \nRumors about Meyer and Stewart's relationship began in August 2019 when the pair was seen kissing on a New York City stoop. The sighting came less than a month after Stewart was photographed kissing on-off girlfriend Stella Maxwell on a yacht in Italy. A source told E! at the time that while \"it will always be very easy for Kristen to fall back with Stella,\" she's focused on her new relationship with Meyer. \n\"Kristen is spending time with Dylan and very happy about it,\" the insider told E! News. \"She was seeing Stella for a little bit while it worked, but now she has moved on with Dylan.\" The source added, \"Kristen isn't holding back at all and loves being with her. They are moving quickly and always together.\"\nStewart confirmed the fast-paced nature of their romance during her November interview with Stern, revealing to him that she told Meyer she loved her two weeks into dating. \"It was like really late, and we were in some shitty bar, and her friends were there or whatever, and they like walked out, and I was just like, 'Oh man, I’m so f*cking in love with you. Done,'\" she recalled. \"It wasn't like a thing, and also it was like so obvious. It just is.\" Stewart later added of their connection,  \"We're both from L.A. and we really love L.A. We're both kind of like, scumbags. We both felt like trolls as kids. We're so similar but different. She's a writer; she's brilliant.\"\nAlthough Stewart herself doesn't have a public Instagram, Meyer shared a first glimpse into the couple's relationship last October. She posted a black-and-white snap of a polaroid where the couple can be seen kissing. \"Find me under the covers hiding from the happiness police. 🖤,\" she captioned the post.\nSix months later, Meyer shared a birthday tribute for Stewart on the 'gram, writing, \"It’s my absolute favorite person's birthday and I’m wishing everyone the volume of beautiful feeling I feel toward her. It's a short ride on this earth, spend your time with someone that inspires you to be the best version of yourself and lights your shit on fire.\"\nWhen Meyer isn't gushing about Stewart, her social media is filled with a ton of nature and animal photos. You'll find pictures of her cats Zsa Zsa and Snack in various scenarios, as well as outdoor shots from around Los Angeles.\nThe couple may keep their romance private, but that doesn't mean things aren't serious between them. During her November 2019 interview with Stern, Stewart got very candid about her feelings toward Meyer. She told Stern that she \"can't f*cking wait\" to propose to Meyer and said she would \"absolutely\" get married. \n\"Yeah, I want to be, like, somewhat reasonable about it, but I think good things happen fast,\" Stewart continued, telling Stern she has a plan for how she'll pop the question. \"I can't say right now, because she'll find out.\" Stewart also said that her matrimony plans weren't \"tied to any weird sort of convention; it's just, like, when you know, you know.\"\nMeyer and Stewart kept a low-profile during stay-at-home orders but made made a rare outing in June 2020 for a coffee run in L.A. The Daily Mail captured photos of the couple wearing casual gray and black outfits, masks, and sunglasses while on their errand.  \nThe outlet also published photos of the couple participating in a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles earlier this month, following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and others at the hands of police. \nSources told  E! in October 2020 that Stewart and Meyer attended an intimate baby shower for Emma Roberts and Garrett Hedlund. (Stewart and Hedlund co-starred together in 2012's On the Road.) They joined the likes of Camilla Morrone (Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend) and Lily Kershaw to celebrate the upcoming arrival of Roberts and Hedlund's son.\nStewart, who next stars in the LGBTQ holiday rom-com Happiest Season, doesn’t have a ’gram. However, she used her girlfriend’s platform to urge people to vote in the upcoming election. “I turned the mic over to Kristen because she had some things to say and doesn’t have her own account. Happy #nationalvoterregistrationday!” Meyer captioned a selfie of Stewart in a “VOTE” tee on September 22. Kristen wrote, via Meyer's account:\nMeyer also shared a black-and-white photo of herself and Stewart to encourage voting. “I think I might chew my fingers off from nerves today but here’s a sweet photo @lindseybyrnes took. I really hope you vote. There are lots of crucial issues on your ballot besides the presidency and your voice truly does make a difference. The opportunity to have a say in the laws that govern you is precious, please don’t waste it,” she captioned the snap.\nOn April 9, Stewart’s 31st birthday, she and Meyer were out grocery shopping (masked). \nShe also posted on Instagram to celebrate her girlfriend’s birthday. \n“Life sure is sweeter with this cute little family,” she wrote. “Happy birthday, kiddo. You knock my socks off.”\nLaineyGossip pointed out that Stewart and Meyer were photographed at LAX in July 2021 wearing rings on their left ring finger. The two never confirmed wedding rumors or that Stewart even proposed to Meyer at this point. Meyer and Stewart, throughout their relationship, have managed to keep most details private and out of the limelight.\nOn November 2, Stewart told Howard Stern that Meyer popped the question.\n“We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”\nDuring her appearance on Stephen Colbert's talk show, Stewart addressed wedding planning—and how they may just elope. “I want to have a big party or something,” she said. “I’m so unceremonial. I think we might just go do it this weekend or something, I don't know, and then, like, just hang out with everyone afterwards,” Stewart said.\nIt isn’t often Stewart and Meyer's private life with friends is documented on social media, but Ashley Benson gave the world a rare glimpse into their dynamic in January 2022. The former Pretty Little Liars actress shared a group shot of Stewart and Meyer alongside each other and friends at Disneyland. “Family trips to Disney @cjromero @spillzdylz @sweetsuzieq @michael,” Benson captioned the shot, tagging Meyer's Instagram.\nStewart is nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars this year, and ahead of the ceremony, Meyer joined Stewart on the events circuit. On March 8, Meyer attended the Oscars nominee luncheon with Stewart and The Hollywood Reporter’s Oscar nominees night. Meyer matched her outfits to Stewart’s for both events, wearing a black Alessandra Rich mini dress for the luncheon and a white tank in the evening.\nThe two then attended the Critics’ Choice Awards together, where Stewart was nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Princess Diana in Spencer. At the show, Stewart wore a nude, glittery Dolce & Gabbana gown with Messika jewelry and Jimmy Choo shoes and Meyer wore a complimentary white August Getty Atelier and Chanel ensemble.\nStewart spoke this month about how blessed she feels having her personal life and career thrive at the same time. “I’m living a simulation, it’s too good,” Stewart told E!. “You run through the list, and I go, like, is that possible? Right now, I’m definitely feeling it. It’s not lost on me any second of any day. I will tell you that.”\nTo top off an eventful awards season, Meyer and Stewart stepped out together at the 2022 Academy Awards, where Stewart is nominated for Best Actress for her role in Spencer. The duo, matching in black and white suits, posed together in the red carpet and engaged in some PDA in front of the cameras. They held hands as photos snapped and shared a quick kiss before Meyer let Stewart pose solo. \nKristen Stewart and at fiancée Dylan Meyers share a kiss on the red carpet at the #Oscars. https://t.co/abMq1BYSsP pic.twitter.com/5FObv4pm1D\nOn Saturday, December 3, the pair were spotted tooling around Los Angeles in their Dodge van like any suburban couple. They were headed to a friend's house and dressed comfortably for the afternoon. Stewart was behind the wheel and smoking a cigarette as she navigated the quiet streets. The Twilight actress was wearing black Adidas sweatpants with white stripes and a black sports bra under a hoodie. She paired the look with white Nike sneakers and sunglasses. After being a blonde for quite a while, Stewart has gone brunette with a short chop. \nMeyer was also dressed casually and in sunglasses. Sunday, December 4, was Meyer's 35th birthday, so there may have been fancier plans ahead for the couple. \nWhile the pair have kept their relationship mostly under the radar, Meyer posted a tribute to Stewart on her Instagram on February 14, 2023. Meyer wrote: “One time I turned a hundred dollars into fourteen hundred dollars at a casino in Pittsburgh. I was playing craps (my first time ever) and when it was my turn at the dice I didn’t roll a seven for forty five minutes straight. Strangers were getting rich off of my hot streak, tipping me chips and tequila shots. Cheering for me, clapping me on the back. Calling their gambling addicted friends/co-workers/ex-wives to regale them with my extraordinary feat. I was the hero of the people, an instant legend. Bennie and the Jets was playing. My hair looked great, too. And even this, the clear peak of my short time on earth, does not remotely come close to how it feels to spend a Monday night in sweatpants with you, valentine.”\nOn April 9, 2023, Meyer took to Instagram to share her love for Stewart again in honor of the actress' birthday. Meyer wrote, “Cheers to my favorite Shrimp on her birthday! Sweetheart, I love you more than all the shades of green, all the phases of the moon, all the cats in LA. Love you more than chunking express, or Denis Johnson’s already dead, or the stooges’ raw power. I love you more than a dominos pizza when you’re stoned, a Ricky’s fish taco when you’re hungover, and EVEN more than a plate of wings ~ hot and extra crispy ~ from rustic, aka the pinnacle of my capacity to love. Some might say that’s too much love but I say those people are squares. Go big or go home! Happy birthday dude I love you so much.”\nMeyer and Stewart continued to keep their relationship mostly private during summer 2023, although paparazzi captured the couple grabbing dinner with friends on August 4, 2023 in Los Angeles.\nMeyer herself last posted a shot of her with Stewart on Instagram in June:\nMeyer and Stewart kept a low profile through September. Paparazzi captured them getting lunch together Little Dom’s in Los Angeles on October 2 though. Both matched in blue looks, with Stewart wearing a light blue cardigan with a white top and light-wash jeans. Meyer was in khaki pants, an open navy blue button-up, and a white top.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Zendaya and Tom Holland’s Romantic Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 21:59:00", "text": "Spider-Man: No Way Home co-stars Zendaya and Tom Holland finally confirmed they are in a romantic relationship after years of off and on rumors that they were dating. They've been playing love interests Peter Parker and MJ in the franchise since 2017, but met on set in 2o16. They've obviously been close, but it was in July of 2021 that the paparazzi caught them kissing at a stop light, giving those rumors some more legitimacy. \nThe couple still plays their personal lives very privately, but these are the notable moments in the timeline of their relationship so far. \nHolland was the first to post a photo of Zendaya, but soon they were appearing on one another's Instagram feeds regularly. In July 2016, he shared a pic of them with another friend at the pool, captioned, “Summer Sunday's.”\nZendaya posted their shared Hollywood Reporter cover just a few months later, writing, “Amidst all the chaos and sadness...this one good thing did happen to me today. Honored to share it with the very best...Spider-Man himself.” \nHolland and Zendaya's chemistry onscreen transferred easily to the red carpet, and photos of them being playful with one another at the San Diego Comic-Con were widely circulated by fans.\nIn May 2017, they start attending events together, possibly because of promotional opportunities, but photos taken of them show a more personal relationship, like this photo from the MTV Movie and TV Awards.\nThroughout the month, they're frequently photographed together as they promote Spider-Man, but it seems like the easy chemistry of two familiar colleagues. \nIn July 2017, a source confirms to People magazine that they are together.\n“They started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man,” the source said. “They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye, but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.”\nA second insider added, “They’re both really ambitious, and they challenge each other—but, most importantly, they make each other crack up. They seem to have a really similar sense of humor and love joking around together. They have great banter back and forth.” \nBefore the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere in June, Holland was gushing to People about his friendship with Zendaya, saying, “We are like the best of friends. She’s so great and amazing. I’m a little worried [about dealing with fame … [but] Zendaya is super famous and she’s been through this and I just call her up and say, ‘How do I manage being famous?’ I’m very glad I have a friend like her.”\nThe pair addressed the dating rumors above by tweeting to one another about the idea they've gone on vacation together.\n“Wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on a vacation in years! hbu?” Zenday wrote to Holland.\nHe joked back, “Does the press tour count?”\n@Zendaya Does the press tour count 😂😝 https://t.co/2WsstZPyde\nThe next month, Zendaya denied the rumors again in an interview with Variety.\n“We are friends,” she said. “He’s a great dude. He’s literally one of my best friends. This past how many months we’ve had to do press tours together. There’s very few people that will understand what that’s like at 20 years old.” \nThe next month, Zendaya told fans she'd been cheated on in the past and why it left her a bit skeptical about relationships early in life. The actress is currently 25-years-old, so at the time she was just out of her teen years.\n“I’m so anti being in a committed relationship when you’re young and people are learning and growing, because when people are young, they make bad decisions sometimes because they don’t know any better,” she explained. “It doesn’t mean they don’t know the difference between right and wrong—it just means that they’re still in the experimental phase in their life where they haven’t made the right decisions yet…it’s very hard to be in a relationship when the both of you are still figuring out life. You cannot change anybody. You cannot make someone grow up faster than they’re supposed to.”\nAt this point, Holland has met Zendaya's parents, meeting them at a steakhouse in New York.\nIn March 2018, the two stars sat together at the Oscars, though they walked the carpet separately. They were seen later that month at a comic book store in Los Angeles.\nZendaya attended the Met Gala, wearing a Joan of Arc-inspired chainmail Versace gown, and Holland posted a photo of her to his Instagram writing, “All hail the queen. Killing it mate.”\nThe next month, Zendaya posted a video of Holland goofing off with a lightsaber to wish him a happy birthday. She captioned the video: “Happy birthday loser…” \nIn September, Holland celebrated Zendaya's birthday with a paparazzi photo from their date at the comic book store and a statue of Spider-Man. \n“Me, myself and the birthday girl. Happy birthday mate - keep killing it and paving the way for the rest of us,” he wrote adding a heart. (Seems like he likes calling her “mate” a lot.)\nBut then a few days later, Skai Jackson’s mother said on Instagram that they are, in fact, a couple.\n“Yes. It's true. They been on the low for a while,” she wrote.\nShe then denied she was the commenter using her screen name., “Nothing posted or said was me. I could [sic] care less or know who was dating who. Please stop asking.” Okay then!  \nHolland and Zendaya begin their Spider-Man: Far From Home press tour, and when Holland posts an Instagram of himself, Zendaya, and co-star Jacob Batalon, he accidentally tags her name in a very suggestive place.\n“I'm assuming because you don't know how to work ig, that's the reasoning behind my name placement,” she commented with five laughing emojis.\nHolland  edits the tag and writes, “Thanks @zendaya for making me aware of my obvious blunder.” \nHolland shoots down the Zendaya dating rumors again. The actor tells ELLE in an interview that he is single and not romantically involved with anyone. He admits he is “definitely a relationship person. I’m not the fleeting type at all; it’s not my way of life.”  \nZendaya is seen with her Euphoria costar Jacob Elordi and they  are spotted together on vacation in Greece. Again, Zendaya never confirms she's dating Elordi, but paparazzi did catch Elordi giving her a kiss in New York City in February 2020. By September of that year, Elordi seems to be dating Kaia Gerber (but they broke up in November 2021.)\nTom Holland appears to go Instagram official with his girlfriend Nadia Parkes, who he was supposedly spending lockdown with in London. \nThen, two years after denying they're a couple, the Spider-Man co-stars were spotted together in Holland's car sharing a kiss at a red light in LA. They were then seen in the Silver Lake neighborhood the same day, leaving Zendaya's mother Claire Stoermer's residence. \nHolland and Zendaya are photographed at a friend's wedding for an Instagram story. In the photo, Zendaya is leaning into Holland and he has his hand on her sleeve in an intimate gesture. \n📸 | NEW picture of Tom Holland and Zendaya at a friends wedding tonight most likely in Oakland. Via: estebancamarillo Instagram stories pic.twitter.com/spFCMu4w1v\nTom Holland shares a mirror selfie of himself with Zendaya on the set of Spider-Man, captioning it, “My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays. Gimme a call when your [sic] up xxx.” \nLater that month, Zendaya posts photos of herself on the red carpet for the Venice Film Festival in her Balmain dress, looking stunning. Holland commented with three flame emojis, because she's definitely looking hot hot hot.\nHolland once again posts Zendaya to his timeline, this time with a photo of her on the red carpet for Dune, captioned with a hearts-eye emoji.\nA day later, Zendaya was also promoting Dune, this time with co-star Timothée Chalamet. The pair were testing one another's friendship knowledge for a BuzzFeed video when Chalamet was asked who Zendaya's biggest crush is. \n“Easy, Tom Holland!” Chalamet answers immediately, setting Zendaya off into a fit of giggles.\nIn an interview with GQ, Tom Holland talks to about relationships and the importance of privacy.\n“One of the downsides of our fame is that privacy isn’t really in our control anymore, and a moment that you think is between two people that love each other very much is now a moment that is shared with the entire world,” Holland said. \nZendaya told the outlet something similar, saying, “The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own.…I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.”\nDuring the London photo call for Spider-Man: No Way Home, Holland is  interviewed and points to Zendaya, saying, “There she is—looking beautiful, might I add.”\nOn December 13, the Los Angeles premiere of the film includes this adorable moment when Holland sees Zendaya walk in and gets stopped in his tracks. They do look stunning together on the red carpet, too.\nLater that week, Zendaya posted photos of Holland as Spider-Man at two different ages, writing, “My Spider-Man, I’m so proud of you, some things never change and good thing.”\nZendaya came to meet Holland's family in London, attending with his brothers Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on West End on January 22. The next day, Holland and Zendaya were at Holland's family's house in casual clothing.\nTom Holland and Zendaya seen in New York City as Holland promoted his new film Uncharted, and held hands as they left their hotel together. Matching in dark tones, Zendaya wore a belted gray shirt dress while Holland wore a light gray suit and black top. Both wore black masks amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nLater that month, Holland flew to Rome to surprise Zendaya with a date at Antica Pesa in the city’s Trastevere neighborhood, Page Six reported. Multiple sources told the outlet about the couple’s date, which started at 7 P.M. there and went until 10:30 P.M.\nOne eyewitness said, “She seemed visibly thrilled. They sat in a corner by the fireplace and were adorable together. They looked in love.” Insiders described the two as being “in deep conversation” there.\n“Zendaya looked stunning, even as simply dressed as she was. They are adorable together,” the source said, adding they were later joined by friends. “[They] laughed all night while being cute with each other.”\nThe restaurant shared a photo of Zendaya and Holland with chef Francesco Panella on its Instagram. \n“Thank you @tomholland2013 for coming back again to @anticapesa for your surprise night with @zendaya & friends,” he captioned the shot.\nHolland also traveled to Boston to visit Zendaya as she was shooting the romantic drama The Challengers in the city, Boston.com reported. The couple were seen having a coffee day date together at Tatte on Boylston Street. Zendaya was dressed down in a white top and glasses, and in one shot shared on Instagram, was seen looking adoringly at her partner:\nGreat Day in BostonSaw @Zendaya and @TomHolland1996 casually having a day in the city. Y’all take care and I’ll see you around. pic.twitter.com/OPE0CDehW8\nIn early September, Zendaya celebrated her her 26th birthday in Manhattan with Holland at MAMO Italian restaurant. The actress looked casual and chic in low-waisted denim jeans and a black crop top with long sleeves and a V-neck, which was held together with a few buttons in front. Zendaya dressed the outfit up a bit with suede pumps and a pair of diamond earrings and a pendant. \nHolland arrived at the restaurant in a blue plaid button-down, dark teal pants, and white sneakers. They were joined by several of Zendaya's co-stars, including her Euphoria cast mate Hunter Schafer. Zendaya's mother Claire Stoermer was also in attendance. \nLater in September, Zendaya spoke about Holland when she was interviewed by E! News just after winning an Emmy Award for her performance as Rue on Euphoria. After they asked who she texted first after winning she replied, “Well, I didn't have to text my mom because my mom was already there, she's here tonight, which is very special. And I texted my boyfriend.”\nZendaya and Tom Holland visited the Louvre in Paris, walking hand-in-hand through the famous museum's galleries. They were both dressed casually for their day out, Zendaya wearing a large light blue blouse with her sleeves rolled up, her hair up in a bun with a few curling tendrils around her face. She wore a pair of glasses for the tour, a black bag, and carried a small camera.\nHolland was in a white and black striped shirts with long sleeves and black pants, his short hair tousled. Zendaya was in the city for Paris Fashion Week, which ended on October 4. \nJust before Thanksgiving, a source tells US Magazine that the two Spider-Man stars are getting closer all the time and seem “serious and permanent.”\n“They’re both in settling-down mode and are absolutely planning for a real future together,” the source added.\nAfter taking a break from social media over the summer, fans noted Holland's exploring Instagram again. A fan edit of Zendaya looking fantastic in a million outfits was popular on the algorithm, and it eventually reached her boyfriend. The clip is captioned, “just zendaya owning the camera,” and clearly he agreed because he hit the like button.\nFans noted his “heart” on the images and were thrilled to see he is as in love as ever.\nEarlier that month, they made an appearance on Instagram together after Holland accompanied Zendaya on a visit to her old high school in Oakland. Pictures of the meet-and-greet were shared by her theatre teacher Tavia Percia.\nNeither Zendaya nor Holland attend any award season shows with each other, but during Oscars weekend, the couple is seen in London, where Holland's family is based, and days later together at a grocery store in the city.\nFans noticed later that month that Zendaya was wearing a ring with Holland's initials. They also noted that Holland has been wearing pants with a “Z” initial on the back pocket in sweet sartorial tributes to each other.\nZendaya spotted wearing an engraved gold ring with boyfriend, Tom Holland’s, initials in her manicurist’s Instagram story. pic.twitter.com/Vbw9pMYLNw\nIn May, the couple were visiting Venice together, and photographed getting into a private boat as they left the Gritti Palace hotel. Holland was wearing khaki pants and a white button down with the top button open to reveal a thin gold chain. His girlfriend wore a grey body-hugging knit dress with a thigh slip under a black jacket. On her feet were matching black leather boots, and she was also wearing a gold necklace for the Italian outing. Holland got into the boat ahead of his girlfriend and she navigated it a bit more slowly.\nTom Holland joked about his “rizz” during a BuzzFeed, slang for “charisma,” and why he's glad he already has a girlfriend.\n“I'm happy and in love, so I've got no need for rizz,” he said. “I have no rizz whatsoever; I have limited rizz... I need you to fall in love with me, really, for it to work.”\nHe added, “So, long game. Probably making a movie with each other — it definitely helps when the characters are falling in love with one another; you can sort of blur the lines a little bit.”\nHe also shared that his girlfriend Zendaya was was also his childhood celebrity crush.\n“Zendaya. Easily,” he replied after they asked for names.\nHolland appeared that same month in a cover story for The Hollywood Reporter, and he discussed why the couple keeps their life private. It's partyly because they are “two very busy people.”\n“Our relationship is something that we are incredibly protective of and we want to keep as sacred as possible,” he explained. “We don’t think that we owe it to anyone, it’s our thing, and it has nothing to do with our careers.”\nHe also joked about how his Spider-Man co-star sends him constant content on social media.\n“She sends me too much, it's like, I can't keep up,” Holland said. “I delete my Instagram for days at a time. I download it to post and then I have to check my messages, and I'll have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things from her.”\nOn the July 3 episode of the Wondery podcast Smartless, Holland spoke with hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett about why he and Zendaya work so well.\n“I'm lucky that I have someone like Zendaya in my life,” Holland said. “It's interesting being in a romantic relationship with someone that is in the same boat as you.”\nHe continued, “You can share your experiences and all that sort of stuff — and that's worth its weight in gold.”\nZendaya spoke to ELLE about whether fan liking her and Holland as a couple so much makes it easier to accept the public’s interest in them.  \n“Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public,” she replied. “I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share. It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now.”\nFor Zendaya’s 27th birthday on September 1, Holland shared a tribute to her on his Instagram Story. “My birthday girl 😍,” he captioned a shot of her getting ready to scuba dive.\nZendaya and Holland spent some time cuddling up with newborn puppies in early October...and Holland shared an Instagram grid post from the outing featuring both him and his girlfriend. “Puppies,” he captioned it. “🫠🥺,” Zendaya commented.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "With <i>Thank You For Coming</i>, Bhumi Pednekar Breaks Free (And Gets It On)", "date": "2023-10-06 13:45:00", "text": "The star of the heartfelt Indian sex comedy understands the film’s intent isn’t to scandalize; it’s to unite. \nBhumi Pednekar knew something was different this time. When the Indian producer Rhea Kapoor first pegged the actress as the potential lead for a new, provocative Hindi-language film, the pandemic was at its peak, an in-person meeting out of the question. But Kapoor insisted they couldn’t discuss the project over the phone; she needed to see Pednekar’s face when the elevator pitch reached her ears. Bemused, Pednekar joined the producer on Zoom, where Kapoor laid out the logline, along with a juicy non-sequitur: “Okay, don’t freak out.”\nThe film she presented that day was Thank You For Coming, about the trials and triumphs of Kanika Kapoor, a 32-year-old Indian woman who’s never once experienced an orgasm—though certainly not for lack of trying. But the sex comedy would cover more ground than its billing might suggest: the complexities of female friendship and betrayal; the long shadow of adolescent slut-shaming; the pressure to pop out babies (and still love sex!); the lure and the pitfalls of marriage in an era where so little seems certain, least of all our own commitments. Pednekar agreed to listen to a narration of the script, and was tearing up by the time it had finished.\n“Look, in my part of the world, a lot of comedies for women aren’t written,” she tells me over the phone as her car zips through Mumbai, a few days ahead of Thank You For Coming’s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Already a well-established, award-winning actress in India, Pednekar’s frequently jumped between genres, from drama to action to comedy, “but it’s never been front-footed comedy, and it’s never been a comedy that’s written by women, a film that’s being produced by a woman.”\nThat, and the subject matter was simply too rich to resist. “Female desire, female sexuality makes people very, very uncomfortable,” she says with relish. “But I love making people uncomfortable. I love making myself uncomfortable.”\nAfter her film debut in 2015 with Dum Laga Ke Haisha (released internationally as, yes, My Big Fat Bride), Pednekar achieved notoriety in films that cast her as rural women, including in action flicks like Sonchiriya, as well as 2019’s biographical drama Saand Ki Aankh, in which she played the real-life elderly sharpshooter Chandro Tomar. (“Suddenly these films were working, and I was bombarded with them–which is when I figured I needed to switch,” she told Grazia India in September.) She wanted to prove she could do something based in her own world: Thank You For Coming offered a departure from her earlier small-town stories, as Kanika would be a Delhi food blogger with a background not entirely unlike Pednekar’s own.\nIn Thank You For Coming—now playing in select theaters—many of Kanika’s hold-ups about sex and marriage stem from the bullying she was subjected to as a teenager. Her gynecologist mother (played in the film by Natasha Rastogi) gave birth to Kanika out of wedlock; she refused to marry Kanika’s father and chose, instead, to raise her as an independent businesswoman and a single parent. Even in Delhi, this choice gave way to the neighbors’ ire. \nDespite her tendency to try on boyfriends like costumes, Kanika can never settle into a relationship that seems to satisfy both parties, literally or figuratively. (Case in point: She loses her virginity in a Lightning McQueen bed.) Instead, she’s unceremoniously dumped on more than one occasion, and stuck drunkenly bickering with her mother and her grandmother, indulging in intergenerational butting-of-heads as the former urges her independence and the latter her stability. Mercifully, it’s Kanika’s girlfriends who are the first to hear when—after one fateful, booze and neon-soaked engagement party—Kanika finally achieves climax. The only issue is, when she wakes the next morning, she isn’t sure whom to thank. Her bumbling betrothed, Jeevan (Pradhuman Singh Mall)? Her ex-boyfriend? Or—shit—that one sweets vendor she was eyeing after a few drinks?\nThe “what happened last night” caper is about as unique a trope as the “awkward-guy-gets-hot-girl” (often, they’re one and the same), but Pednekar’s comedic intuition and uninhibited physicality make Thank You For Coming not only funny, but freeing. There’s remarkably little material in the film designed specifically to scandalize; the message is not one of goading but of guiding. After all, how many of our own wild-night anecdotes have ultimately transformed into poignant wisdom, passed between friends and lovers, mothers and daughters, the once-profane now practically sacred? \nIt’s a tradition Pednekar knows well, having been raised by her single mother after her father died of cancer 12 years ago. “If she didn’t have the female friendships that she has in her life, I think my life would have definitely shaped up a lot different,” she says. “They all were there supporting her, nurturing her through a time that was so, so tough. And because I’ve seen that growing up, for me, my girlfriends are so important. They’ve set the bar so high of all the emotional tick marks that a man needs to [check].”\nOne of those emotional tick marks—for Pednekar herself, as well as for Kanika as a character—is the ability for a man to listen (and accept) when a woman speaks openly about her desire. “Especially in my country, consent, loving yourself, the importance of sex, enjoying sex—it’s not something that is spoken of,” Pednekar says. “If you speak about the want to have sex, or if you discuss your sexual life openly—I mean, they look at you like, Oh my God, you’re a creature from a different part of the world. Because it scares people. Your freedom scares people. And that’s exactly what this film is about.” \nPednekar finds the cultural cognitive dissonance appalling: Not only is there stigma against women as sexual beings, but there’s an equally pervasive pressure for those women to find spouses—before time runs out!—with whom to have lots of sex. “Sadly, there’s so much pressure to just find that perfect man,” Pednekar says. “You do some of the silliest things. You hurt yourself. You hurt people around yourself; you lower your standards. Why the fuck should I lower my standards?” She continues, adding that settling down with a family becomes “like this holy gospel that you have to pray to. And then everything else is secondary, which means your life, your desires, your wants, your ambitions, what you want to do.”\nEven with a project as relatively tame as Thank You For Coming—at least when compared to contemporary rated-R comedies in Hollywood—Pednekar was prepared to deal with naysayers in her home country and abroad. She knew plenty of critics would ignore the film’s elaborate choreographed dance sequences, its pointed jokes about gender politics (“Femi-sanam, femi-sanam, whatever it is, that is what has brainwashed women!”), and its plainly rendered sincerity in favor of its supposed shock value. But when the trailer first dropped in September, Pednekar was surprised by the flood of positive comments from fans, “especially amongst the women, and amongst all my friends from the LGBTQIA-plus communities, and many, many boys,” she says. Then, adding an important caveat: “The ones that are evolved.”\nBut the ultimate impact of Thank You For Coming—especially as it approached its ritzy TIFF premiere—didn’t land with Pednekar until a member of her own staff approached her with some feedback upon the trailer’s debut. This woman, Pednekar says, is “from a small village,” where, “if a boy and a girl are holding hands, it’s a big deal. And she’s like, ‘Yeah, all my sisters and my mother saw it, and they really like your trailer.’” Pedenekar wasn’t sure she believed her. “I was like, ‘Are you sure? They didn’t feel uncomfortable?’” \nThe woman responded with a Hindi phrase that Pednekar translates, roughly, for me in English: “This is the reality of it, right?” In other words: Who cares if Thank You For Coming is uncomfortable? It’s also honest. \n“I was like, shit, we actually underestimate our audiences,” Pednekar says. “Woman to woman, you know what I mean. We might not be from the same social background. We might not be from the same class. We might not have the same education. We’re not from the same geographical location. But you know what I mean.”\nPhotography by Vaishnav Praveen/The House of Pixels, hair by Sanky Evrus, makeup by Sonik Sarwate, and styling by Manisha Melwani and Devanshi Tuli. \nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

{"title": "The Dyson Corrale Straightener Just Went on Sale Before Amazon Big Deal Days", "date": "2023-10-06 15:15:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDyson deals? Groundbreaking.\nIf you’re already planning which marked-down hair tool to invest in for Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days, their October Prime Day shopping event, there are so many options to choose from. Lucky for us, some secret sales have already begun, so you can currently shop from a huge selection of top-rated curling irons and blow dryers–not to mention on-sale skin care and a giant list of Amazon beauty deals. \nThe biggest win of all? Dyson quietly put their Corrale Hair Straightener on sale. Right now, you can buy it for 20 percent off, bringing the price down from $499 to $399. At this time, you can take advantage of this fantastic bargain–all with Amazon’s incredibly speedy shipping. Since all of Dyson’s tools are so coveted, there’s no telling how long you have before this straightener sells out–or worse–goes back to being full price.\nIn July’s Prime Day, the Corrale was not the only Dyson tool on sale on Amazon. Their Supersonic Hair Dryer, which recently went on sale on the Dyson site, was also $100 off on Amazon. Along with a slew of other marked down hair tools on Amazon, these viral tools are a fantastic investment to make this October Prime Day. Dyson’s hair tools have never been available–much less discounted–on the mass retailer until now. Here’s to hoping that as we get closer to October 10th and 11th, we see even more Dyson sales emerge.\nThe Corrale Straightener claims to inflict far less heat damage than standard flat irons, thanks to Dyson’s groundbreaking technology. The Corrale also has cordless capabilities, meaning you can use it on the move or traveling, without the need for a plug for up to thirty minutes. “I took my Corrale Straightener to Europe for ten days and forgot the charger. My bangs looked great the entire trip—didn’t even need to worry about a conversion plug and I love the versatile heat settings,” says Danielle James, ELLE’s Digital Beauty Director. While the newly launched Airstrait combines a blow dryer and a flat iron (watch the Dyson Airstrait in action on ELLE Editors), the Corrale can also add waves and curls to the hair.\nSo while you’re checking out the best Prime Big Deal Day beauty deals, make sure Dyson is on your radar. A markdown this extreme is very rare for Dyson, and there’s no telling when the straightener will be discounted again in the future–A.K.A., buy now, budget later.\nTatjana Freund is Hearst's Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor, covering beauty, fashion and more across multiple brands.

{"title": "How to Bleach Your Hair at Home: Featuring Expert Tips from Hair Colorists", "date": "2023-10-06 15:30:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nColorists break down the steps (and precautions) you need to take before you go blonde.  \nSo, you’ve decided to switch up your look and go full-fledged blonde, now what? For one, you could book a professional hair appointment— which honestly might be the most sensible solution. However, if you’re trying to save a few coins or if you simply don’t have time to spend all day in a salon chair, perhaps you've come to the conclusion that bleaching your hair at home is the only option left. \nAlthough you’re probably aware of this, we feel compelled to remind you that there are a few caveats that come along with DIY bleaching. Since bleach is a harsh chemical, you could run the risk of irritating your scalp or damaging your hair strands, so it’s essential to take all the necessary precautions to ensure that you’re prioritizing the health of your hair.\nTo make your at-home bleach journey a bit easier, we’ve consulted a few experts to help you achieve healthy-looking blonde strands. Ahead, you’ll notice a 12-step bleaching process, along with tips and tricks from hair colorist and R+ Co Collective member Richy Kandasamy and Wella Colorcharm and Clairol Professional Top Artist Oliver Adams. We’ve also made sure to feature a number of hair care products that you’ll need in the process, including bleaching kits, shampoos, and leave-in creams. \nLet's go blonde!\nHow does your hair feel? Can it truly handle the damage that you’re about to do to it? Kandasamy recommends beginning with a test. “Conduct an elasticity strand test,” he says. “Spray some water on a piece of hair, and let it absorb—stretch the wet hair very gently. If the wet hair stretches more than usual, or the texture turns a bit gummy, it is not safe to dye, if the hair goes back to its natural state, it’s in good condition to bleach.” He also recommends doing a patch test with a bleach mixture to see how your hair will react using the same method afterward with the small area of processed hair. \n Additionally, it’s important to understand your current hair color situation. If your hair is already processed, if you have used any type of box dye, or if you have virgin, unprocessed hair, these can cause variations in how your hair will lift with the bleach. \nYou’re going to need a few items in your tool kit before you begin. \nWhen beginning to prep your hair Kandasamy recommends sectioning your hair in four parts.  For added protection, rub coconut oil from the root to tip within sectioned hair to hydrate hair. “Using coconut oil before lightening hair can be very beneficial for the condition of the hair,” adds Kandasamy. “You want it to absorb into your hair for at least one hour, even longer if possible and then you can pre-light or bleach.” \nOnce all the necessary materials and prep have been done (and you’ve fully committed to going blonde) you’re ready to make the bleach mixture.\nFor each of the sections that you’ve divided, you’ll follow the below instructions. Kandasamy and Adams both suggest taking small portions within the sections of your hair and saturating the strands to make sure the hair is completely covered. \n“Apply the bleach with 30 volume to mid-length and ends about two inches away from the scalp,” says Kandasamy. “Then, right after, I’d apply the bleach with 20 volume on the roots.” This is the best method to use to avoid hot roots. Adams explains that hot roots are what happens when you apply bleach to the hair (from root to tip) at once and after processing the roots become a much lighter blonde shade compared to the yellow hair of the length. “The hair closest to the scalp processes color quicker than anywhere else on the hair shaft because the natural heat from the body acts as a heater when hair color is applied,” he explains. “This means that when you are doing a virgin application, [treating] hair that hasn't been color-treated, you must apply the color on the roots last, not first.”\nKandasamy also recommends making sure you use enough bleach mixture on your strands.  Once the mixture has been applied, just pop on a shower cap or plastic bag and set your timer.\nOkay, let’s talk hair levels and wait time. “Processing time depends on the manufacturer recommendation and also the natural level of starting point and end result desired,” says Kandasamy.  \nIt might be confusing, but like Kandasamy said, it’s important to understand what hair level (shade) you’re starting with and what color you want to achieve to figure out how long the bleach mixture should stay on your head. This chart from Wella shows exactly what a hair level is.\n“The level system for hair tells you how light or dark your color is going to be, one is the darkest and 10 is the lightest.” Adams explains.  “It’s important to understand that all blondes must be at least level seven or above, so if you are starting at a level one, you have to lift your hair six levels to even begin to see any type of blonde.”\nOnce you figure out your hair level and how light you want it, you can determine the wait time. If you want your hair to lift as light as possible, then leave the mixture on for 35-4o minutes (remember to never exceed 45 minutes). Adams recommends checking your hair to see if it’s lifted to the level you desire and says, “you wouldn’t want to lift hair from one to seven if you only need to lift it to four or five.”\nWhen it’s fully processed, it’s time to wash it out. Use lukewarm water, too hot or cold of water can shock your hair in its already fragile state. Make sure to completely rinse out the bleach and gently wash your hair to get out all the product.\nDon’t freak out! Your hair may look yellow or orange even and that’s okay, it just means you might have to bleach again. Make sure you assess and check the health of your hair using the stretch technique Kandasamy recommended in the first step. Using the hair level chart discussed in Step 6, determine your hair level to see if you need to bleach your hair again. If you do need to bleach again, follow steps three to seven again (your hair needs to be dry). \nMost importantly, make sure to give your hair enough recovery time and consider waiting a couple of days, weeks, or even months before attempting another bleach treatment. You might not achieve your desired results on the first try so it’s important to be patient. Adding excessive amounts of bleach to your hair can lead to something called over-processing, which is when your hair shaft becomes brittle and damaged. Over-processing can also cause breakage and hair loss which is the last thing you want to deal with, so make sure that you’re treating your hair with care.  \nRemember the color wheel from elementary school? This is where that comes into play. Toner will help neutralize any brassiness or yellow hues that will be lingering in your hair after bleaching. \nBefore you can tone, just make sure that your hair is light enough (remember the chart in Step 6). “It is important to understand that if the hair hasn’t been lifted light enough or to the proper level, putting a toner on it is not going to fix the problem and could possibly create a very unpleasant color,” Adams says. So always make sure you are using toner on the correct [hair] level.”\nToner can be applied to slightly damp hair and uses the same 2:1 mixing ratio and application method as the bleach.\nSimilar to the toner, a purple shampoo helps eliminate orange or yellow hues in your hair. Using a non-chemical toner (purple shampoo) is a great way to upkeep your blonde hair to keep it from getting brassy. Use a purple shampoo once or week or whenever your hair starts to get too yellow. \nMy personal favorite is the Matrix Total Results Brass Off, but there are tons of great purple shampoos to choose from.\nAfter all the chemical damage you just did to your hair, it’s important to replenish those strands. “My best advice is to always use a professional haircare product once or twice a week, [like] a hydrating hair mask,” says Kandasamy. Also, according to Adams you should avoid using heat on your hair:“You will want to minimize thermal heat like excessive blow-drying and ceramic heat styling in the 3-4 weeks after bleaching your hair.”\nAt this point you’re blonde! Since this is an at-home hair job, it might look different than what you thought, but embrace that you did it by yourself and rock it with pride!

{"title": "All About Bianca Censori, Kanye West’s Wife", "date": "2023-10-06 19:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nLess than one year after Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were declared legally single in March 2022, West has seemingly remarried, and his alleged new wife actually works for his company, Yeezy. \nTMZ reported on January 13 that West and Bianca Censori recently had a private wedding-like ceremony, although they haven’t yet filed a marriage certificate to make it legal. West was seen wearing a gold wedding band while at lunch with Censori in Beverly Hills on Monday, January 9, and the outlet reports he released a song about her, “Censori Overload” last month.\nWest has kept a lower profile since his disturbing antisemitic remarks and Hilter comments generated public outrage and lost him numerous business deals, including his lucrative Adidas Yeezy collection, and his billionaire status in October. Kardashian has not commented on West’s alleged new marriage, and Censori and West have only been sighted together very recently, per TMZ.\nHere, all you need to know about Censori and her connection to West.\nCensori is Australian. Her exact age isn’t public, but The Sun reports she’s believed to be around 28. Her LinkedIn describes her as having finished high school in 2012 and her undergraduate degree in 2017. Her position on the page is listed as head of architecture at Yeezy. She’s been a brunette in the past, but recently went blonde and short in new photos with West.\nCensori earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in architecture at the University of Melbourne. She finished her master’s education in 2020 and received her bachelor’s degree in 2017. She previously was a student architect at DP Toscano Architects from July 2017 to June 2020 prior to starting at Yeezy in November 2020, per her LinkedIn.\nCensori was asked how she got into architecture. “I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia,” she said. “As a child I was consistently drawn to creative endeavors, mostly artistic. I always wanted to be a sculptor and to me, architecture is the union of art and pragmatics. It is the grandest artistic gesture that we can place onto the earth. I was drawn to it, purely, as a shift in artistic scale.”\n“As a child, I spent a lot of time with my aunt who would consistently expose me to an array of art, film, and architecture,” she continued of what fueled her interest in the craft. “She really drove my love for design and instilled in me an eye for aesthetics that I was able to nurture into adulthood.”\nWest’s romance with Censori, at least publicly, is very new. It’s unclear when the two started dating. TMZ reported that Censori and West were seen at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills sharing a meal on Jan. 9, 2023. On January 13, when it reported on their alleged marriage, the outlet added that while West and Censori weren’t seen or photographed together side by side, she had been at “some Kanye-adjacent events, including a Balenciaga show in May.”\nMultiple sources connected to Censori and West told the outlet on January 13 that the couple “recently had a private ceremony to celebrate their love” but didn’t appear to file a marriage certificate yet to make it legal. West was seen wearing a gold ring to symbolize his commitment to her, TMZ reported.\nOn Friday, October 6, it was reported in documents obtained by the Daily Mail that the couple did get a “confidential” marriage license in California on December 20, 2022. Their wedding date was set one month after West's divorce was settled with ex-wife Kim Kardashian. \nThe license was never made public record before because of its “confidential” status, but the marriage took place in Palo Alto, and was officiated by James Mayfield. Censori's full name is on the license as well as West's legal name, which was changed to “Ye” in October 2021. Their marital home is listed as West’s Wyoming ranch. \nDaily Mail noted that what appeared to be Censori’s Instagram account (@bianca.censori) is now unavailable following news of her and West’s alleged marriage. Censori had 16,500 followers and just 27 posts before the handle was seemingly deactivated.\nYesterday evening, West’s ex-wife posted two quotes on her Instagram Story around the time news of the “marriage” came out. “Just remember, the black sheep turns into the goat. Keep doing you,” one read. Another that followed said, “People who want to see you win, will help you win. Remember that.” \nKardashian broke into tears when discussing how hard co-parenting with West had been in an interview released in late December, especially given his hateful public comments. West and Kardashian share four children: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm.\n“One day my kids will thank me...for not bashing their dad,” she said at one point. She added later, “I definitely protected him, and I still will in the eyes of my kids. For my kids. So, in my home, my kids don’t know anything that goes on [in] the outside world.”\nA source told Page Six a few days after news of the marriage broke that Kardashian “hates” Censori, and has obviously been aware of her for some time.\n“Kim hates her,” said the insider. “She’s pretty. And Kim hates pretty girls.”\nTMZ pointed out that West released a song with Censori’s name in the track title last month. Its beginning verse, “And The Bible said / I can’t have anymore sex / Till marriage,” may be a hint, the outlet speculated, about West’s sudden decision to get remarried.\nAngelina Censori, Bianca's sister, recently told the Herald Sun, according to the Daily Mail, “It’s very exciting news for both my sister and the family, but we choose to have some privacy for the time being.”\nAlyssia Censori, another relative of Bianca, said that she was “super happy for them both.”\nOn January 22, a new report from The Herald Sun stated that Kanye may be heading to Melbourne to officially meet everyone. A source said that the pair, “will spend time in Ivanhoe, east of the CBD, where Censori grew up.”]\nKardashian wasn't against Censori and West's union, as long as she is positive force to West. The source said, “Bianca has been around their kids. Kim, ultimately, just wants Kanye to be at peace. So if Bianca helps with that, then it’s fine.”\nFans spotted the couple in Tokyo in late June. At one point, West took photos with a fan while Censori was photographed in their vehicle, holding a Hello Kitty doll.\nOn June 11, Censori made headlines for being photographed holding hands with West's oldest child North at his birthday party.\nIn early August, West and Censori were traveling around Italy, and walking barefoot through the ancient cities of Florence and Rome. They even went sans footwear to a Travi Scott concert and while visiting a fabric factory in the Prato East district.\nJason Lee, who formerly worked as West’s head of media and partnerships, told Page Six that he thinks the barefoot look is a PR stunt.\n“I think the fact that people are talking about Kanye’s feet shows just how much power he still has in the wake of cancel culture,” he said. “I think it’s a smart and strategic move. I wouldn’t be surprised if the next time we saw shoes on his feet it would be a project that he designed.”\nCensori drew some outrage from locals for dressing very provocatively, wearing near naked, sheer bodysuits in Italy where her nipples were visible. But after West himself had a wardrobe malfunction where his butt was exposed on a boat, sources spoke to TMZ about how Kardashian felt about their vacation coverage. She isn’t concerned. Kardashian “isn’t staying up to date” on West and his personal life, the sources claimed, noting she is only focused on co-parenting affairs. The sources added that Kardashian viewed West’s NSFW photos vas just an “unfortunate” wardrobe malfunction that paparazzi caught.\nA source additionally spoke to Page Six on September 1 about a false tabloid report that Kardashian wanted to warn Censori about West.\n“She absolutely does not want to talk to her [Censori],” the source said. “Kim is actually a firm believer in letting people be on their own journey and figure out life. She would never call someone and warn them.”\nVenetian Turismo Motoscafi, the company who rented the boat where West's derriere was exposed said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia on Sunday September 3 that the couple is “no longer be welcome” on their ships.\nThey stated that their employees were “completely unaware” of what was happening at the time, blaming a “third person on board the taxi” who “obstructed the captain’s view”\n“The driver had to keep a lookout for traffic and did not see these obscenities,” the company said. “If this had happened, he would have immediately disembarked and reported the transgressors to those in authority.”\nThey added, “We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behavior. Mr. West and his wife will certainly no longer be welcome on board our company’s boats.” \nIn early September, shortly after their trip to Italy, a source told US Weekly that Censori's friends have grown concerned about how her marriage has swept her away from them.\n“Bianca’s friends are becoming concerned because their friendship with her hasn’t been the same in quite some time,” the source said. “Bianca has always been a strong, independent woman who has her own voice, but they haven’t seen that lately because they don’t speak or see each other as often as they had before she started seeing Kanye.”\nThey added that is Censori is “happy, then they’re happy for her” but they find it “hard to tell... because she’s been isolated from them.”\nThe couple continued their European odyssey in September, heading to Berlin, Germany, where they were photographed waiting in line for a meal at the popular eatery, Mustafa’s Gemüse Kebap. In the photos, Censori is wearing her signature see-through, strapless nude bodysuit over a pair of high-waisted underwear. She was also carrying a backpack and walking in clear heels with pointed toes.\nWest wore black from head-to-toe, with his face shrouded by his extendable collar. They each got a kebab, stopping to eat on a nearby bench.\nCensori's outfits, particularly her see-through body stockings, have drawn a lot of attention as the couple cavorts through Europe. Sources talking to Page Six says that the looks are put together by Laura Beham of the Zurich-based design collective Proto-types per West and his team's instructions.\nThey stated that the rapper has a “whole atelier in Italy.” \n“Anything he wants to make they can make it. He’s really just making it on the spot,” said Mowalola Ogunlesi, the London-based designer who worked with West on his Yeezy Gap collab. “They just buy tights and style it and cut it on [Censori] … Usually they get Wolford. Tights are not safe when they’re around.”\nAn anonymous source confirmed Ogunlesi's statements, saying, “They design it and have an in-house team that creates everything in a day.”  \nSources painted a disturbing picture of West and Censori’s relationship and West’s power over Censori to Daily Mail in early October. One source said, “Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speak and wear what he wants her to wear. She is also required to eat certain food items and to work out even though Kanye doesn’t work out. She has no mind of her own anymore and obeys him because he has convinced her that they are royal.”\nA second source claimed that her friends have been trying and failing to stage an intervention. “[She] is stuck and her friends are trying to save her, but no one can because of the blockades Kayne has put up [around her],” the source said. “Everyone is extremely concerned. This isn’t who she is. She is an incredibly outspoken and lively person who is never one to keep her mouth shut.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "ELLE Escapes: Dubrovnik", "date": "2023-10-06 19:37:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDespite a flood of tourists in recent years, Croatian hot spot Dubrovnik is absolutely worth spending your flight miles on. Often called “the Pearl of the Adriatic,” this coastal southern European city has so much to offer—from its imposing, sea-kissed fortress walls and palatial architecture  seen on Game of Thrones to its rich history and award-winning food and wine. In fact, this medieval, cliffside marvel has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site for over four decades, and was beautifully restored in the aftermath of the Croatian War of Independence in the ’90s.\nLike the rest of the country, Dubrovnik is a melting pot of Italian and Balkan cultural influences—yet it still has its own unique identity. I began my 11-day Croatian tour there, followed by a visit to the small island of Korčula and major port city Split. And while I was only in Dubrovnik for two days—a reasonable amount of time to see the city’s main sites—I could have easily stayed there longer, since it was undoubtedly my favorite spot that I visited on my trip. Ahead, your full scoop on what to see, eat, drink and where to stay.\nStradun, or the main street in Dubrovnik, is where you’ll find many key historic monuments, including St. Blaise’s Catholic Church, dedicated to the patron saint of Dubrovnik; Church of St. Ignatius, which houses the city’s oldest bell erected in 1355; and two monasteries also dating back to the 14th century. But, in my opinion, no tour of the Old Town would be complete without a visit to Rector’s Palace. Located in the heart of the city in Luza Square, this Gothic-Renaissance structure was built in the 15th century as the official residence of the city’s rectors—who each served as the leader of the Republic of Dubrovnik for one-month terms. Today, the site houses the city’s Cultural Museum, which features over 10,000 artifacts ranging from furniture to fashion, artwork, coins, and armory from the 14th to 20th centuries. Spend an afternoon browsing the impressive collections and wandering the historic halls, and make sure to stop by the palace’s picturesque courtyard for some seriously stunning photo ops. (FYI, Games of Thrones fans may recognize this museum as the Spice King’s Palace.) While entry to this particular site isn’t free, you can purchase a single ticket for 15 euros or buy a Dubrovnik Pass, which includes access to this museum and a handful of others in area starting at 35 euros for the day.\nAs iconic as it may be, walking the Old Town walls is one of the busiest and most expensive attractions in Dubrovnik. Instead, you can hike up to Mount Srđ for free to enjoy an even more spectacular outlook without all the long lines. (You can also reach the peak by cable car, but a round-trip ride will set you back 27 euros). The head of the trail, called Staza Prema Utvrdi Imperial, is about a 20-minute walk from the main entrance of the Old Town, and once you get started, the hike is moderately challenging. You’ll definitely work up a sweat while climbing the cobblestone switchbacks, but the breathtaking panoramic views at the top make the trek absolutely worth it. Plus, the peak even has a few attractions, including a large fortress, a massive stone cross, the Homeland War Museum, and a dreamy restaurant. Word to the wise: Leave at least three hours for the journey so you can make it all the way to the top, spend some time there, and leisurely walk back down to the City Gates.\nIf you’re looking to escape the crowds of the Old Town, I highly recommend visiting the Elaphitis for a day. This cluster of 14 islands is situated just northwest of Dubrovnik, with the three largest islets—Koločep, Lopud, and Šipan—currently being the only permanently inhabited. I signed up for a snorkel tour embarking from the Old Town harbor for about 60 euros, which began by stopping at Croatia’s famous blue and green sea caves off the remote islands of Biševo and Ravnik. During certain times of day, sunlight will creep through the cave walls and bounce off the white seabeds, giving the water an enchanting, iridescent effect. Finally, we enjoyed a few hours at Lopud’s beautiful Sunj Beach, one of the most beloved and only sandy beaches on the Elaphiti Islands. While I chose to relax shoreside and splash in the shallow waters during my time there, you can also hike up to the town to explore an old ruined fortress and Franciscan monastery. Alternatively, sommeliers and foodies may prefer to venture to Šipan, known for its verdant vineyards and olive groves. Or, if you’re seeking the ultimate tranquil getaway, consider heading to Koločep, the smallest, lushest, and most serene of the three islands.\nPair with Mason Bottom.\nHotel restaurants can get a bad rap for having lackluster menus and sub-par atmospheres, but Restaurant Pjerin—located inside the gorgeous Villa Dubrovnik hotel—is certainly an exception. This Michelin-recommended eatery offers exquisite Mediterranean dishes and is the epitome of “quiet luxury,” featuring soft, minimalist, neutral décor set against absolutely mesmerizing views of the turquoise-tinged Adriatic. I went for a stunning sunset dinner on the restaurant’s spacious terrace and ordered the delicately rolled lobster pasta and chocolate cake with pistachio gelato for dessert. To start, patrons were also treated to a complimentary selection of seasonal breads and  hors d’oeuvres—which included a mouth-watering sea bass tartare, crispy fish balls, and a refreshing green gazpacho made with avocado and black pepper. Each dish was presented so artfully that when my waiter brought out the restaurant’s (also complimentary) tasting of chocolate truffles at the end of my meal, I did, indeed, nearly shed a tear.  \nDubrovnik admittedly isn’t an inexpensive European city to visit, so for anyone seeking quality dining options on a budget, I recommend Wanda. Spearheaded by former Los Angeles restauranteur and Dubrovnik-native Goran Starčić, this quaint joint on Prijeko street serves up an array of simple, affordable, and tasty Mediterranean classics—think icons like squid ink risotto and spaghetti alle vongole, all made with locally-sourced ingredients. (I had the latter and can confirm it was delicious). You can also expect fast service and a relaxing ambiance, complete with a lovely outdoor seating area protected from all the hustle and bustle.\nAsk any local for Dubrovnik restaurant recommendations, and they’ll likely point you to 360. The Michelin-starred restaurant is popular for its five-course tasting menus and gourmet à la carte options delivering fresh spins on traditional Mediterranean and Croatian dishes. With its swanky dining room flanking the harbor, meticulously plated menu, and thoughtful wine pairings, 360 should certainly be on your itinerary. Just note the restaurant is only open for dinner, and it’s wise to make a reservation, as this place books up quickly.\nTourists flock to this bar built into the cliffs not only to enjoy a refreshing libation, but also namely to watch brave souls jump into the sea below. Head downstairs to the base of the establishment to take in all the action, or if you’re feeling adventurous, join the lineup. You can jump off the cliff from different points, anywhere from about 15 feet to 60 feet above, depending on your comfort level. Keep in mind the bar is cash only and doesn’t serve cocktails, only bottled beer. Oh, and it’s probably not the best idea to drink and jump!\nAnother dazzling watering hole, Cave Bar More is located on the Lapad peninsula just two miles away from the bustling Old Town. It’s set within a natural cave beneath the Hotel More, extending three levels and opening up to an idyllic outdoor patio on the cliffs. (This bar can also be rented for private events like wedding parties and proposals, so you can expect the vibes to be top-notch). Naturally, the cocktails are Insta-worthy as well.\nAlthough Croatia is quickly becoming a force in the wine world (Croatian wines earned over a dozen metals at the 2022 Decanter World Awards, the most prestigious wine competition in the global industry), few Croatian wines are exported. To sample some of the country’s finest while you’re visiting, head to D’vino Wine Bar Dubrovnik. This homey haunt has over 60 wine varietals, including a number from local small wine producers and family vineyards across Croatia’s renowned wine regions like Slavonia, Istria, and Pelješac. Choose from a vast selection of deep reds to dry whites, and consider pairing your vino with one of the bar’s gourmet meat and cheese platters. For a more hands-on experience, D’vino also hosts educational wine tastings Wednesdays through Sundays starting at 210 kn per person (or about $30 a pop).\n\nNestled on a quiet street just a few steps away from the Pile Gate, the St. Joseph’s boutique hotel is about as charming as it gets. The 16th-century building contains just six rooms, which have all been elegantly renovated while still retaining some of the original stonework. I began my stay in the cozy attic room and moved to the Deluxe King Suite during my second night. Aside from the Deluxe Apartment (an adjacent cottage that was once a family home in the 13th century), this is the largest space you can stay in—complete with a sizable lounging area, a dining table, kitchenette, and luxe marbled bathroom with his and her sinks. And if the sophisticated digs weren’t enough, the delightful staff treats you like absolute royalty. Every morning, guests can take advantage of a complimentary breakfast of local sweets, savory dishes, and a signature green smoothie prepared by the in-house chef. And when you stay in the King Suite, you can get the spread delivered to your room (you can best believe I rolled out of bed in the hotel’s plush bathrobe and slippers to grab mine). The concierge also provides superb 24-hour service and will kindly walk you and your luggage to and from the hotel and city entrance, since no cars are allowed to drive within the Old Town. \nMy visit to Restaurant Pjerin left me enraptured by Villa Dubrovnik itself. A scenic 15-minute stroll from the Old Town, this secluded property is a dreamy, airy oasis. There are a total of 56 guest rooms, all of which feature private sea view terraces and some of which even boast their own plunge pools and jacuzzis. Other on-site amenities include an outdoor deck for tanning, an indoor swimming pool, gym, sauna, and even a sun-drenched library for when you just want to curl up with a good book. My takeaway: You could truly relax here all day and not feel guilty about it. \nPart of the Adriatic Luxury Hotels network, Hotel Excelsior is one of the swankiest hotels in Dubrovnik—with a five-star rating and past celebrity guests like Queen Elizabeth II and Elizabeth Taylor to prove it. The 158-room property is set in a former royal villa, now outfitted with modern, custom-made furnishings and a variety of opulent amenities. There’s a fitness center, two restaurants, a spa with Turkish baths and an indoor swimming pool, a private sunbathing area, and more. The entire property is just a five-minute walk from the fortress walls, but if the idea of luxuriating in your bathtub while taking in the Old Town sights tickles your fancy, the Excelsior Signature Suite will be right up your alley. \nKeep your skin protected and looking its best with this dermatologist-crafted sunscreen, featuring added antioxidants and plumping peptides. \nAfter a dip in the Adriatic, I have to make sure my full brows don’t look crazy. A quite swipe of this clear, flexible wax, and you’re good to go. \nFor a streak-free mug come rain, sweat, or shine, don’t forget to pack Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray. You can also spritz a layer of this underneath your foundation for an extra dose of hydration.\nSam Peters is a Senior Commerce Editor at Hearst covering fashion, beauty and lifestyle.

{"title": "The Bizarre Americana Style of <i>Love Is Blind</i>’s JP", "date": "2023-10-06 21:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nHe’s a walking red (white and blue) flag.\nOf the three couples who made it out of the pods in season 5 of Love Is Blind, only two of them survived the fateful Mexico trip, where the new fiancés are meant to get to know each other physically after weeks of only talking from behind a wall. The couple that didn’t survive—Jared Pierce (JP), a firefighter, and Taylor Rue, a teacher—burned out in such spectacular fashion that it makes you wonder what they even saw in each other in the first place. After an awkward reveal, during which JP looked like he had never interacted with a human woman in his entire life, things only became progressively more uncomfortable, until finally he admitted that he was finding it difficult to communicate with Taylor because he didn’t like the makeup she wore at the reveal. (Huh?)\nYet throughout each increasingly excruciating scene—from their first pod meeting in episode 1 to their final goodbye in episode 6—JP reveals a personal style quirk far more sinister than heavy makeup: the man is obsessed with American flags. This includes but is not limited to: American flag socks, T-shirts, button-downs, basketball jerseys, bathing suits, sneakers, and—our personal favorite—an American flag handkerchief that he snots all over and then proceeds to politely fold and gingerly place atop the couch pillow, as if he didn’t just blow his nose into it. \nJP’s obsession with the American flag isn’t just an affectation played up for the show. According to his Instagram, his love of America is not just a style choice, it’s a lifestyle. Here he is at the beach with red and white stripes down his back, wearing American flag swim trunks and an America baseball hat. Here he is posing his dog next to a red, white, and blue fire hydrant. Here he is going skiing for the first time in a star-spangled snowsuit. His friends even threw him a “surprise America party” for his 30th birthday. \nLove Is Blind fans across the internet appear to be equally baffled by JP’s style choices, particularly those who aren’t American. “JP seems to wear a lot of flags. He’s either wearing a shirt with stars, stripes, both or it’s red, white and/or blue. It’s in every episode which is odd,” wrote one Redditor. “Granted, I’m not from the U.S., so this could be just a standard styling choice that a lot of people employ to show their patriotism. Is this abnormal? Do people carry flags? What’s going on here? Would love some context from someone local.”\nBut even Americans are confused. “This is weird af, right? I’m an East Coast black male and we don’t really do the star-spangled thing,” another Redditor wrote. “That said, what kind of nutcase owns that much flag stuff? Before anyone says it, I am well aware of the MAGA crazies. I just assume they have other kinds of clothing to cycle through…”\nAmerican flag clothing has a complicated history; for some, donning stars and stripes is the ultimate symbol of pride for one’s country. For others, turning the flag into something to wear can feel disrespectful. Since the middle of the 20th century, the American flag has been worn as both a sign of protest and a sign of national support. In the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, the flag served as an emotional symbol, meant to unify a grieving nation. But after the 2016 election, the American flag has become seemingly inextricable from Donald Trump and his flock of MAGA followers. As The New Yorker put it, “To some, the American flag represents freedom, but the nation’s most enduring symbol is taken on partisan significance.” This partisan affiliation with the flag hasn’t been lost on internet commenters: “Someone needs to find out where [JP] was Jan 6th,” quipped one Redditor. \nWhatever JP intended to communicate with his stars and stripes getups, he’s stayed largely under the radar since his breakup with Taylor aired last week. Taylor, meanwhile, has spoken out about how much his comments about her makeup upset her. “It was hurtful,” she told USA Today. “I was also really confused, because I don't know how you can completely change because of the way someone looks.” This season, it seems the show has finally answered the question its title poses: Love is not, in fact, blind. But it is patriotic.\nJessica Roy is the former Digital Director of ELLE.com. Prior to that, she worked as the News Editor of The Cut.

{"title": "<i>Fair Play</i> Was Always Going to End Like This", "date": "2023-10-06 21:00:00", "text": "“For me, more than being a film about female empowerment, this is really a film about male fragility,” director Chloe Domont tells ELLE.com.\nThis story contains discussions of sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs support, contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673) or visit rainn.org.\nSpoilers below. \nFair Play’s first and final scenes couldn’t feel more different. The former shows two lovers in a state of careless bliss, hooking up and simultaneously getting engaged in the bathroom at someone else’s wedding; the latter has them unraveling in a fierce confrontation, one wielding a blade at the other. But in a way, the film ends the same way it begins: in blood. \nIn the opener, Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) is on her period while her fiancé Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) performs oral sex on her. In the closer, Luke is the one who bleeds as Emily scolds him and slashes his arm with a kitchen knife. Their tense confrontation concludes with her killer last line: “Now wipe the blood off my floor, and get out. I’m done with you now.” \n“It was always going to build to that moment, and it was always going to end there,” writer and director Chloe Domont tells ELLE.com. So, how exactly did we get there?\nLet’s go back to the beginning: Domont wanted her lead couple to get engaged at the start of the film so viewers could see them happy and in love before things went downhill. She wondered, “What’s the most ridiculous way that a couple could get engaged?” Then she realized: “Oh, if they’re covered in blood, basically.” The result is a messy, dysfunctional, yet charmingly awkward sex scene, but the stains on Luke’s face and Emily’s dress are an omen: “What the blood represents is the violence to come, which is telling the audience, ‘Don’t get too comfortable.’”\nThroughout the course of the film, Emily and Luke’s seemingly perfect romance crumbles when she gets promoted over him at their cutthroat hedge fund where, by the way, no one knows they’re dating. Luke is reluctantly congratulatory at first; he wants to be a caring, supportive partner, but his resentment grows as Emily buddies up with the guys at the office and makes big wins for the firm (further proving that she deserved the job and he didn’t), all while still dressing like “a cupcake” at work. \nLuke’s snide remarks turn into slut-shaming and eventually into a full spiral that involves him showing up to work erratic and disheveled, sabotaging Emily’s career during a high-stakes meeting. Grasping any semblance of power or so-called manhood, Luke tries to keep the upper hand on Emily by using physical force: Later that night, he sexually assaults her at their engagement party in a scene that starts consensually but then becomes aggressive as she tries to resist. “That’s the only way for Luke to reclaim the power from Emily in that moment, because he’s physically stronger than her,” Domont says.\nThis is the last straw for Emily. When she confronts Luke at their apartment at the end of the film, she’s feeling a lot of things—pain, anger, and still, love—but decides to hold him accountable for his abuse. She finds him ready to move out and fly to San Francisco the next morning—to start his own firm. Apologizing isn’t on his list of priorities. \n“Unfortunately, the only way to hold Luke accountable in that moment is to use the same physical force that he used against her,” says Domont. So, Emily grabs a knife, and makes him apologize for hurting her—professionally, emotionally, and physically. “You sit here, suddenly acting normal after terrorizing me, after cutting me down day after day, and you think that I’m just gonna let you walk out that door and act like nothing happened?” she says in disbelief. \nShe slices Luke’s arm and brings him to his knees, making him say “I’m nothing.” Here is when Luke finally acknowledges everything he’s done, weeping and begging for Emily’s forgiveness (“I will do anything to make it okay for you,”). But she just orders him to clean up his bloody mess and leave. In the final shot, focused on Dynevor’s face, her knife is heard clattering to the floor off-screen. The credits roll.\n“For me, the ending is really about Emily reclaiming the power that Luke takes away from her when he sexually assaults her,” Domont says. \nShe explains, “Ultimately, I never saw this as an ending of female revenge. While there are definitely elements of female rage from the abuse that he’s put her through, for me, the whole movie really builds up to the moment where he mutters the words, ‘I’m nothing.’ That’s the moment where he finally faces his own inferiority, when he finally faces his own weakness, and his own failures. His inability to face all those things causes so much harm, and so much destruction for both of them over the course of this film. When he finally does embrace that, you see him just release everything in his body, everything that he’s been holding his whole life is just released in this moment of finally just accepting this thing that he’s been running from. For me, more than being a film about female empowerment, this is really a film about male fragility.”\nDomont set out “to make a thriller about power dynamics on the ugliest level,” and she did.\nAs for the “wipe the blood off my floor” closing line, she wanted to give the audience “one final surprise.” And it’s true: Before she utters those words, it’s unclear what Emily will do or say to Luke, thanks to Dynevor’s layered performance. She’s not entirely consumed with rage and it seems possible she’ll lean in to kiss him. \n“We’ve seen her go back to him before, and so I wanted to just tee up the audience to believe, ‘Oh my God, is she going to go back together with him again? Is this going to be a moment where they just both submit to a life of pain and dysfunction?’ As you’re sitting with that, then she undercuts him with the [line], which is, ‘No, I’m actually done with this, and I’m done with you.’ It’s almost like she holds him for the last time, and once she does that for the last time, it’s a light switch. She’s now past it, and she’s out, and that’s it.”\nEven the blocking, with Luke kneeling and Emily hovering above then bending down to him, is telling. “This is a man who refuses to accept this submissive role…but as soon as she forces him into submission, that’s when he’s able to release it all.”\nIt would be too easy to write Luke off as solely pathetic, even if that last scene really makes him seem so, but Domont empathized with the character. Luke makes a compelling antagonist because his toxicity isn’t obvious at first; his misogyny is subtle before it grows more blatant. He’s charming and loves Emily and knows he’s supposed to root for her, but struggles when his own power is tested. He’s the kind of liberal millennial man who was raised on traditional gender roles but learned to shed them as he grew up. But still, when he feels threatened, he reverts to suppressing Emily.\n“The more I leaned into Luke’s pain, I think I just realized that was the more interesting version of the film,” Domont says. “The more that Alden tapped into that pain onscreen, and the more that we saw him struggle with those two things—wanting to support her, but also wanting to get there first—the more that we saw him internalize the duality of those opposing forces, I thought that it’s the more human version of the film, and it’s the more exciting version of the film, because it’s not black and white.”\nEven the fact that Luke goes down on Emily while she’s on her period is supposed to signal to us that he is a progressive guy. “I wanted to show early on that we as the audience are made to believe that this is a man who’s not threatened by a woman, because he’s literally got her blood on his face. How could he be threatened by a woman if he has her blood on his face?” Domont laughs. \nThat period sex scene is also notable for breaking film taboos. Domont wrote it because “it’s not something I had seen before.” She pointedly adds, “I also liked it because I knew that a man would never write this scene, so that was exciting to me, too. I am here to flip the script, and so that just felt like part of that.”\nDynevor agrees. “When you see a film like this, it really pushes you to want to create more and put more female influence out into the world. We as women know these things happen all the time, but why are we not seeing it on our screens?” she told ELLE in our October cover story.  \nWith themes like menstruation, sexism in the workplace, apologizing for one’s success, and the emotional labor of tending to the male ego, Domont expected Fair Play to resonate with women. But it has resonated with men too.    \nAt one screening, she saw “a group of men [aged] 60-plus just huddled in a circle, just talking about their marriages, and talking about their divorces, and talking about the way they were raised. It felt like this film unlocked something that they felt afraid to talk about.” At another screening, a man in his early 80s approached her “just so triggered by the film on so many different levels, and opening up to me about his personal experiences, and some of these dynamics. It’s incredibly gratifying.” \nDomont senses that writing a nuanced story and morally gray characters might have something to do with those reactions. “I think that people really appreciate that they’re not being told, or it’s not on the nose—a lesson about feminism, or a lesson about the way men should be. It’s not telling you anything, it’s just allowing you to experience something, and at the same time, enjoy it. Ultimately, I made a film that I wanted to be entertaining.”  \nThe director herself has enjoyed films done in a similar tone from European filmmakers like Ruben Östlund, Andrea Arnold, and the Dardenne Brothers. While Fair Play is just her feature debut (she’s previously directed episodes of Billions and Ballers), she aims to create more narratives like these in the future. “I want to continue to explore provocative shades of gray. I want to continue to tell stories that provoke, that ask tough questions, but I also want to continue to take audiences on a ride. I think there was nothing more gratifying than feeling like I had the audience on the edge of their seat for two hours.” She laughs, then continues, “I think there’s nothing more exciting than feeling like I have them by the throat.”\nDumont doesn’t just mean during the movie, but after, too. She’s very eager to see what debates Fair Play ignites, and “what relationships we can break up.” She calls it “the date movie from hell,” as a joke—but also not. “Probably not the first date, but if you’re starting to date someone, go see this movie, then have a conversation after....That can reveal a lot about a person.”\nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

{"title": "Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper Were Photographed Getting Dinner Together", "date": "2023-10-06 21:09:00", "text": "Gigi Hadid’s one-year “situationship” with Leonardo DiCaprio has come to an end, but the model may have another relationship with an A-lister brewing. The Daily Mail ran photos of Hadid, 28, leaving dinner with Bradley Cooper, 48, at New York City’s Via Carota yesterday, which you can see here.\nThe two stars left in the same car after their meal. Hadid wore a low-rise miniskirt with a white crop top and leather jacket. Cooper, meanwhile, was seen in an open flannel shirt, blue T-shirt, and jeans. It is unclear whether they were on a date or just having a friendly dinner. Both are single at the moment.\nHadid was also romantically linked to 27-year-old music producer Cole Bennett last month. \nUs Weekly confirmed that Hadid and DiCaprio’s romantic relationship had ended in mid-September. While DiCaprio “really saw himself dating” Hadid, the feeling wasn’t mutual.\nA source explained that lifestyle differences were a factor in their split, and that it was more Hadid’s choice to end their fling than DiCaprio’s. \nThe two stars “both travel a lot by nature of their jobs,” the source said. “But Gigi is taking more work that allows her to spend more time with her child [3-year-old Khai]. And Leo still travels a lot and likes to go out a lot. And there’s temptation and all those factors had been concerns of hers.” \n“She doesn’t want her boyfriend to be in and out going to clubs and events and working all the time,” the source continued. “She wants someone to be hands-on and a partner. [She] doesn’t want to date someone seriously unless she can introduce them to her child.” She and DiCaprio remain friends, the source said.\nAs for Cooper, he last made headlines for his relationship with Irina Shayk, his ex and mother of his daughter Lea de Seine. For a moment there was a rumored possibility of them rekindling their romance. \nBut a Page Six source dismissed the theory Cooper was bothered by Shayk dating Tom Brady in mid-September. “[Shayk and Cooper] haven’t been together in so long,” the source said. “They are co-parents and that’s that. They are best friends. They are happy. Brad really likes Tom, and there is nothing but support.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "The 8 Best Nail Trends From the Spring 2024 Runways", "date": "2023-10-06 21:35:00", "text": "Open this before your next nail appointment.  \nFeeling down? Need to juuz up your look a bit? Desiring a little self-care? You can never go wrong with a relaxing manicure. Personally, my eyes are always on the lookout for the latest nail trends as to prevent future me from wasting 20 minutes in the nail salon, perusing through Instagram for my next design (sorry to my nail artist). Whether you want some nail art inspiration or to simply know the latest nail color trends, the fashion week runways are like the crystal ball of trends.  And this season was no exception! On the  Spring/Summer ’24 runway, nail art focused on the feminine, drawing inspiration from the viral balletcore trend seen all over the runways. Classic styles, like the french manicure, got a modern update with chrome detailing and silver chrome nails, which are currently trending for Fall/Winter ’23 (you can thank Beyoncé and the Renaissance Tour), will continue to trend into the new year. Logomania was heavily trending in the pandemic era and now has popped up on nails and in a world full of stiletto and coffin lengths, this season, short nails reigned supreme. \nI caught up with Natalie Minerva, celebrity nail artist and OPI Global Ambassador, to talk all the Spring/Summer ’24 trends we loved on the fashion week runways. You don’t have to wait for the new year to discover the new trends (or even ask your Magic 8 ball). Keep reading to discover all the new trends, first! \n\n\nHelmut Lang played scrabble with nail art for Peter Do’s runway debut as the new Creative Director. A simple clear manicure spelled out H-E-L-M-U-T L-A-N-G in black font, a refreshing take from the logomania of past seasons. We have all the details, here.\nIf Scrabble isn’t quite your thing, go for the logo to spell out the love for your favorite brand. Celebrity nail artist Julie Kandalec hand painted the Kate Spade dot noel monogram on nails and gave the logomania trend an update by finishing it off with a black, skinny french design. \nSkinny jeans may be out, but skinny french manicures are in. A thin line turns this barely there manicure into Parisian chic.  \nRemember when colorful french manicures were the summer must-have nails? It applies to the skinny french trend, too! This red, skinny french manicure goes perfectly with a classic red lip. \nChrome nails are currently trending (thanks, Beyoncé) and do not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. “This trend will definitely dip into Spring/Summer—it’s applicable yar-round in my opinion,” says Minerva. \n“3D lined chrome French nails, like the ones we saw at Parabal Gurung, will be a big trend for Spring/Summer ’24,” shares Minerva. “We love a futuristic French,” she exclaims.\nBalletcore beauty gets an update at Mirror Palais with this pink, pearly chrome version. “Pink pearl is always a refreshing look that combines a nostalgic touch on a new modern classic,” says Minerva.\nIf pink is not your thing, you can still get into the balletcore trend by leaning into a pearly white or vanilla chrome look. \nNo manicure, no cry. At Michael Kors, Jin Soon Choi focused more on nail health, and gave models barely there manicures with light pink polish. \nProenza Schouler had models walk down the runway with short, clean, manicured nails. Mani minimalism at its finest!  \nNegative space will have a positive impact on manicure trends for Spring/Summer ’24 and is a fun way to have a minimalist manicure, but still play up design. “Simple lines and dots in black kept this manicure so simple and yet so impactful,” says Minerva.\n“For Spring Summer ’24, expect to see lots of shimmers that evoke a dreamy feeling like frosted chromes, baby pink shimmers, and sheer milky lavenders,” says Minerva. \nSaweetie once sang, “Ten white toes, I'm always tip top;” however, at Alice + Olivia, that monochromatic minimalist energy was invested in the nails. \nWhite nails were spotted on models at Libertine and is the perfect option for your clean girl aesthetic.  \nI will keep it short and sweet—go short and red for Spring 2024. Red nails are a classic and often showcased on long nails, but Proenza Schouler reminds us how great the color looks on short, manicured nails.\nClassic red nails always look sexy, no matter the nail length, as proven backstage at Brandon Maxwell. \nDanielle James is the Digital Beauty Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "15 Hyaluronic Acid Serums for Radiant Skin Year-Round", "date": "2023-10-06 21:40:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n Plump up the volume. \nEach skin care collection houses a bevy of serums that take on a heavy responsibility. Serums packed with salicylic or glycolic acid are asked to address pesty breakouts; vitamin C helps to brighten the dark spots left behind from said breakouts, and niacinamide and peptides smooth skin, among many other benefits. However, if there’s face serum your beauty arsenal should keep in stock, it’s hyaluronic acid.\nNo need to second guess what the purpose of a hyaluronic acid serum is—a close look at the name will tell you all you need to know about the popular ingredient: retaining moisture is its primary goal. “Serums are low viscosity, thinner liquids that are typically formulated to be used under a moisturizer. Hyaluronic acid is a humectant,” Dr. Camille Howard, NY-based dermatologist and founder of Girl+Hair, tells ELLE.com. \n\nLike a tall glass of water on a hot day, hyaluronic acid allows your skin to soak up all that hydration so you can look fresh and plump throughout the day. Choosing the right serum for your skin type doesn’t need to be complicated. We consulted Dr. Camille Howard, and several customer reviews to find the 15 best simple-yet-effective hyaluronic acid serums to incorporate into your routine.\nNeostrata’s iteration of a hyaluronic acid serum exfoliates and soothes. Dr. Howard recommends this serum because it “combines three types of hyaluronic acid and also harnesses the power of lactic acid. In one treatment serum, you can enjoy the benefits of alpha hydroxy acids and humectants,” she explains.\nSize: 1.7 fl oz\nNeostrata star rating: 4.5/5 stars \nA Neostrata reviewer said: “This was a great product! I liked that there wasn’t really a scent to it. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day. I also feel like my skin was brighter and smoother after using this.”\nSeveral factors can contribute to the skin looking dull and lifeless. Hydra-Hyal from Filorga is a lightweight, fast-absorbing serum that restores radiance, plumps, and firms the skin using five types of hyaluronic acid. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nFilorga rating: 4.8/5 stars \n“The light, fragrant smell initially threw me off, but after massaging this gel-like formula into my skin, all my worries vanished. My skin drinks this serum up, as it melts into my skin and gives me a fresh-out-the-spa glow. Plus, it's formula works well with my Solawave—A+ in my book!”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor \nRadiant, bright skin has always been one of Dr. Dennis Gross’s top goals for its consumers. Thankfully, the brand doesn’t skimp on products that address those concerns, especially regarding this hyaluronic acid serum. A powerful blend of hyaluronic acid, ceramides, watermelon extract, and more skin-saving ingredients work hard to improve the skin’s appearance.\nSize: 1 fl oz \nNordstrom star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nA Nordstrom reviewer said: “I received a sample of this and was a little skeptical, especially due to the price - how much could this really do for me? It turns out, it can do a lot! Just a few drops and my skin felt so balanced and soft - this seems to moisturize all the layers of your skin. Dr. Dennis Gross’s products are pretty effective. I do hope this comes back into stock soon!”\nUsing too many active ingredients can weaken your skin’s barrier, so Skinfix formulated the perfect antidote. The creamy solution soothes the skin and protects the barrier without disrupting the work of the other actives in your routine.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I love this product. This serum manages to hydrate my extremely dehydrated skin without feeling heavy. I ended up buying the lotion and face cream as well. But I feel like if you have dehydrated skin and could only use one of their products, this would be it.”\nThis serum from The Inkey List costs as much as your morning latte and gives your skin a fresh, wide-awake look and feel. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer said: “This hyaluronic acid serum is super hydrating, and you can’t beat the price point! A little goes a long way with this serum. I use it as part of my morning and bedtime skincare regimen, and I love it!”\nCrow’s feet, dry patches, and other terrors threaten our journey to glowy skin. Skinceuticals whipped together hyaluronic acid, licorice root, and proxylane to maintain the skin’s elasticity and smooth over any harsh lines or wrinkles.  \nSize: 1 fl oz\nDermstore star rating: 4.76/5 stars\nA Dermstore reviewer said: “I love this product for its hydrating properties, but really it goes above and beyond hydration. Excellent overall serum!”\nBeyond its pretty pink packaging, there is a lot to love about this serum. Antioxidants and proteins support hyaluronic acid to provide maximum plumpness and hydration. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn ELLE editor says: “Not all hyaluronic acids are the same (obviously, you the person who is reading this, knows this, hence why you're scrolling through this article.) I learned a few years ago that hyaluronic acids have different weights, and much like a stock portfolio, you want variation for your balance in your skin. This one contains five different weighted ones, as well as vegan silk protein. I like that this feels like a substantial, thick serum, and putting it on gives my skin an instantly glossiness, plus nourished feeling. It has a slight fruity scent too, so it feels like I'm giving my skin a treat.”   — Kathleen Hou, Beauty Director, ELLE\nIf smooth skin is what you’re after, L’Oreal’s Revitalift serum delivers that and then some. Each use rejuvenates the skin and reveals a youthful glow.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I use this every morning and night. I have about 3 different serums and recently bought this one and it [is] my absolute favorite. I returned 2 of the other serums for a refund because I love this one so much.”\nAll skin types can benefit from this La Roche-Posay serum, which combines the powerful benefits of hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 to slow signs of aging and boost hydration. \nSize: 1 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn ELLE editor says: “I just finished a bottle of this serum. I love to travel with it as it leaves my skin super hydrated and absorbs quickly into my skin. It plays well with my other products and have never experienced pilling, which makes for a smoother morning skin care routine.” — Danielle James, Digital Beauty Director, ELLE\nDry, dull skin doesn’t stand a chance against this serum, which is formulated with hyaluronic acid and proteins to turn back the hands of time so your skin stays youthful longer.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “Hands down the best serum I’ve used— and I’ve used a lot! It is a small fortune; however, it’s worth every penny.”\nStrawberries taste great in smoothies. However, many are unaware of its great skincare benefits, as they are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Eminence puts strawberries to the test in its  Hyaluronic Hydrator serum, a lightweight serum packed with the delicious fruit and rhubarb to fight premature aging.\nSize: 1.2 fl oz\nDermstore star rating: 5/5 stars\nA Dermstore reviewer said: “Super lightweight and smells amazing! It makes my skin so soft and plump looking. I wash my face in the morning and put this on and it keeps my face hydrated all day without it feeling oily. It works great with other serums/lotions and makeup. Definitely try it!!!”\nB5 and hyaluronic acid join forces to drench your skin in hydration so well that you’ll want to stock up on more. Good thing it costs less than $15.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Yes, this is the real deal. Finally, a skincare product I can tell works, and I now buy [it] regularly. My skin literally drinks this in like a sponge in a puddle of water. A dime-sized drop of this covered my entire face and was immediately absorbed. Works beautifully and easily in my facial regimen.”\nFake a glow-from-within look with Neutrogena’s cult-favorite Hydro Boost serum. The formula locks in moisture to treat the driest of skin.\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This moisturizer is amazing! The smell of it is refreshing, and it took some time to get used to, but now I love the smell. It’s the softest I’ve ever felt my skin, even when I get occasional breakouts. One pump is enough for the whole face; worth my buy!”\nWhile it’s not the typical packaging for a serum, the Isdin hyaluronic acid ampoules give your skin just the right amount of magic with each tube. The booster comprises two different forms of hyaluronic banding together for one goal: maximum hydration. \nSize: 10 ampoules (2ml) \nIsdin star rating: 5/5 stars\nAn Isdin reviewer said: “I love how my skin feels tighter. Easy to use. I get two days of liquid before using [the] next ampoule.”\nEvery skincare newbie needs a place to start. Enter: Cerave’s affordable line of simple skincare, including this gentle serum that glides on like butter and soothes dehydrated skin. This fragrance and oil-free formula protects the skin barrier, making it an excellent serum for eczema-prone skin. \nSize: 1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “This serum is better than two other more expensive ones I’ve tried. It makes my sensitive skin feel soft and look brighter without any irritation. It even made a seborrheic keratosis growth on my hairline almost disappear after only a couple of weeks.”\nThink of hyaluronic acid as a serum that helps your skin preserve moisture—the good kind. “[Hyaluronic acid] attracts and binds water; it is ideal to combine a hyaluronic acid serum and a moisturizer,” Dr. Howard says.\n“It is important to think of the order you apply your products,” she adds. When using skincare products, apply each formula from lightest to thickest consistency. “First, you would cleanse your face. Next, apply your hyaluronic acid serum and then follow with a moisturizer,” Dr. Howard explains.\n“Yes, you can use a hyaluronic acid serum daily. My advice is to take a look at the ingredient list of your other products as they may also be formulated with hyaluronic acid,” she says. Hyaluronic acid is a team player and pairs well with other humectants and actives.\nDr. Camille Howard, NYC-based dermatologist and founder of Girl+Hair\nNerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.

Through some incredibly innovative DIY techniques and home renovation inspiration, Hack My Home makes even the smallest of rooms more functional again, which is fun to see.\nWATCH NOW\nLauren Conrad and Heidi Montag's feud defined a generation (“I wanna forgive you and I wanna forget you”), and over a decade later, the late '00s series still holds up. From the birth of Speidi to Justin Bobby wearing combat boots to the beach to Brody Jenner's faux relationship drama with just about everyone, The Hills remains a reality TV staple. Sure, The Hills: New Beginnings already got canceled, but that's even more reason to return to where it all started. \nWATCH NOW\nNetflix's Selling Sunset was an instant smash hit, and it's easy to see why. The glossy real estate show is as much about decadent properties as it is girl gang drama and flawless hair and makeup. Christine Quinn's beef with Chrishell Stause kickstarted the series, which is already in its fifth season. We hope it never ends. \nWATCH NOW\nIt's hard to believe that people haven't gotten wise to online scammers after watching an impressive eight seasons of MTV's Catfish, but here we are. Nēv Schulman and Kamie Crawford make every episode entertaining, whether they're exposing con artists abroad or uncovering decade-long liars. And you can always go back to where it all began with the 2010 documentary Catfish, that tells Nēv's own internet romance disaster. \nWATCH NOW\nAfter 20 seasons on E!, the Kardashian-Jenner clan decided it was time for a change (and reportedly, a more lucrative deal). Cue Hulu's The Kardashians, a ludicrously glossy way for us all to watch Kravis make out, Kimye get divorced, and Khloé move the hell on from Tristan once and for all. We can't wait! \nWATCH NOW \nThe looks! The fashion! The shade! With 14 seasons and several spinoffs in the books (so far), Drag Race remains one of the most thrilling reality shows on television, as queens from all walks of life compete for the title of “next drag superstar” under the guidance of Mama Ru.

Amateur investors organized primarily on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets faced off against Wall Street's hedge funds. Disgusted with market manipulation by some of the richest people in the world, they supported the struggling video game retailer and caused its stock price to climb astronomically. The hedge funds lost money and the response from financial institutions exposed the hypocrisy in the system. If you gleaned some details from social media at the time, this film will fill in the blanks and then some.\nWatch Here\nThe FLDS (Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) is a secretive and highly insular world, and Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey gives a rare, deep look into the church for outsiders. The polygamous sect broke away from the mainstream Mormon Church long ago and were under the rule of charismatic leader, Warren Jeffs. Interviews with people who escaped FLDS include their personal experiences of arranged marriages and systemic abuse within the community. The picture of religious extremism is dark, but the survivors ability to transform and thrive is inspirational.\nWatch Now\nIn the 1980s, the Rajneeshpuram commune, a controversial spiritual community, consumed a swathe of rural Oregon.

You'll be quickly absorbed in the inner workings of the commune and figuring out who the real villains and heroes of the story were.\nWatch Now\nDirected by the acclaimed filmmaker Martin Scorsese, the docuseries Pretend It's a City follows author and humorist, Fran Lebowitz, as she walks the streets of her favorite place on earth.

The documentary shares their intimate interactions over an entire year and Foster honors his new friend's intelligence, resilience, and beauty in the clips he catches of her life. His octopus teacher profoundly increases his appreciation for the ocean and the film illustrates our connection to it, and all marine life, as fellow living creatures. \nWatch Now\nDisclosure explores the portrayal of transgender people in film and television through interviews with activists, performers, and scholars. In addition to being a fascinating historical analysis of cinema at large, it shows how cisgender actors are commonly promoted to play trans characters, often relying on caricatures and stigmatizing portrayals. The doc makes a clear case for why real representation matters on every level, from social to economic to political.\nWatch Now\nPamela Anderson's life story has been a subject of much scrutiny and often used without her permission for sensational stories and other people's profit.

It includes intimate interviews and appearances from her kids, and most importantly, Anderson's permission.\nWatch Now\nCharles Cullen worked for 16 years as a nurse in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and killed as many as 40 people in nine different hospitals.

He was finally taken in with the help of another nurse, Amy Loughren, who got a confession out of her former friend. This doc was additionally fictionalized on Netflix in The Good Nurse, starring Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne.\nWatch Now\nGirl in the Picture is a true-crime documentary that covers the story of Tonya Hughes, also called Sharon Marshall. Tonya was kidnapped by Franklin Delano Floyd, who raised her as his daughter—before marrying her. Tonya was allegedly killed by a hit-and-run driver in Oklahoma City in 1990, leaving behind a son named Michael. Michael was taken out of Floyd's charge, and it was discovered he was not the boy's biological father. This started an unraveling of Floyd's many crimes, and the fact he had been on the run as a fugitive from Georgia since 1973. \nWatch Now\nThis doc offers a behind-the-scenes look at Jennifer Lopez's halftime performance at Super Bowl LIV in 2020 alongside Shakira. The film incorporates the personal and professional challenges J.Lo faced in the lead-up to the performance, including the intense scrutiny of the media and the pressure to deliver an incredibly memorable show. \nWatch Now\nDr. James Marion Sims was a prominent fertility doctor who exploited and abused his patients for decades, violating their trust by using his own sperm to impregnate them without their consent.

But then she met a man. This docuseries is about how Melngailis fell for the manipulations of Shane Fox, a guy who promised immortality for her and her dog.

This film covers the beginnings of the movement with interviews from queer people who now admit they never changed, and why it's so important to come forward decades later.\nWatch Now\nThe infamous Simon Leviev was a pro at making women trust him after matching on the dating app Tinder. He claimed to be the heir to a diamond mogul and was seemingly able to back up these claims with outrageous displays of wealth. Then, all of the sudden, he'd need a little loan. While you might scream in frustration watching woman after woman get taken in by Leviev, the doc does explain how anyone could get taken in by a conscienceless scammer under the right circumstances.\nWatch Now\nJohn Wayne Gacy is a very well-known serial killer, partly because he was so prolific (he killed over men in about a four year timespan) and because he dressed up as a clown. But if you want to delve deeper than these two very striking facts, this doc goes very deep into Gacy's history and includes new audio of the murderer talking with his defense team about his reasons for killing, and how he got away with it for so long.\nWatch Now\nThe models for Abercrombie & Fitch might be nice to look at, but this documentary delves into the unsexy side of the century-old company. If you grew up in the nineties, looking at the history of the store's rise and fall will bring back a lot of memories. And if you didn't, this will give you a deeper understanding of fashion, trends, and how ugly things can get in the retail market.\nWatch Now\nMost people associate Bob Ross with “happy little trees,” but the behind-the-scenes story paints a very different picture. This doc won't ruin your image of Mr. Ross, thank goodness, but it will shine a light on the destructive effect money can have on people after the person they loved is gone.\nWatch Now \nAre you a royal family follower solely for the conspiracy theories associated with the Windsors?

You'll become an expert on the title subjects—and want to cook and eat everything.\nWatch Now\nFilmmaker Coodie has been following Kanye West since the advent of his career, long before his recent controversies, so the doc contains the sort of intimate footage most music biographers can only dream about. The three-part series contains so many details about one man's path to world-wide fame and fortune, and all the ups-and-downs such a journey entails. \nWatch Now\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Travis Kelce Says He Feels ‘On Top of the World’ as Taylor Swift Romance Progresses", "date": "2023-10-07 15:11:00", "text": "On Friday, Travis Kelce was grilled about his budding relationship with pop star Taylor Swift, and he had nothing but good news to share. The Kansas City Chiefs player came out for an interview at the team's practice facility, sharing how it feels to be at the center of so much speculation.\n“As all the attention comes it feels like, you know, I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl and right now even more on top of the world,” he told reporters. “It's fun.”\nSwift has attended two games to see her rumored love interest, one at Arrowhead Stadium and another last weekend at MetLife Stadium, where the Chiefs faced off against the New York Jets. At the October 1 game, she brought friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sabrina Carpenter, Sophie Turner, and Hugh Jackman, adding to the spectacle. These appearances have sparked even more intense interest in the potential couple.\n“We're learning with the paparazzi just taking photos from all over the place, but at the same time it comes with it,” Kelce continued. “You got a lot of people that care about Taylor and for good reason.”\nVideo of everything Travis Kelce said today about Taylor Swift, Pfizer backlash, his b-day and focusing on football:\"I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl, and now even more so.\"\"You've got a lot of people that care about Taylor, for good reason.\" #ChiefsKingdom @KCTV5 pic.twitter.com/qIRzyAleAd\nHe added, “Just gotta keep living and learning and enjoying the moments. At the end of the day, I've always been pretty good about compartmentalizing and being able to stay focused in this building. So I'll just keep rolling with that.”\nSome NFL fans have expressed annoyance on social media about the Swift mania, suggesting it's a distraction from the game. However, Kelce said he is only interested in the opinion of his teammates, and they are supposedly enjoying the attention as well. \n“Everybody's having fun with it, you know? Whether I think they're overdoing it or not, I know I brought this to myself,” he said. “I've been fortunate enough to have with it.

{"title": "Julia Fox States Kanye West ‘Weaponized’ Her Against the Kardashians When They Dated", "date": "2023-10-07 16:18:00", "text": "With the imminent release of her memoir, Down the Drain, Julia Fox has been sharing more details of her personal life that have caused a lot of conjecture before, particularly about her relationship with Kanye West. In an interview on Friday with The Los Angeles Times, Fox shared that when she and the rapper were linked in 2022, she felt he “weaponized” her against his former wife, Kim Kardashian. \n“I thought ultimately I’d be helping a precarious situation, but I learned very quickly that I was being weaponized,” she claimed.\nShe added that she “really understood” West “on a visceral level” and thought their connection “could be something real,” but he did not treat her as she expected to be treated.\nFox stated, “I just felt like his little puppet.”\nThe memoir will share some more details on the time she spent with West, though she says she “went lightly” on him. However, she never signed a non-disclosure agreement.\n“I’m not signing a f-cking NDA just on principle,” she said. “I never have, and I never will... Unless it’s a professional opportunity, then sure.”\nWest and Fox only dated briefly, but she still said she believes that the relationship interfered with certain opportunities. The rapper was himself dropped from a number of brand deals following his very public anti-Semitic comments.\n“I know for a fact I’ve been up for certain things and couldn’t do it because of dating Kanye. It’s kind of wild,” she said. “It really wasn’t that big of a deal, but other people made it such a big deal.”\nAfter they broke it off, Fox said she stopped dating for a while. She focused on her two-year-old son Valentino, who she shares with ex-husband Peter Artemiev.\n“That romanticized idea of men doesn’t exist anymore,” she said. “All the validation I could ever get, I get from my son—the love, the intimacy, the closeness. We co-sleep at night. I have all of that. I wouldn’t want anyone to come in and take my attention or time away from my son.” \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Rihanna Wears Tie-Front Top With Denim Ensemble on Date With A$AP Rocky", "date": "2023-10-07 17:35:00", "text": "On Friday, Rihanna stepped out with boyfriend A$AP Rocky in New York City. The couple were spotted leaving a hotel together in their early fall looks. The Fenty Beauty founder was wearing a tie-front top that offered a glimpse of her torso and a peek at her lacy black bra where the shirt's low neckline was unbuttoned. Over it, she wore a denim jacket with the shirt's cuffs hanging out and wide-legged jeans in the same wash. \nOn her feet were a pair of black heels, and she accessorized with earrings, some chains around her neck, and black sunglasses. Rihanna's hair hung in slight waves around her, and she flashed a red manicure.\nThe rapper also wore a matching jacket and slacks, both in a loose summer cut in a beige shade. Under the jacket he wore a white tee, and over one shoulder A$AP carried a woven green leather purse. He also had on sunglasses, a chain necklace and wore black boots. \nThe parents welcomed their first son, RZA Athelston Mayers, in May of 2022. Their second child came just a few months ago, another son who they reportedly named Riot. \nAfter her first child was born, Rihanna told British Vogue that the experience “was beautiful” and that she felt “blessed,” but it was still a huge transition. \n“Essentially, from one person I became two,” she said. “You walk into the hospital as a couple and leave as a family of three. It’s nuts.”\nShe added that “you don't sleep. At all. Not even if you wanted to.”\n“We came home, cold turkey, had no one,” the ANTI singer went on. “It was just us as parents and our baby. Man, you're a zombie for the most part.”\nWhen asked about her notably excellent maternity style, Rihanna said it was much harder to figure out how to dress postpartum.\n“Dressing for pregnancy was such a piece of cake,” she said. “But dressing in postpartum, what the f-ck do you do? The week that I came home from the hospital—that was nothing but sweats and hoodies.”\nShe continued, “You kind of just gotta wait it out otherwise you end up buying so many clothes you’re not going to use. Well, unless you get pregnant again.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Sofia Vergara Is 'Doing Great' After Split From Joe Manganiello", "date": "2023-10-07 19:34:00", "text": "On Friday, Sofia Vergara's good friend Julie Bowen spoke with People while attending the Step Up Inspiration Awards and was asked about her Modern Family co-star of 11 years. Bowen said that she will “always” support her friend, and that she has been seeing Vergara thrive after her breakup with Joe Manganiello.\n“Her Instagram says it all,” Bowen claimed. “We have spoken, and she's doing great. Sofia has always had such a wonderful family that surrounds her and wonderful friends,” before adding jokingly, “She doesn't need Taylor Swift to take her to a game.” \nBowen added, “She's good. But I'm super happy that all those other girls are going to games with T Swifty. I wish she had been around for me.”\nShe shared more about their longstanding working relationship and the close friendship that developed over their many years together on the hugely popular ABC sitcom.\n“Sofia has always been my role model as far as embracing being a woman and womanly, and yet also being powerful and not,” said Bowen. “I always felt like you had to compromise one for the other.” \nThe actress has been asked about her friend quite a bit. In August, she told E! News that Vergara does everything “with grace.”\n“And she rises above and she just goes forward. She's warm and generous and giving to everybody around her,” Bowen continued. “I have no doubt that if she wishes to be in a relationship she will be, but she sure don't need one.”\nVergara and Manganiello were married for seven years, and split shortly before her 51st birthday, which she celebrated with friends in Italy and without her husband or wedding ring. Manganiello was the one who officially filed for divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\nIn a statement to Page Six, the former couple said, “We have made the difficult decision to divorce. As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect for our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.” \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Simone Biles Becomes the Most Decorated Gymnast Ever With Another Gold Medal", "date": "2023-10-07 20:57:00", "text": "On Friday, Olympic great Simone Biles broke yet another record with her win at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Belgium. The 26-year-old athlete was awarded her sixth all-around world championship gold, making her the most decorated gymnast ever. She was previously tied with Belarus gymnast Vitaly Scherbo, who competed in the 1990s and took home 33 medals. Biles is now at 34. \nIt was an emotional moment for Biles as she stood on the podium during the U.S. national anthem, alongside silver winner Rebeca Andrade and bronze winner Shilese Jones. Cameras caught her getting a bit misty-eyed while soaking in the accolades.\n“I was emotional because it was my first worlds here, 10 years ago, and then now my sixth one, so it's crazy,” Biles told reporters after the competition. “But I swear, I do have something in my eye that's been bothering me for like four hours and I cannot get it out… So while I was looking up there, it was like a combination of both.”\nWe're not crying, you're crying. 🥹The national anthem plays for 6-time world all-around champion Simone Biles. 🇺🇸🥇 pic.twitter.com/pp0PQ65KSV\nThe champion's success is particularly poignant this year. She only returned to competing this summer after stepping back following the 2020 Olympic Games, which were held in Tokyo in 2021. At the time, Biles was experiencing something gymnasts call the “twisties,” a very dangerous change in perception that makes it extremely difficult to land safely when doing their gravity-defying moves in the air. That year, she withdrew from some events effected by the condition, but won bronze at the balance beam final.\nDuring the world championships, Biles has earned two golds so far, including one during the U.S. team final on Wednesday, and she is still set to compete in the women's vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor routine. She will likely make her return to the Olympics in Paris which are set for 2024. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

The film's stars, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert, were spotted shooting a commercial on a football field dressed in pink, a nod to their characters from the movie. Lohan played Cady Heron in the 2004 film, a naive girl moving to a U.S. high school after growing up in Africa and finding it difficult to navigate a new social hierarchy.\nSeyfried and Chabert were a part of “The Plastics,” the most popular clique in school who accept Cady into the fold, only to find their status quickly disintegrating. Their leader was played by Rachel McAdams as the notorious Regina George, but McAdams did not appear to be on set. \nChabert was photographed in a silver convertible very similar to the one she drove in the original movie, and in another picture Seyfried is talking into a microphone. In Mean Girls, she does the school weather reports. In another photo, Lohan was carrying a bag that reads, “Plastics Club Member,” and the tagline, “On Wednesdays, we wear pink.”\nNext year is the 20th anniversary of the movie and it was recently October 3, a date that has a joking significance in the script and which the cast has often marked on social media since its release. Next year is also when Mean Girls Musical Movie is set to hit theaters, an adaptation of the musical of the movie. The new movie and the original were penned by Tina Fey, and she'll be reprising her role as Ms. Norbury in the adaptation. \nThe gals have been asked about the likelihood they'd make a cameo in the new Mean Girls and in February, Seyfried told Entertainment Tonight that she was “100 percent into” making an appearance.\n“It's been a long legacy for Mean Girls, and I think we all kinda just need to hang,” she said. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Rami Malek and Emma Corrin’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-08 15:37:00", "text": "Rami Malek has found love again with Emma Corrin after his years-long relationship with Lucy Boynton came to a quiet end. The two actors made their romance very official when they were photographed kissing on September 21 in London.\nThe PDA display comes after the couple was seen together at the US Open, and a source told People in August that Malek started seeing Corrin, who uses they/them pronouns, earlier in the summer. He “has fun” with them, the insider said.\nHere, a breakdown of their history together.\nMalek, 42, and Corrin, 27, are seen together at a Bruce Springsteen concert in London’s Hyde Park. At this point, his breakup from Lucy Boynton hasn’t been confirmed. \nMalek and Corrin appeared talking close to each other in paparazzi photos from the mid-July concert. Page Six reported that, at one point, Malek rested his hand on Corrin’s knee.\nOn August 4, The Sun reported Malek and Boynton’s breakup. A source said that since the breakup, Malek has been spending time with friends, including Corrin. In fact, he asked them out to the Springsteen concert.\n“Rami and Lucy split earlier this year without much fanfare,” the source said. “They were together for a long time but had grown apart. They are both moving on with their lives and are busy with work. Rami has surrounded himself with his mates and has spent the summer enjoying himself. He asked Emma to join him to watch Bruce at BST last month, and they had a great time. Rami is enjoying life and living it up.”\nThe Sun reported that Malek and Corrin were seen by fans kissing in a restaurant and holding hands on a walk. Photos of them at dinner were published on the outlet, too.\nTheir walk happened earlier in August in North London. A witness told The Sun, “They looked very much like a couple.”\nTheir dinner date was at Buoy and Oyster restaurant in Margate, Kent. An eyewitness there told the outlet that they were quite affectionate.\n“Rami and Emma were very low-key and when fans approached them for pictures, they politely declined,” the source said. “They were very passionate and looking into each other’s eyes. They kissed and didn’t seem to mind who could see. Rami and Emma just seemed totally besotted with each other and paid no attention to anyone else.”\nMalek and Corrin took their romance to New York City. The couple was seen sitting next to each other at the September 8 matches. They did not show PDA in the pics.\nCorrin and Malek made their romance public when paparazzi caught them kissing while they were on a walk in London. An onlooker told Daily Mail that they were “blissfully happy and in love [and] weren’t trying to be discreet or hide their relationship at all.” Corrin wore a tan trench coat, light wash jeans, and a black top. Malek was in an olive sweater, blue baseball cap, and jeans. See photos here. \nThe couple were photographed walking along a beach in Kent on Thursday, September 28, leading Corrin's dog Spencer. Malek leaned over to give his partner a kiss on the cheek, then wrapped an arm around them. Later, they played fetch with the pup.\nBoth were dressed in warm layers, with Malek in a black sweater and a coat over a long white shirt with a collar. He had on baggy jeans, a white baseball cap, and sunglasses. Corrin wore a dark green sweater vest over a lighter green shirt with jeans and a black cross body bag.\nOn Tuesday, October 3, Malek and Corrin made an appearance at the Miu Miu afterparty in Paris during fashion week. They were wearing outfits in black and gray, seemingly coordinated for the night out. In photos of the couple taken as they left the event, they're both smiling and Malek has his hand on Corrin's back in a sweet gesture.\nIn another picture, they posed with Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson's Relationship", "date": "2023-10-08 15:49:00", "text": "Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson were first linked together in 2016, and have had many ups and downs during the past six years. In that time, they had two children together, a four-year-old daughter named True Thompson and a boy born via surrogate in summer 2022. His name has not yet been revealed publicly. \nRelationship status-wise, Kardashian and Thompson are off for now but have been on-off romantically throughout their history.\nIf you've found their relationship confusing, this timeline of their big moments together might help to keep everything straight. \nAugust 2016\nKhloé and Tristan were first spotted together leaving LA's Bootsy Bellows nightclub in the summer of 2016. Khloé later explained that they were set up on a surprise blind date by their mutual friend Brandon Jennings.\n“I was at the Bel-Air hotel. [Tristan] came to the dinner because I didn't want to go on a blind date, so Brandon kind of ambushed the blind date,” she said. “So, I had a bunch of people, and he brought him, and we just connected.”\nSeptember 2016\nA month later,  Khloé and Tristan headed to Mexico for a couple's getaway and were photographed holding hands in Miami that same month, eventually attending Flo Rida’s birthday party at LIV together.\nOctober 2016\nIn October, the couple coordinated their costumes for Halloween, going as Marvel's Storm and the Black Panther.\nNovember 2016\nBy November of that year, Khloé was living part-time in Cleveland to be close to Tristan, which she raved about during an interview with Jimmy Kimmel.\n“I live [in Los Angeles], but I’m [in Cleveland] very often,” she said. “I actually really do [like being in Cleveland]. I actually really like it. I like just having my routine and being a little more under the radar. It’s nice.”\nDecember 2016\nIn December, Khloé shared a photo of herself and Tristan in matching camouflage coats, embracing in a hallway. She captioned the photo, “Him,” adding a heart emoji.\nJanuary 2017\nThe couple celebrated the new year together, kissing at midnight and sharing the pics on Instagram.\nMarch 2017\nBy 2017, Tristan was showing up in episodes of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. During his first appearance, he was at Khloé's side when she headed to a Kanye West concert to meet the family, annoying her sister Kim Kardashian.\nApril 2017\nIn an interview with Es Magazine, Khloé said she had “never been in this type of love.” \n“I would love to have a family. We’ve talked about it … I know for a fact that he would be an impeccable father,” she said. “I definitely want to be a mom. But I don’t put the pressure on it. It’s not like, ‘The clock is ticking.’ I feel in my soul it will happen.”\nJune 2017\nIn June, Khloé posted more kissing pics with Tristan, calling him her “king.”\nAugust 2017\nShe went with a kissing pic again to celebrate their one year anniversary.\nDecember 2017\nThe couple announced that they were expecting in late 2017.\n“My greatest dream realized!” Khloé wrote on Instagram. “We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can't believe that our love created life! Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!!”\nShe continued, “You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned! I will never forget how wonderful you've been to me during this time! Thank you for making me so happy my love! Thank you to everyone for the love and positive vibes! I know we've been keeping this quiet but we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately. To enjoy our first precious moments just us. Thank you all for understanding. I am so thankful, excited, nervous, eager, overjoyed and scared all in one! But it's the best bundle of feelings I've ever felt in my life!”\nJanuary 2018\nTo celebrate the beginning of another new year together, Khloé posted a picture of her and Tristan captioned “mom and dad.”\nFebruary 2018\nThe couple had a huge Valentine's Day celebration together just months before the birth of True.\nOn April 12, 2018, True was born, but the huge event was somewhat overshadowed by videos of Tristan appearing on TMZ and the Daily Mail, showing him being intimate with another woman. The story broke just before True's birth, and Page Six identified the woman Tristan was seen kissing at PH-D Lounge in NYC as 28-year-old model Lani Blair.\nBlair was reportedly seen at his NBA team's hotel, the Four Seasons, and spent “four hours” there before they headed to Soho House together, then returned to the hotel around 5 A.M. the next morning.\nWitnesses told Page Six that Thompson was “looking around cautiously…and holding the door for her” at the hotel. Blair was later seen leaving on Monday night 8 P.M. with a Louis Vuitton overnight bag.\nShortly after The Mail's story was released, TMZ produced another video dated from back in October, of Thompson with two other women.\nThe next month,  it was reported that Khloé and Tristan were trying to work things out. The new parents were spotted at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland as Tristan's team the Cavaliers played against the Toronto Raptors, TMZ reported.\nKhloe Kardashian Shows Up at Cavaliers Game to Support Tristan Thompson https://t.co/FZeCm8FXKQ\nThey were also spotted having lunch at TownHall restaurant in Cleveland.\nPeople reported Tristan and Khloé were together again in the house, with a source saying, “Khloé seems happy. She loves being a mom. She’s focused on keeping her family together. She seems okay with Tristan—there’s no talk of a split.”\n“When she wants something to work, she will make it work,” the source explained. “Her family’s issue with Tristan is that they think he won’t change. But Khloé isn’t listening to this. She has been very firm with Tristan, and she believes he wants to keep his family together as well.”\nKhloé commented for the first time on Twitter about her relationship in response to a fan wondering why she didn't leave “that wasteman Tristan.” The fan wrote, “She preaches about women knowing their self worth and when to walk away, but when it's time to walk the walk, she's a hypocrite.”\nKardashian responded directly to the fan, tweeting, “Not exactly Queen Persia, you have no knowledge of what goes on in our household or the enormous rebuilding this takes to even coexist. I’m proud of my strength. I appreciate your opinion and I hope you hold that same opinion to everyone else who has stayed in situations.” \nThings apparently were rocky, with an insider telling People and Us Weekly that Khloé and Tristan were together but growing apart.\n“Khloé and Tristan are still not fully okay,” Us’ source said. “They act like they are when they’re in front of others, but it’s all a show at this point.”\nA second source told Us that Tristan was unhappy. \n“Tristan is feeling trapped in a bad relationship. He’s no longer going with Khloé for [couple’s therapy] sessions. He just didn’t feel it was helping to discuss sh-t that happened months ago.”\nKhloé was frustrated too, according to the source.\n“Khloé carried his child and is much more in the limelight than he is, and she doesn’t think he understands the consequences of his decisions,” the source explained. \"She thinks the cheating scandal is a way bigger deal than he does, and he doesn’t fully understand the repercussions of his actions affecting not only him and Khloé but the entire family as a whole.\"\nShe was particularly sensitive because her ex-husband Lamar Odom was guilty of the same transgression. A source told People that Tristan was having trouble adjusting to being in the limelight.\n“When he got with Khloé, he tried to adapt to the best of his ability, but he struggled with being part of such a high-profile family and crossed lines he shouldn’t have,” People's source said. “He wasn’t expecting such major backlash from the public and it’s been a lot for him to handle.”\nKhloé spent Thanksgiving in Cleveland with Tristan and True, away from her family. Fans were suspicious that the Kardashians and Jenner don't want him around. \nShe responded to that by tweeting, “Y’all are reaching now. I’ve spent the past 3 years in Cleveland for Thanksgiving. Not sure why people are trying to create drama between my family and I. My sisters and I are perfectly fine thank you! All of their families were able to travel but TT being in season, he can not.”\nY’all are reaching now. I’ve spent the past 3years in Cleveland for Thanksgiving. Not sure why people are trying to create drama between my family and I. My sisters and I are perfectly fine thank you! All of their families were able to travel but TT being in season, he can not\nShe later added, “The truth is never as fun as some story some of you like to create. So here we goooooooooooo!! Happy Thanksgiving I guess lol.”\nTMZ reports that the couple had split over allegations that Tristan was seen kissing Jordyn Woods, Kylie Jenner's best friend at the time, just after spending Valentine's Day with Khloé.\nThe basketball star was reportedly seen “snuggling up” and “making out” with Jordyn Woods at a house party, and when Khloé found out, the source said, “she has had enough.”\n“FAKE NEWS,” Tristan initially tweeted just after the news broke.\nThe week before, E! reported that though they were technically together, it didn't necessarily look good.\n“She chooses not to worry about it or to classify their relationship anymore,” E!'s source explained, saying Khloé was mostly in Los Angeles while Tristan toured with his team, and that she is “very happy with things the way they are and feels very fulfilled. She doesn't need to think about what's up with Tristan or what he's doing out on the road like she used to.” \nLater that month, Woods appeared on Red Table Talk episode with Jada Pinkett Smith for Facebook Watch, where she described her encounter with him. She said, “But, on the way out [of Tristan's house] he did kiss me. No passion, no nothing. On the way out he just kissed me. It was a kiss on the lips. No tongue kiss, no making out. Nothing. I don't think he's wrong either, because I allowed myself to be in this position.”\nShe continued, “I didn't know how to feel. I was like, ‘That didn't just happen,’ because I was leaving already so I walked out immediately after. And I got in the car and was like, ‘No, that didn't happen,’ I [told him] I need to go. I was in shock.”\nKhloé tweeted out that she did not blame Woods the way she blamed Tristan for what happened.\nTristan is equally to blame but Tristan is the father of my child. Regardless of what he does to me I won’t do that to my daughter. He has been addressing this situation PRIVATELY. If Tristan were to lie publicly about what conspired,then yes I would address him publicly as well\nThis has been an awful week & I know everyone is sick of hearing about it all (as am I). I’m a rollercoaster of emotions & have said things I shouldn’t have. Honestly, Tristan cheating on me & humiliating me, wasn’t such a shock as the first time.\nWhat’s been harder & more painful is being hurt by someone so close to me. Someone whom I love & treat like a little sister. But Jordyn is not to be blamed for the breakup of my family. This was Tristan’s fault.\nI have to move on with my life & count my blessings, my family, my health, & my beautiful baby True.\nPeople interviewed a source who said that Khloé is “great.”\n“Her heartbreak seems to have passed and her mood is much lighter,” they continued. “Although she really wanted Tristan to come around, grow up and be a man, she seems to have realized that she’s much better off now. Everyone is happy to see her happier.”\nThey added, “Khloé isn’t dating, but at least she’s able to talk and joke about dating. She realizes with True around now, she just needs to be super picky. True [Kardashian's daughter with Thompson] will always be Khloé’s life and number one. Khloé is obsessed with her little girl. She really is the most wonderful mom.”\nTristan spoke out against rumors that his relationship with Khloé overlapped with his and ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig's relationship. Craig was pregnant with the couple's child Prince when he first started seeing Khloé.\n“When I met Khloe I was SINGLE,” he wrote on Twitter. “The negative comments that are constantly being directed towards her are unnecessary. She does not deserve all this backlash for my wrong doings. Both Khloè and Jordan have been nothing but great mothers to my kids.”\nDuring a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest, Khloe stated that she doesn’t hold a grudge against her ex or Jordyn Woods.\n“I’m not someone who holds a grudge. If I do that it’s only going to affect me,” she said. “That chapter is closed for me. I want all of us to move on and to be happy, successful people. I just want everyone to just be better people with each day. That’s genuinely how I feel.”\nShe added, “I know everybody makes mistakes. I think it’s how you handle it, and I think apologies need to be as loud as your disrespect was or to me, it’s not sincere. I’m forgiving. I’m forgiven.” \n“We’re all human beings and we’re all figuring out life,” she said. “Stuff happens and people make mistakes, and as long as it doesn’t define who they are—as long as they don’t make those choices define them and they try to evolve and become better people—we’re all gonna survive. We all learn from it.”\nIn July of the following year after spending some time in lockdown together, it was rumored by People that the former couple was “giving their relationship another try. Tristan is working hard to prove himself and has been a great dad to True.”\nA second source said they “acted like [they] were back together” during her birthday that summer, and he wrote a glowing tribute to her on social media.\n\"I’m wise enough now to know, you came into my life to show me just what it means to be an incredible person,\" he stated. \"I appreciate how I am able to learn from and grow because of you. I thank God for the beautiful and loving woman you are to everyone, especially our daughter True. You deserve the world Koko! True and I love you mama. Happy Birthday @khloekardashian ❤️🥳”\nBy February 2021, the pair were supposedly back in a committed relationship, and a source told Entertainment Tonight, “Khloé forgives Tristan at this point, but she will never forget. They are back to being committed, are still in love and giving their relationship another chance and hoping that it will succeed this time around. Tristan has been paying extra attention to Khloe and True and has been calling, FaceTiming, texting and sending photos all the time to check in when they are not physically together. He hasn’t been going out late at night with the boys or other girls.”\nA month later, they went Instagram official for a second time, with Khloé wishing him a happy 30th birthday today on Instagram.\nShe wrote to her boyfriend, “The ones that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is designed to tear them apart and they come out even stronger than they were before. Thank you for showing me everything you said you would. For the father you are. For the best friend I have in you. I’m thankful that I can do absolutely nothing with you and it feels like everything. I hope you know today and everyday how loved you are by me and so many. Happy birthday TT! Welcome to 30! I can’t wait for all of the memories. This is when life just starts getting good!”\nTristan was spotted entering a bedroom with three women at a party, and a source told Daily Mail that “Tristan took off into one of the party rooms where everyone goes to hook up” with the trio and another man. “They stayed in the room behind closed doors for at least 30 minutes. When he arrived, his shirt looked all pressed and when he came out his shirt was a mess, he looked disheveled.”\n A source spoke to E!, who said, “They had been working through the cheating rumors for the last couple of weeks, but Khloé told Tristan he lost all of her trust and the relationship could not be repaired. Khloé really tried, but ultimately, felt too betrayed by him. She's done and says she will not go back.”\nThey added, “They have been co-parenting and have seen each other several times in the last week with True, but are not romantically together.”\nThey continued to co-parent, with a source saying, “Khloé is doing okay. True will always be her first priority, and, ultimately, she's focused on a healthy family for her daughter, so Tristan will always be a part of Khloé's life.”\nThey added, “She's not one to dwell on the past—she has an incredible capacity to find the positive in every situation. And she and Tristan are still very much in touch and are great co-parents to True.”\nInTouch reported that they have reconciled once more, but Khloé denied it.\nThe Mirror shared  InTouch's report and a Twitter user retweeted the story, writing at Khloé, “At this point @khloekardashian has no self worth. Anyway...”\nShe responded, “You’re telling me you made an assessment about my life because of a random blog? I think that says more about you than it does about me.”\nYou’re telling me you made an assessment about my life because of a random blog? I think that says more about you than it does about me.\nAt some point in the following months, the couple seemingly reconciled again, but kept it very private considering their past. However, news came out that Tristan fathered a child with personal trainer Maralee Nichols, who was suing the basketball player for child support and other pregnancy-related fees.\nNichols alleged in court documents, according to People, that the baby was conceived in March of that year when Tristan and Khoé were still together.\nTristan confirmed in an Instagram Story that he was the father of Nichols' baby, and then publicly apologized to Khloé.\nHe wrote:\nKhloé and Tristan reveal they are expecting a second child together via surrogate, a rep told E! and People. \nThe rep said, “We can confirm True will have a sibling who was conceived in November. Khloé is incredibly grateful to the extraordinary surrogate for such a beautiful blessing. We’d like to ask for kindness and privacy so that Khloé can focus on her family.” \nThe baby was allegedly conceived before the Nichols scandal was revealed to Khloé and the public, likely in November 2021.\nKhloé and Tristan welcomed their second child together via surrogate, People reported, and it's a baby boy. \nBuzzfeed and Entertainment Tonight reported that the pair were secretly engaged when the Nichols news broke. She accepted his proposal in February 2021, a month before he cheated with Nichols. \nKhloé shared photos from her family's famous annual Christmas party, partially revealing her son's face for the first time, but not his name. The Kardashians star was wearing a red satin ballgown made custom by Lebanese designer Nicolas Jebran, with True wearing an outfit in a matching red.\nTristan's mother Andrea Thompson unexpectedly passed away on January 5 after having a heart attack. E! reported that Khloé flew to Toronto to support Tristan right after. “Khloe went with him to comfort and help him navigate what will be a very difficult time,” the source said. “She was incredibly close to his mother.”\nE!'s source explained that broken up or not, Khloé remains committed to supporting her ex and co-parent. “Like Khloé and the Kardashian family always do, they will come together and support their loved ones in their most difficult time of need,” the source said. “Tristan is the father of Khloe's kids, and she and her entire family will always be there for him.”\nKim Kardashian and Kris Jenner join Khloé and Tristan for the funeral on January 14, E! reported.\nKhloé paid tribute to Andrea on her Instagram, writing that she promised to look after Tristan's younger, teen brother Amari, who suffers from epilepsy.\nOn Friday, March 10, Khloé Kardashian celebrated her best friends Malika and Khadijah Haqq’s 40th birthday in Los Angeles. She was joined by sisters Kim and Kylie and their mom Kris Jenner. She was also joined by her ex. Thompson reportedly arrived two hours after the gals, but he was wearing sparkling silver sneakers that matched Khloé's silver minidress.\nHe and Khloé were also seen leaving the event at the same time, around 1 am, though they left through different exits. Khloé exited through the venue's back door, while Thompson left through the front. His appearance at Khloé's best friends' party and in a coordinated ensemble has fans wondering if there's another reconciliation rumor around the corner.\nKhloé later posted a birthday tribute to Thompson on March 13, 2023. She had to disable comments to her disappointment, and a source told Us Weekly on March 14 that the post did not mean they were back together.\nIn the tribute, Kardashian wrote, “Happy birthday @realtristan13. You are truly the best father, brother & uncle. Your love, attention, silly dances, hugs, carpool rides, bed time rituals, the way u show up for them. All of the above means more than you’ll ever know to your family of littles. My birthday wish for u is that u continue to crave change, healing, and transformation. Be strong, be kind, be patient, be free. Continue to Make your soul and your mommy proud. Happy birthday baby daddy.”\nA second source told the outlet a day later that Thompson would like to be with Kardashian again though. “Tristan is always trying to get Khloé back, he still loves her and wants to make it work between them,” the source said. “They’re friends and great coparents, but he wants more.” The source did not address Khloé's feelings about this.\nIn the June 8 episode of The Kardashians, Kardashian revealed some more details about how she and Thompson are handling their co-parenting duties in a conversation with Kris Jenner, saying boundaries are key.\n“Tristan and I, we always get along great,” she said. “Him and I have a great friendship relationship, we get along fine, and for my kids, I will put anything to the side.” \nShe continued, “What's done is done, so what would I still be holding on to something for? I don't need to ‘punish’ him because I'm not getting back with him.”\nJenner agrees that they seem to have figured out a system as co-parents. \n“When I'm not around, he's here,” Kardashian agreed. “I would rather him be here than the nanny.” \nShe continued, “There's still boundaries, I'm definitely putting my foot down around a lot of things. No one's just here chilling if there's no kids involved.”\nIn a later confessional, she explained more about why that was necessary. \n“These boundaries are so important to put into place with Tristan because we've done this song and dance a handful of times already,” she said. “I've gotten back with him after a cheating scandal, so I don't know if Tristan is under the impression, ‘Oh wow, OK, let's just ride this out and eventually she'll get back with me.’”\nShe added, “I get why he would think that, so it's my job to set boundaries that my actions show otherwise... it's always about the kids, and that's what it is. But we're not just hanging out by ourselves... I keep it very short and sweet and make sure he knows it's always about the kids because it's so easy to fall back. I can't let those old habits easily come into my life. It's just not what I want.”\nOn the Thursday, October 5, episode of The Kardashians, Khloé and Kim discussed the former's ongoing support of her ex and his younger brother Amari following the passing of his mother Andrea. In particular, why the two brothers are still living with her while Thompson's home is being renovated. \n“I definitely feel overwhelmed and I guess stressed at times, but I'm not the one going through most of the pain here,” Khloé said in a confessional.\nKim's perspective was complicated.\n“I know you guys are gonna hate me for this, and you're gonna hate us, and you're gonna think Khloé's whatever,” she said. “It's so crazy because he's such a good friend and he's such a good dad, but he just couldn’t get it together in that area of being a faithful boyfriend.”\nShe continued, “You want to obviously hate him for that. Yeah, of course, his actions and who he was are so f---ed up, I can't deny that, and we've had our talks about it and had our fights about it... but he’s also shown so many decent things and has been a really good person and friend.”\nShe also said the NBA player is supportive of her kids, too, who she shares with former husband Kanye West. Kim claims that Thompson has stepped into a fatherly role with them and defended her when her ex-husband was being publicly combative. \nLater on, Khloé got more specific about why she lets him stay.\n“I'm not naïve to fact that my ex-boyfriend is living in my house and that we're in really sensitive times,” she said. “Tristan is in the very fresh stages of grieving [his mom]...”I never want to be someone that anyone can accuse that I misled them when it comes to love. I think I'm so adamant about that because I've been on the receiving end of it and I just don’t think love is something you play with.\nShe went on, “Tristan has said before [that] I'm his person. I'm not saying I don’t believe him but I've heard this, and of course, it's angered me before because I'm like, ‘If I f---ing am, then why have you treated me like this and how many times?’ I love love, and I am a hopeless romantic, but that's not gonna change how I feel and what happened.”\nShe added, “We're gonna be in each other's lives for the rest of each other's lives because of our kids, so I'm not gonna fight that, and I'm gonna make sure it's as nice as possible for me.”\nIn another confessional, she called the multiple cheating scandals “traumatic,” but explained how important it is to her to co-parent their children together. She also sympathized with his loss, having lost her own father at a young age. During the episode, Thompson praised Khloé for her “pure and great” soul and she responded in kind.\n“You're a good person at your core, that’s why I was with you,” she said. “Everyone has done dumb s--- in their life, just not everyone does it on a public platform, which sucks ... all of us, we're always rooting for you, we always want the best for you. We believe in you as a person... and just remember, you're not your past.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Ciara and Russell Wilson's Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-08 16:21:00", "text": "It seems like Ciara and Russell Wilson have been together forever, but they actually met in 2015, and were married only a year after they first connected. Together, the musical artist and Broncos star share three children: their daughter Sienna Princess, their son Win Harrison Wilson, and Ciara's son Future Zahir Wilburn from her former relationship with the rapper Future, whom Wilson treats as his own. \nHere's their complete relationship timeline so far.\nThe couple met on March 26, 2015, while at a basketball game at the University of Wisconsin. BET reports that Wilson asked Ciara out for dinner, seeing if she could meet him after a business meeting, but she said it was too late. He changed his plans.\n“I completely forgot about the 10:30 [P.M.] dinner,” he said. “Next thing I knew, it was 12:00 [A.M.], 12:30 [A.M.], and I was sold on you.” \nOnly a month later, they made their first official appearance together at the White House, during an event for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie Abe. \nThings went well, and soon, they were walking the red carpet at the BET Awards. \nThe couple made headlines when Wilson shared that they had decided to remain celibate until marriage. \n“I told somebody that’s the girl I want to be with before I even met her,” he explained during an interview with San Diego's The Rock Church. “Before I met her, I was like, ‘I’m probably going to end up with Ciara.’”\nHe continued, “She was in the dressing room getting ready to go before she went on stage, and she was sitting there, and God spoke to me and said, ‘I need you to lead her.’ And I was like, ‘Really?’ And he was like, ‘No, I want you to lead her.’ So I told her, ‘What would you do if we took all of that extra stuff off the table and just did it Jesus's way?’”\nHe added, “I ain't going to lie to you all now. I need you all to pray for us. I know you've seen her on the screen. If there's a 10, she's a 15.” \nThe couple made an appearance at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards at UCLA, which Wilson was hosting.\nCiara told Cosmopolitan more about their celibacy decision, saying, “You get to hug and you get to have a nice good kiss, but you have to be careful not to go too far so you don't end up in the place you're trying to avoid being in. Strong, strong, strong, strong! Just the strongest resistance to temptation.”\nIn another interview that month with People, Ciara said, “I’m not gonna lie. I’m human, so it is not easy, especially when I look at him, and I think he is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen—that I’ve ever laid my eyes on, to be honest.”\nThey also attended the pre-GRAMMY Gala together and posed for this iconic photo.\nA year after meeting, Wilson proposed to Ciara while they were on a trip in the Seychelles with a 16-carat custom diamond ring, according to Us Weekly. \n“She said Yes!!! Since Day 1 I knew you were the one. No Greater feeling... #TrueLove @Ciara,” he posted on Instagram on March 11, confirming their engagement.\nThey were married a few months later on July 6 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England, surrounded by friends and family. She wore a Roberto Cavalli gown with custom embroidery, bell lace sleeves, and a laced-up bodice, while Wilson was in a Giorgio Armani suit, People reported at the time. Celebs at the event included Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. \n“We are The Wilsons!” Ciara wrote over a photo from the day.\nCiara told People, “Our wedding was like a fairytale... We loved the countryside. We looked at a venue in the U.S., but we also looked abroad, and England just seemed magical and perfect.”\nShe added, “This is the happiest I have ever been.”\nThat fall, the couple announced they were expecting. Ciara shared the news on her 31st birthday, writing on Instagram, “On this special Birthday I received an abundance of love from friends and family.. and I'm excited to Finally share one of the Greatest Gifts of All that God could give... 👶🏽🍼💃🏽☺️❤️”\nWearing a floor-length red velvet gown from Jovani Signature to the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in February 2017, Ciara's pregnancy was very visible, and she looked radiant.\nTheir daughter Sienna was born on April 29, 2017.\n“Dear Sienna Princess Wilson, No matter how big the wave, we will always be your calm in the storm. We Love You. Love, Mommy & Daddy,” Ciara wrote on Instagram.\nThey shared the first photos of Sienna months later.\nCiara told E! that since marriage and welcoming a new child, her home has “been full of so much life and love.”\n“He's been such an incredible father since day one,” she said of Wilson's parenting skills. “He's so loving and very patient. He also likes to have fun—he's very spontaneous and we just have a good time as a family... He inspires me, he's so driven and very ambitious, and he's always working hard whether he's on the field or off the field.”\nShe added, “He's always trying to make an impact in any way that he can. It's really inspiring to watch and to have a partner that has that kind of ambition. I'm also a very ambitious person, I'm very driven...it really just flows.”  \nTwo years after their wedding, the couple went on an official honeymoon in Botswana, Africa.\n“I could wake up like this every morning,” the singer wrote over a safari video.\nShortly after, the couple launched Why Not You productions to develop both scripted and unscripted TV and movie projects. \n“While we work in different fields in our day-to-day, we are excited to come together to collaborate and create stories that we hope will touch people’s lives,” they said in a joint statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “We are both storytellers at heart and we want to be able to share stories that uplift people and inspire others to create positive change. That’s ultimately what we want this company to represent.” \nWhile promoting her new album Beauty Marks on The View, Ciara shared more about her relationship. \n“When you allow yourself to be vulnerable, you become your strongest,” she said. “When I met the love of my life it was not only loving me, it was to love my son.”\nLater that month, she told Access Hollywood, “You know my husband’s pretty awesome and you know it’s been an incredible journey...Time goes by so fast and we’ve been having the time of our lives. We call it organized chaos because obviously with him doing football and me doing music, the worlds are both moving fast and kinda like in two different directions, but sometimes parallel at the same time.”   \nIn January 2020, Ciara announced she and Wilson were expecting again. \n“Number 3,” she captioned a shot of herself in a bathing suit featuring a baby bump.\nOn July 23, their son Win Harrison was born. \n“Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy & Daddy Love You!” Wilson wrote on Instagram.\nCiara also shared a video of herself with the new arrival.\nCiara honored her husband at the 2021 Met Gala by wearing his jersey number in Seahawks green on a gown by Dundas while wearing his Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XLVIII and carriying a football clutch covered in crystals\nThe couple released a children's book together titled Why Not You?, encouraging kids to dream big. It is an extension of their shared Why Not You Foundation.\nCiara told People that young Future loves football, and Wilson has been helping him train.\n“He's all about the details. He's all about the technique,” she said. “He's firm with love though...He's all about coming back with love and so it's beautiful.”\nCiara brought Future and Sienna to watch Wilson play for the Denver Broncos in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAt the end of a difficult season with the Broncos, Ciara wrote her husband a loving message of support on Instagram.\n“This season has been a roller coaster ride like no other… I've watched you endure so much and keep your head up high through it all! Your faith, belief, and confidence never wavered!” she wrote. “What I do know is a Winner is someone that gets back up when they're knocked down, someone who doesn't stop believing. Someone who embraces adversity and stays neutral through it all. Someone who can't be influenced by the words or opinions of others. Someone who loves loving others, serving others, and is always there for his family. All of that you are!” \nCiara announced she was pregnant with her and Wilson's third child together and her fourth overall. She wrote on Instagram, “‘You look at me like that again, we make another kid… You my heart I’m your rib’ ”\nA source told People that Ciara and Wilson were looking to keep expanding their family. “She loves being a mother so this is what she loves doing,” the source said. “This is what she has always wanted, and Russ too. They've always wanted a lot of kids.”\nCiara made an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast in October, and discussed her pregnancy and plans for the future with Wilson. First, she told host Alex Cooper about the early days of their courtship and keeping things private to start.\n“It was the best thing for the both of us, we felt,” she said. “Because even though we were meeting as friends and all that stuff, my son was there and my dad was there.”\nShe added, “We were, like, talking and talking and talking and it was crazy. Everything that we talked about, like, we were aligned on...I knew that I'd never felt what I felt in that moment.”\nCiara also talked about Wilson as a dad.\n“He's an amazing father,” she said. “Watching him with all of our kids—it is one of the sweetest things. It's one of the sexiest things, to be honest with you. I'm just saying, ladies, when a man jumps in and changes the diaper, and he's pulling up to teacher-parent conferences, it's like, ‘Ooh!’”\nShe added, “There's something about a man turning on that part of them, like, they're being a man for you but they're also being a man for your family. There's no better feeling than knowing that.”\nCooper joked about the pair planning baby number five, but Ciara quickly responded, “Don't get crazy now. Let's go one baby at a time.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "All About Taylor Lautner’s Wife Taylor Dome", "date": "2023-10-08 17:38:00", "text": "Twilight’s Taylor Lautner found his other half in another Taylor. Taylor Dome has officially changed her last name to “Lautner” since their marriage, but to help with some confusion, she’ll be referred here by her maiden name. It’s an issue they deal with themselves, as they’re happy to joke about. In fact, when Lautner appeared in a Taylor Swift music video, the three Taylors recreated the Spider-Man meme about finding your doppëlganger.\nThe Lautners are very open about their lives and marriage, and even have their own podcast together, The Squeeze. But here’s some info on Dome and how her and Lautner’s marriage came to be.\nDome is a registered nurse, completing her studies in 2019. She has also been working on her profile as an influencer, launching LEMONS by Tay in January 2022, a site dedicated to self-care and mental health. \nShe was also once a huge Twilight fan. She shared a hilarious throwback photo of herself in November 2020 wearing a Twilight sweatshirt with the hashtag “#tbt #twilightforever.”\nIn June 2022, she shared a video about who her childhood crush was, and it turns out Dome was once Team Edward.\nAnd yet, she ended up with Jacob Black. Lautner commented on the post, “Bout time I won something.” \nDome is a good friend of Makena Moore, Lautner’s sister, and she introduced them.\n“My sister Makena actually introduced us,” he said in an interview. “She called me and said, ‘Dude, I found your future wife. You need to meet this girl.’ And the rest is history.”\nWhile doing an interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2022, he told Clarkson, “It’s just me and my sister so we’re super close, and she always said that she was gonna introduce me to my future wife, and I was like, ‘Sure.’”\nAt the time of the intro, Lautner had taken a break from acting.\n“I wanted to take a step back and enjoy life and spend some time with my family and friends,” he told People. “And I met my fiancée out of it, so it all worked out.”\nThey connected during a game night, he explained. \n“I love game nights. She’s [Moore] like, ‘Throw a game night, invite me and some of my friends over, and I’ll bring Tay. She’ll just be one of them, and you guys can just meet,’” he said. “We hit it off, and the rest is history.”\nThey shared that they were dating in 2018, and Lautner proposed in November 2021. They were married on November 11, 2022 in at Epoch Estate Wines outside of Paso Robles, California. Lautner wore a Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo, and Dome wore a Winnie Couture A-line gown.\nLautner described his proposal to Access Hollywood, saying, “She always has said, ‘I don’t want anything special. I don’t want anything big and grand. Do it in the kitchen...I love cooking, so I make us food all the time in the kitchen and we just eat at the counter. And she’s like, ‘One night after we eat in the kitchen, that’s all I want. Simple.’”\nBut he couldn’t stop himself from doing a little more.\n“I got tons of flowers and candles and a sign. So when she came home at the end of the day, after a long day of work, she walked into that,” he said. “It was a lovely surprise.”\nHe added, “It actually did take her a little longer than expected to say ‘yes’ because she was weeping so hard. She couldn't even walk up to me. So I was on my mark and I have to leave the mark to go get her to lift her up from crying … It took a sec, but it was super sweet.”\nFor Dome’s 26th birthday, Lautner gave her a tattoo session. They got matching tattoos of their wedding date “11.11.22” on their left wrists.\nThey made their first red carpet appearance together in April 2022, at the CMT Awards.\nOn The Kelly Clarkson Show, Lautner shared his wife’s plans to officially change her last name joking, “Cause we already share one name, so it’s gonna be extra complicated,” adding, “I’m a narcissist.” \nOn Wednesday, October 4, the two Taylors attended the Inaugural Rare Impact Fund Benefit which was hosted by Selena Gomez. They wore chic color coordinated outfits in black, with Lautner donning a two piece velvet ensemble with satin details and short sleeves and a pair of matching black shoes. His wife was in a strapless black gown with a thigh-high split up the skirt. She had a black-and-white blazer hung over her shoulders. On her feet were a pair of nude high-heeled sandals.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Relationship", "date": "2023-10-08 17:53:00", "text": "One of Hollywood's most beloved couples, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, seem to have a perfectly-balanced relationship—particularly when they take turns lovingly roasting each other on social media. The pair began dating in 2011 and were married about a year later. That might seem fast, but they'd been friends for a while and could simply no longer deny the chemistry between them.\nMore than a decade later, Lively and Reynolds remain happily married and share three daughters—James, Inez, and Betty—and their fourth baby, whose name and gender haven't been shared yet. \nHere, the complete history of Lively and Reynolds' love story.\nLively and Reynolds met through work. The two starred in the superhero movie Green Lantern but didn't date at the time. They both were actually in other relationships. Lively was dating her Gossip Girl co-star Penn Badgley, while Reynolds was married to Scarlett Johansson, a future on-screen superhero herself. They did appear together for the first time during Comic-Con in San Diego in 2010, preceding the film's release.\nA few months later, Badgley and Lively split after three years together but supposedly remained friends. \nA source told Us Weekly, “They’re professionals. They're still good friends and hang out on the set.” \nThey did not publicize the news of their break up right away, however.\nAt the end of that same year, Reynolds and Johansson released a joint statement to People confirming they were separating, which read, “After long and careful consideration on both our parts, we’ve decided to end our marriage. We entered our relationship with love, and it’s with love and kindness we leave it. While privacy isn’t expected, it’s certainly appreciated.”\nReynolds filed for divorce a few weeks later in December.\nLively and Reynolds walked the red carpet premiere of Green Lantern in Hollywood on June 15, 2011. There were still no rumors of a romance, and Lively was actually romantically linked to Leonardo DiCaprio. Lively and DiCaprio were first photographed together in Cannes, France that May, and then spent the summer together. But it was a brief fling, and E! reported they ended things when the season changed. \nBut with fall came new love. People reported that Lively and Reynolds were dating shortly before Halloween, when she was seen exiting his apartment in Boston at the crack of dawn after his birthday weekend. A source told People at the time that the two are “very much a couple,” and “they’re really happy together.”\nBy Christmas time, Lively was already familiar with Reynolds' family, visiting his hometown of Vancouver in late December. Paparazzi caught a shot of them holding hands while walking in the streets between family time.\nIn the new year, PopSugar reported the pair went to New Orleans to Reynolds' private home for a romantic getaway.\nThe couple were back in Vancouver in the spring, PopSugar reported. They also ferried to Nanaimo, British Columbia, to meet with Reynolds' brother.\nOn September 9, 2012, Lively and Reynolds got married during a small secret ceremony with friends and family. The bride wore a couture gown designed by Marchesa, and Reynolds was in a classic Burberry suit. \n“When Ryan first saw her, his face broke into a huge smile that crinkled his eyes,” a source told People. “They just stared at each other with absolute love. Their faces were lit up with the candlelight, and it looked like something out of a romance movie.”\nThe couple have since apologized for holding their event at Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Boone Hall is a former plantation, and wedding on one is generally viewed as distasteful and offensive given the site's history.\nReynolds said in an August 2020 interview with Fast Company, “It’s something we’ll always be deeply and unreservedly sorry for. It’s impossible to reconcile. What we saw at the time was a wedding venue on Pinterest. What we saw after was a place built upon devastating tragedy. Years ago, we got married again at home—but shame works in weird ways. A giant f*cking mistake like that can either cause you to shut down or it can reframe things and move you into action. It doesn’t mean you won’t f*ck up again. But repatterning and challenging lifelong social conditioning is a job that doesn’t end.”\nIn 2019, the couple donated $2 million to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights. \nJust after their marriage, Lively told Allure, “Right now, I'm so peaceful. I've never been happier in my life,” she said. It was also her first mention of a family since her marriage.\n“I've always wanted a big family,” she told outlet, answering a question about how many kids she wants with, “Oh, I'd love 30 if I could.” \nThe pair went to Paris for a little PDA, according to some Daily Mail photographs.\nThe pair appeared on the red carpet together for the first time since getting married, attending The Sound of Change Live concert at Twickenham Stadium in London.\nFor Lucky magazine’s September cover, Lively opened up about how marriage was influencing her personal style. Not at all!\n“I was recently asked how my style has changed since I got married, as if I was living under some sort of dictatorship,” she claimed. “I should hope I dress differently at 25 than I did when I graduated high school. I hope I never stop changing.\"\nBut she admitted that Reynolds does influence her in some ways. \n“I'm very lucky to be with someone who has better taste than me. We influence each other in different ways. With film and TV, you don't see the results for months. Building a home, you get immediate gratification.” \nThe couple attended the A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To Cure Parkinson's event benefiting The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research in New York City. Reynolds lost his father to Parkinsons, so the event is close to his heart.\nLively and Reynolds attended their first Met Gala together on May 1, 2014, in New York City, wearing Gucci.\nLively told Vogue that summer that she and Reynolds live in one another's pockets.\n“Everything we do in life, we do together,” she said. “He’s going to be a great father and leader and patriarch—he’s so meant to be all of those things.” \nShe spoke about children again in the September issue of Marie Claire, saying, “He's my best, best friend. What do you do with your best friend? You do nothing. If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would.”\nOn her lifestyle website Preserve, Lively announced she was expecting her first child with Reynolds, sharing a maternity photo.\nLively gave birth to her eldest daughter James in December 2014, though they did not initially share James' name or gender.\nA source told Us Weekly in earlier January, “The baby came early but everyone is happy and healthy.”\nThe big name reveal came from Reynolds during an interview on the Today Show. \n“It's James. Everyone knows. I didn't want to be the first guy screaming it out to the media,” he said. “Because as we know, little girls turn into teenage girls and little teenage girls sometimes scan through the archives and go, ‘Why did you do that?’”\nA couple months later, Reynolds shared a photo of baby James' hand. He captioned it, “Thumb wrestling isn’t always fair. Curiously, my hand is the small one.”\nThe couple began to get more goofy on social media in the following years, and that Chirstmas, Reynolds shared a present from his wife on Instagram with the caption, “Mrs @blakelively had this made by AdoraWools. Nothing says ‘I love you’ like a felt #Deadpool, holding a chimichanga while riding a Unicorn dressed in ass-less leather chaps. Amaright fellas?” \nIn February 2016, Reynolds' massive hit Deadpool premiered, and the couple walked the red carpet event together, their first major appearance since having a kid.\nWhile at the amFar New York Gala a few days later, Reynolds Entertainment Weekly that his first date with Lively was actually a double date because they were just “buddies.”\nHe said, “About a year after Green Lantern had come and gone, and we were both single we went on a double date–she was on a date with another guy, and I was on a date with another girl and it was like the most awkward date for the respective parties because we were just like fireworks coming across.”\nLively and Reynolds looked stunning State Dinner at the White House in Washington, D.C.\nMoving towards Lively's joke goal of 30 children, Us Weekly reported the couple were expecting their second child in April 2016. Lively was filming The Shallows at the time, and photos from set show her small baby bump.\nLively told Marie Claire that she knew Reynolds “would always be my best friend for my whole life” in a July 2016 cover story.\nShe continued, “I'd never known anything like the friendship that I had with him. I could like him as much as I loved him.”\nWhen asked what she was protective of, she replied,“My family: That's the thing that I feel most protective of and the thing that I feel is the most exposed when I feel exploited. Ryan had a nice, normal upbringing, and we want our kids to have the same normal life that we had. We don't ever want to rob them of what we had, because we'd feel really selfish.”\nTheir second child is born that September, as Page Six reported at the time. Once again, they keep their second daughter's name under wraps until Us Weekly revealed it to be Inez several months later.\nDuring an interview for GQ’s December cover, Reynolds was asked when he knew Lively was the one.\n“Probably after the sex,” he joked. “No, we were hanging out at this little restaurant in Tribeca that's open really late, and this song came on, and I was just like, ‘Want to dance?’ No one was in there, so it was just totally empty. And it was just one of those moments where halfway through the dance, it was like, ‘Oh, I think I just crossed a line.’ And then I walked her home. And, uh, you know, I don't really need to go into what happened after that.”\nWhen asked if he remembered what the special song was, he answered, “I do, but I'm not gonna say. You're shut out.”\nThe two girls made their red carpet debut with their parents when Reynolds was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nOnce again, Reynolds and Lively attended the Met Gala looking fabulous in New York City.\nLively and Reynolds are busy parents and busy actors, but they balance their hectic schedule.\n“My husband and I don’t work at the same time, so we all go together as a family,” she told People. “If we’re away as a family, it’s never more than for a day. We stay together.” And the kids go on set.\nShe added, “I’m not in an office where I can’t do that, so she’s either with me or when I’m shooting a scene, she’s one room away. If she really needs me, I can pop over there.”\nReynolds celebrated Valentine’s Day by sharing a photo of a delicious cake he made, joking the icing was glue in the caption. It was for his wife, of course.\nNow on year seven together, rumors surfaced that the couple might not be getting along too well, but Reynolds cleared things up by tweeting, “I wish. I could use a little ‘me time.’”\nI wish. I could use a little “me time”. https://t.co/S6kXFsWaMe\nWhile promoting Lively's new movie A Simple Favor, Reynolds teased his wife for answers to the film's mysteries on Twitter, and she answered, “Oh darling, of all the secrets I’m keeping from you, this should be the LEAST of your concerns... trust me.”\nOh darling, of all the secrets I’m keeping from you, this should be the LEAST of your concerns... trust me.\nFor the red carpet premiere of Reynolds’ project Detective Pikachu, the pair also premiered their new pregnancy. Lively wore a stunning yellow gown that showed off her figure and their expectation of a third child.\nIn October 2019, Lively and Reynolds welcomed their third child, a daughter named Betty, though her name wasn't revealed for quite a while—until it appeared on their friend Taylor Swift's album folklore.\nTaylor Swift loves to drop Easter eggs in her projects, and her fans guessed that when they heard the names James and Inez, the third baby's name must be somewhere in the lyrics of folklore track “Betty.” Indeed, Betty is the title of the song about fictional characters named after all three of Reynolds and Lively's daughters at that point.\n“She said ‘James, get in, let's drive,’” Swift sings, and, “You heard the rumors from Inez / You can't believe a word she says.”\nCanadian-born Reynolds got his American citizenship shortly before the 2020 elections, and the couple voted early together. Lively shared a photo of herself with him, writing in the caption, “It was Ryan’s first time. He was understandably scared. It all happened so fast. Like, REALLY fast. He wept. I pretended to weep. Then he called all his friends.”\nReynolds tells Access Hollywood that he loves “being a girl dad.” \n“I try to be as present as possible. I shoot movies, and my wife shoots movies, and we go travel all over the place, and we just all go together,” he said. “I think that that’s been the best part of it. We really don’t spend a lot of time apart. I get to spend a lot of time with my girls.”\nHe added, “I come from all boys. I have three older brothers. So for me to have three daughters has been such a ride, and I love every second of it.”\nThe couple shared on Instagram that they were getting their COVID-19 vaccinations.\nReynolds wished his wife a happy Mother’s Day with a photo of them cuddled up together, writing in the caption that Lively was the “heart and soul of every moment their family shares.”\nReynolds shared more about how he made the first move on Lively while on SmartLess podcast. He recalled how when he and Lively met up in Boston, their friendship became something “out of a fairy tale.”\n“I met Blake on the darkest crease in the anus of the universe called Green Lantern,” he joked. “We were friends and buddies, and about a year and a half later, we went on a double date, but we were dating separate people.”\nHe and Lively had “always kind of kept in touch sort of casually.” \n“Next thing you know, she was going to Boston, I was going to Boston and I said, ‘Well, I'll ride with you.’ We got on the train and we rode together. I was just begging her to sleep with me,” he claimed. \nWhen asked what his big move was, he said, “I would use a little bit of tear stick so I could get the tears kind of rolling…then I would tell a little sob story about my life.” \nIn August, the couple walked the red carpet together for the premiere of Reynolds' video game movie Free Guy, with Lively wearing Prabal Gurung dress and Lorraine Schwartz jewels.\nLater that same month, Reynolds said in SiriusXM interview, per the Daily Mail, that thecouple trusted Taylor Swift “implicitly” with sharing youngest daughter's name.\n“We thought it was pretty damn amazing. We still do,” he said. “I still walk down the street and shake my head thinking, ‘I can't believe that happened.’” \nHe continued, “The names are the names of our kids. We trust [Taylor] implicitly. She's very sensitive to any of that stuff.”\nReynolds also explained that the song “has nothing to do with our kids other than our kids' names.”  \nThe couple were “surprised,” and they had “no idea” until they listened to the song the first time.\nReynolds shared more about how he and Lively keep their romance alive after a decade together in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. The secret ingredient is friendship.\n“We don’t take each other too seriously, but we're also friends,” he said. “Falling in love is great, but do you like each other? That's kinda the question you gotta ask yourself, you know, going into it. We've always liked each other. We grow together. We learn from each other. So yeah, I'm lucky to have a buddy in that.”\nSpeaking of friendships, the pair celebrated Taylor Swift's musical guest spot on Saturday Night Live that month. They were joined by Swift's ex Joe Jonas, his wife Sophie Turner, and Selena Gomez. The group attened the SNL afterparty at L'Avenue.\nThe next day, Swift dropped a teaser for new video for “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),” which was directed by Lively.\n“SURPRISE! NEW MUSIC VIDEO TOMORROW at 10am ET,” Swift announced on her Instagram. “I finally got to work with the brilliant, brave, & wickedly funny @blakelively on her directorial debut. Join us as we raise a toast, and a little hell.”\nAfter a busy year, Reynolds said he'd be taking a break from acting to be more available to his family in an interview with LinkedIn News Senior Editor at Large Jessi Hempel.\n“I want my kids to have a pretty normal schedule,” he explained. “For many years when my wife Blake would shoot a film, I would not shoot a film and I would be with the kids and vice versa. So we would sort of trade off. We never really worked at the same time. But always we were away. So the kids were away too.”\nHe continued, “Now that they're in school, they have a somewhat normal schedule. I think it's totally important for their development, and I really enjoy being a present dad. I love taking them to school in the morning; I love picking them up.”\nThe couple were seen out on a casual date in New York City on January 24, bundled up for a cozy day on the town.\nReynolds shared a picture of himself on the beach in matching blue pajamas, holding a white mug and smiling, which he credited to his wife on Instagram. It offered a little glimpse into their married life. \nAfter many years of being attendees, the couple were co-chairs of the Met Gala in 2022, where the theme of the night was “Gilded Glamour.” Lively wore a crown and a custom Atelier Versace dress, and Reynolds wore a black tuxedo. \nA video of Reynolds’ reacting to seeing Lively in her outfit for the first time went viral on @21MetGala’s Twitter, and it's pretty adorable.\nTo celebrate Lively's birthday on August 25, Reynolds posted a TikTok of him and Mariah Carey, writing, “My favorite thing that's ever happened on August 25th.” \nThe couple announced that they were expecting a fourth child when Lively stepped out for the Forbes Power Women's Summit, where she was being honored, and her pregnancy was very evident.\nTo get the paparazzi off her back, Lively shared her own pregnancy photos on Instagram as well.\n“Here are photos of me pregnant in real life so the 11 guys waiting outside my home for a 🦄 sighting will leave me alone,” she wrote. “You freak me and my kids out. Thanks to everyone else for all the love and respect and for continuing to unfollow accounts and publications who share photos of children. You have all the power against them. And thank you to the media who have a ‘No Kids Policy’. You all make all the difference 🙏♥️. Much love! Xxb.”\nFor the holiday, Reynolds released a new version of the classic tale A Christmas Carol with comedian Will Ferrell, a musical title Spirited. The actor shared one of his much-needed choreography lessons on Instagram, joking, “You’ve got to be willing to be bad at something if you want to be… slightly less bad at it? Here’s Will and I proving that point!” \nReynolds might not have thought much of his moves, but Lively was all over it.\n“Can you get pregnant while pregnant??” she asked in the comments section.\nReynolds took the time during his People's Choice Award speech to gush about his family, after giving a thanks to his “work family.”\n“I’ve got to thank my family family,” he said, via Buzzfeed. “Blake and my three daughters. It’s going to be a fourth child very soon. If it happens tonight, while I’m here, I will be looking for a couch to sleep on for a little while. I'd venture to guess that [People's Choice Award performer] Shania Twain has an amazing couch, I'm just saying.” \n“But Blake and my girls, you are quite literally my heart,” he continued. “You are my hope, you are my happiness. I joke that my family exhaust me, but in reality, you give me more strength than any man could possibly deserve.”\nIn December, Reynolds also posted a photo of meeting Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus. \n“We met Jessica Claus and her husband on the Polar Express. She was everything I’d always dreamed since I was a kid. She smelled like cinnamon buns and sangria. 🎄,” he captioned it. \nOn January 2, Lively shared another pregnancy pic for her fans.\nHer other big news for the month was that she'd been cast as red-headed Lily in the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's mega hit It Ends With Us. After Deadline reported her casting, Lively posted an Instagram Story of herself with red hair, set to Smashing Pumpkin's song “Lily (My One and Only).” \nBaby #4 arrived...although the child's name, gender, and birth date were kept private. Lively subtly revealed during Super Bowl Sunday that she had given birth to their newest addition when she shared a photo of herself visibly not pregnant.\nReynolds discussed how he and Lively were doing in mid-February, declining to share the child's gender during an interview with CNBC’s Power Lunch. “We’re very excited,” Reynolds said. “Look, we wouldn’t do this four times if we didn’t love it. Everybody’s doing great. Everybody’s actually doing fantastic. If we hadn’t figured it out by now, I think we’d be in deep, deep trouble.”\nPresenting the 2022 CNBC Stock Draft Champions:@VancityReynolds and @weareMNTN's Mark Douglas They join to talk why they chose Netflix and Ford in the draft, recap the ads and marketing landscape after The Super Bowl, and other business ventures they're involved in pic.twitter.com/p9keg7Jwc5\nLively shared a look at her husband's summer physique—and made headlines for the “extra spicy” commentary she added to the photo. It marked a rare moment of public flirting for the pair.\nReynolds marked Lively’s 36th birthday on August 25 with a very romantic tribute full of never-before-seen pics of the couple. “The only thing irrevocably mine in the world is the love and appreciation and awe I feel for this person,” he wrote. “Witnessing her life is something I couldn’t take for granted if I tried. And believe me, I try. Happy Birthday, @blakelively. You hung the damn moon.”\nOn Sunday, October 1, the couple joined friend Taylor Swift in New Jersey for the New York Jets game. Swift's rumored love interested Travis Kelce was playing against the Jets with the Kansas City Chiefs, and she filled out the VIP box with other celebrities. In addition to Lively and Reynolds, she was joined by Hugh Jackman, Sophie Turner, Sabrina Carpenter, and Brittany Mahomes.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick's Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-08 18:29:00", "text": "Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick have one of the longest marriages in Hollywood, but they have managed to keep much of their private life private outside of a few strategic announcements. This is especially surprising considering how huge Parker got as the iconic Carrie Bradshaw on HBO's Sex and the City.\nThe couple seem to really understand one another, and that likely comes from the fact they understand their shared industry very well, too. They started dating in the early nineties, married in the late nineties, and went on to have three children together. \nHere's a timeline of the couple's 30-plus year relationship.\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick met after being introduced to Parker by her brothers, Pippin and Toby, who founded the Naked Angels Theater Company. Both Parker and Broderick were already in the business, and the actor directed a play at the siblings' theater. They were then introduced.   \nAfter five years of dating, the couple finally performed together side-by-side. Their debut was on Broadway in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Parker told the Los Angeles Times, “He's probably the funniest fellow I've met in my whole life...He's so bright, so handsome, I think he's the most handsome man I've seen in my life. And he inspires me. I'm mad for him, totally.”\nShe also shared how they got together the first time.\n“He left a very charming, very self-effacing message on the machine,” Parker told the New York Times that same year. “You know, ‘Hi, it's Matthew Broderick.’ You had to use your last name.”\nOn May 19, 1997, the couple tied the knot at New York City's Angel Orensanz Synagogue. They did not prep anyone for a wedding, inviting 100 friends to a party that then turned into a surprise ceremony. \nOn October 28, 2002, the couple welcomed their first child, a baby boy named James Wilkie, after the actor's late grandfather, James Broderick. \nBroderick joins Parker at the premiere of the Sex and the City movie.\nOn June 22, 2009, they welcomed twin girls via surrogate, named Marion and Tabitha. In an interview with Vogue, Parker said the couple “tried and tried and tried to get pregnant” in the conventional way, but it did not work out. \n“I would give birth as often as I could, if I could,” she said. “I cherished all the milestones, the good and the bad.”\nAfter about twenty years together, Parker admitted that things between them weren't always smooth sailing in an interview with The Telegraph.\n“We've been together for 20 years and you have good days, you have decent days, and you have bad days. That's a marriage,” she said. “That's a relationship. That's a friendship, even—relationships outside the marriage run the same course.”\nParker added, “If you're in it for the long haul, and you want meaningful relationships, you are going to go through lots of different periods.”\nBecause of her work as the star of the majorly popular Sex and the City, Parker is generally the one getting interviewed, and Broderick tends to keep a low profile. But while on the Meredith Vieira Show, he talked about why things have worked out for them long-term.\n“We really are friends beyond everything else, and we talk a lot,” he said. “Keep talking, I guess, I know how cliché that is. Too much silence is definitely not a good idea.” \nFor their 20th anniversary, Parker shared a sweet wedding photo on Instagram with the caption, “It flew by Baby. Good golly I love you. XXX, Your wife.”\nParker appeared on an episode of Sophia Amoruso's podcast, Girlboss Radio,  and said she and Broderick often end up being apart for work.\n“I know this sounds nuts, but we have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,” she said. “His work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that's been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share in a way.”\nThe couple finally returned to the stage together again for a Broadway show called Plaza Suite that made it to the pre-run before being shut down by the pandemic. In March 2020, they told WSJ. Magazine that there's a reason they waited so long to bring the band back together.\n“We very rarely both work at the same time,” Broderick explained.\n“This is the first time since we've had three children that we … are even prepared,” Parker added. “And it's hard. We have a son who's about to be away for spring semester. But I say all the time, there are families with parents serving in the military who are away all the time, you know? Just endless, impossible situations.” \nWhile on the SiriusXM show Quarantined with Bruce, Broderick shared another little “secret” to marriage: There is none.\n“I don't know the secret at all, but I'm very grateful, and I love her. It's amazing,” he said.\n“You know, speaking of how talented my wife is, I should also say that getting to do this play, even though we only just did it in Boston for a little while ... she was so, so good in it,” he said. “And I had never acted with her onstage and had never really acted with her at all. And I was just reminded of how funny and smart and what a great comic actor she is—or actor, never mind the comic part.”\nHe added, “She's very good at it. So I hope everybody gets to see her do it.” \nParker is supported by her husband and son at the premiere of And Just Like That...\nParker appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen  and shared that her first kiss with Broderick “was outside an apartment building,” and the second while heading to the subway station.\n“I had a Ricola in my mouth. It was the dead of winter and I thought—well, it just seemed like a third party. So I spit it out into my gloved hand because I was getting on the subway … It was stuck on my glove,” she said.\nAnd it did ruin the glove. \nBroderick took his turn on WWHL with Andy Cohen, and was asked when he knew he wanted to be with Parker forever.\n“Oh, the first time I met her,” he said. “I saw her walking down the street and thought, ‘That's it.’” \nFor their 25th marriage anniversary on May 19, Parker shared an intimate pic with Broderick on Instagram.\nThe couple appeared together at the Hocus Pocus 2 premiere, in which Parker plays evil witch Sarah Sanderson, along with their daughters Tabitha Hodge and Marion Loretta Elwell.\nOn Saturday, May 20, Parker shared a photo of a champagne cork that came out of the celebratory bottle she shared with Broderick for their 26th anniversary. \n“Happy 26th anniversary, my husband,” she wrote in the caption. “That sure was a nice celebration and a real nice bottle of champagne. And a gorgeous walk home.”\nShe added, “Oh the miles we have strolled together. I love you. XOX, your SJ.”\nOn Thursday, October 5, Parker and Broderick walked the red carpet at the New York City Ballet Fall Fashion Gala. In a sweet moment captured by People, Parker stops to check and adjust her husband's bowtie. She was also wearing a long black bow accessory in her hair, which she briefly held up for a comparison to his before they both turned back to pose for photos arm-in-arm.\nParker was wearing a gown by Carolina Herrera with an off-the-shoulder neckline, peekaboo keyhole cutouts down the bodice, and a tulle skirt, along with different color heels in black and nude shades featuring rhinestone studded buckles. She also carried a small silver bucket purse and had a simple black watch on one wrist. Her husband wore a classic suit and glasses. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "All About Dalton Gomez, Ariana Grande’s Ex-Husband and Partner of 3.5+ Years", "date": "2023-10-08 19:26:00", "text": "The former couple officially filed for divorce on September 18, 2o23.\nOn May 15, 2021, Ariana Grande secretly made one of the biggest moves of her life: She married her fiancé and partner of over a year, Los Angeles real estate agent Dalton Gomez. The pair got engaged just ahead of the Christmas holiday, less than a year after the two were first seen together in February. On May 26, Grande shared the first photos from their wedding, taken by Stefan Kohli. The shots gave the public a rare and intimate look at the two together. \nGomez and Grande had publicly been together for over a year and privately longer. But they always kept their relationship out of the limelight, from the very beginning. \nTMZ reported in late March 2020 that the man Ariana Grande was seen making out with around Valentine’s Day was actually Gomez, and he had been her new boyfriend for “several months,” according to the outlet’s Grande sources. People and E! independently reported the same news hours later: that Grande is off the market but has been keeping her new relationship private.\nGrande and Gomez quarantined together, and he appeared on her Instagram Story, TMZ pointed out.\nThe singer confirmed their relationship in her “Stuck With U” music video on May 8, 2020. On May 26, 2020, Grande gave Gomez his first proper Instagram shoutout.\nGomez made his Instagram private right as news broke of their dating, but Grande did follow him. Amid news in July 2023 of their separation, Gomez's Instagram appears to have been disabled or deleted. Gomez and Grande ultimately filed for divorce in September 2023.\nSo who is Gomez? Here, all you need to know about him and his relationship with Grande, including info about their private wedding and what led the couple to privately separate in January 2023.\nAccording to his bio on the site, Gomez was raised in southern California and has been working in the luxury real estate market for five years.

A rep for Grande confirmed the wedding on May 17, detailing that the two wed in a private ceremony in her Montecito home over the weekend.\nAs for why the venue was chosen, a source told People, “Both Ari and Dalton love Montecito. They spend a lot of time there. It seems only natural that they would get married at Ari's beautiful and historic house.”\nAn insider describes the gathering to E! as “tiny and intimate. There was a lot of love and everyone is really happy.” TMZ was told by sources that there were less than 20 guests, and the nuptials were informal. There was no real “ceremony,” per the outlet, just a casual vow exchange. Neither Grande nor Gomez have posted about the news immediately after it broke.\nE! was told that “hundreds of white florals” were used as decor. “It was beautiful but not over the top,” a source said. “Ari wanted it to be simplistic and tasteful. All they cared about was having family there and to be able to enjoy the special moment together.” \nOn May 26, Grande shared photos from their wedding, taken by Stefan Kohli, in three Instagram posts. She confirmed their wedding date was May 15. She wore a Vera Wang dress for her nuptials. \nGrande broke the news of their engagement on December 20, sharing rare photos of them together and showing off the diamond and pearl ring that Gomez gave her. “forever n then some,” Grande wrote. The engagement comes 10 months after the couple were first seen in public together in February 2020.\nPeople reported that Gomez gave Grande a platinum, diamond wedding band he helped design. Solow & Co designed the band, and a spokesperson for Solow & Co told People that “they worked with Dalton on this. It's a beautiful, tasteful platinum and diamond pave band. Dalton was very happy with it.”\nGrande didn't keep the couple's honeymoon destination a complete secret. On July 11, she shared a gallery of honeymoon photos featuring her and Gomez in Amsterdam.\nGrande and Gomez kissed in a photo she shared of them on her Instagram two days after Valentine's Day.

Gomez appears in the second slide:\nOn November 29, 2022, Grande shared a gallery of images including rare snaps of her husband. It was captionless, but within its first five hours up, had already garnered 3.4 million likes.\nFor Valentine's Day 2023, Grande gave another rare look at her and Gomez's relationship in a tribute to him.\nGrande, who had kept a relatively low profile on social media while shooting Wicked, posted two Instagram Stories to celebrate her husband on Valentine's Day 2023. She reposted his tribute to her from his private Instagram (“my forever Valentine,” he wrote) and added her own post of just him, tagging him.\n\nGrande and Gomez have kept most details about their relationship out of the press. But after their May 2021 wedding, sources spoke to Entertainment Tonight and People about what the two's relationship is like.\n“Ariana's brother Frankie and her mom are so happy for her. They think Dalton really balances Ariana out and allows her to be her true self,” Entertainment Tonight's source said. “Ariana appreciates that Dalton accepts her and loves her for who she is. He's a little nerdy and hardworking and she loves that about him. He's also very protective over her and goes above and beyond to make her happy.”\nTwo sources spoke to People after the wedding.\nA friend told the outlet that “they're a great fit together. Dalton's entirely unfazed by the scope of her celebrity and is very grounding for her. He's young but mature and knows what he wants out of life.”\nA second source said that “he is very hardworking and focused. He is low-key and doesn't like attention. He isn't impressed by celebrities. He is perfect for her. Their life together is pretty special.”\nGomez appeared on Grande’s social media, hanging on her couch and petting her dog. TMZ’s sources told the outlet that the two were “seeing each other for several months now.”\nPeople’s source confirmed that Grande “has been with the same group of people for days” on March 25. “One of the people she is with right now is Dalton—they have been hanging out for a couple of months. Ariana doesn’t want to do another public relationship so she is trying to keep this one quiet, but she seems very happy with Dalton.”\nAnother source updated Entertainment Tonight on the couple’s quarantine at the end of May 2020. The insider said Grande is “in a really good place” but is in no rush to share her private life with him on social media.  “Ariana has had some hesitation being so public about her relationship with Dalton as she’s seen how that has worn on her past relationships [like with Pete Davidson and Mac Miller],” the source told ET, adding, “Dalton and Ariana are in Los Angeles together during quarantine, and it has been a great opportunity for them to spend quality time together.”\nWhile Grande hasn’t shared extensive details about her relationship on social media, she offered a little glimpse of it during her and Gomez’s birthdays. In late June, Grande went ’gram official with Gomez in honor of her 27th birthday. She posted a series of photos, one of which was a cuddled-up selfie of the couple. “almost 27 :)” she captioned the post.\nAfter celebrating her 27th birthday with a Midsommar-themed birthday affair, Grande shared a few more snaps of herself and Gomez kissing. \nFor Gomez’s 25th birthday in 2020, Grande gave the biggest glimpse into their relationship yet on Instagram. She shared several photos and videos of the pair, writing, “hbd to my baby my best friend my fav part of all the days :) i love u.” He wasn’t tagged in the post, but she also hasn’t disabled the comments—a difference from her last post featuring Gomez. \nFor Gomez’s 26th birthday in 2021, Grande posted a tribute with what looks like a photo from their Amsterdam honeymoon:\n“happy birthday to my baby my husband my best friend,” she wrote on her Instagram Story post. “i love you infinitely.”\nShe also shared this black-and-white image from their wedding:\nGrande confirmed her and Gomez’s relationship during the final minute of “Stuck With U.” The two appear dancing and showing PDA together. This is Grande’s first public acknowledgement of their relationship.\nGrande featured a clear shot and footage of Gomez on her Instagram Story on May 26. Gomez had helped her with her and Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Weather Girls short. She captioned a shot of him creating “rain” for the video with emojis. It was one of the first unobscured shots she’s shared of him. Gomez was hooded in her “Stuck With U” music video, which was the first glimpse she gave the public of their relationship.\nIn February, footage came out of Grande making out with Gomez at Bar Louie in Northridge, California. She arrived with him and her friends at 1 a.m. and stayed for about 30 minutes. Grande just had water there, TMZ reported at the time, while her friends drank. The guy she kissed “wasn’t instantly recognizable.” \nwait i hope the rumors about ariana dating dalton gomez are true.....i mean look at him🥺 pic.twitter.com/5xvcZPHpiN\nSince she seems to be ready to reveal this, here is part of my old thread: Ariana is dating Dalton Gomez, a real estate agent. pic.twitter.com/x8VXiifhMF\nFinally, last night Ariana posted several stories on instagram where Dalton is clearly seen. In the one he pets Toulouse, you can get a glimpse of an offering bowl he has, as posted by his brother Dakota. pic.twitter.com/DHdqupUyyA\nGrande was last linked romantically to Social House’s Mikey Foster.

She’s gotten to know him quickly with the quarantine. They’ve been spending a lot of one on one time at home.” \nGrande hasn’t posted on social media about Gomez. She explained why days after news broke that they’re dating. Grande wrote on a since-deleted Instagram Story that the internet’s criticism of her personal life led her to choose to share less of it on social media.\nGrande shared the video Florence Pugh posted defending her boyfriend Zach Braff after he was bullied by fans on Pugh’s IG because of his 21-year age gap with Pugh . “I am 24 years old,” Pugh told those fans in her video. “I do not need you to tell me who I should and should not love. And I would never in my life ever, ever tell anyone who they can and cannot love. It is not your place. And really, it has nothing to do with you. So if those rules are something that you do not like, then please unfollow me because the abuse that you throw at him is abuse that you’re throwing at me.”\nGrande praised Pugh for her statement and wrote that it resonated deeply with her because of her own experience sharing her life online. “Sharing special, personal life things that make u happy on the internet can be truly traumatic,” Grande said. “I know I’ve taken a step back from doing so to protect my loved ones and myself but I just wanted to share this and let u know how perfectly u expressed this and how appreciated u are for doing so @florencepugh.” \nSleuth fans noticed Grande follows both Gomez and his tattoo artist brother Dakota. One pointed out that Gomez and Aaron Kirman had the listing for the property she purchased. He also commented “This gurl cute” on her Instagram Live in March, the fan pointed out, to which Grande responded “I feel blessed.”\nNow to the more solid proof. Ariana has gone live on instagram yesterday, and one particular comment made her say “I feel blessed.” This comment is by Dalton, and her response is in a little delay, like responses usually are in a live stream on instagram. pic.twitter.com/WG08R9xokq\nA source confirmed this account to Us Weekly. “Ariana was looking for a home outside of Los Angeles to be her getaway house, and her team found Dalton to help,” the insider explained. “When she saw him, she immediately thought he was cute and very good-looking, and she asked her team to set up an in-person meeting with him. Ariana fell very hard for Dalton shortly after they met.” \nThe fact that Grande and Gomez are keeping their dating low-key isn’t the only difference between him and her exes. A source told Us Weekly in late August that Gomez really takes care of her. Grande’s previous boyfriends never “met her needs in the same way Dalton does. Her exes acted as though she was demanding and had crazy standards,” the source said.\nThat source added that Gomez “is the type of guy she has been looking for. He’s very protective of her, will go out of his way for her and does little things that are chivalrous. Dalton will go above and beyond to meet her needs.”\nGiven that things have really escalated. Us’s source said that “their relationship is serious. They’ve fallen madly in love with each other.”\nA few days after this update on their relationship, Gomez attended the MTV VMAs by Grande’s side. She posted a photo of the pair holding hands on Instagram, sneakily placing it as the last pic in the post. Us’s update came just three months before the two announced their engagement.\nEntertainment Tonight got an update from a source about how Grande and Gomez were settling into life as newlyweds—and how marriage changed how they feel about sharing their relationship publicly.\n“Ariana and Dalton felt like before they were married they couldn't be as open about their relationship without it being scrutinized in the media and now they feel way more at ease,” the outlet's source said. “They have plans to travel more together and feel closer than ever.”\nGrande and Gomez enjoy their new life as a married couple, the source added: “Ariana is happy and feels very relaxed. She feels like she is entering a new chapter of life and is excited to see where it goes.”\nThe couple really likes “making unified decisions,” the source said. “Ariana is Dalton's first priority in everything that they do and he really values her and shows it. Ariana loves that Dalton is super chill and how understanding he is of her.” \nDays after Entertainment Tonight reported that Grande and Gomez were more comfortable sharing their relationship publicly, Grande did just that on her birthday. The singer posted a video of the two kissing on her Instagram Story. She captioned it, “a bday baby. deeply thankful for so much love.”\nAriana Grande Via Instagram Stories pic.twitter.com/NxZ24yr6JO\nOctober 30 marked a new era in Grande’s music, and several songs on her sixth studio album seem to be about Gomez. In her first song, “Positions,” Grande sings about wanting to “meet your mama on a Sunday” and “make a lotta love on Monday” in reference to her current relationship.\nOther “Positions” lyrics nod to her new romance, including “Perfect, perfect / You're too good to be true (You're too good to be true)” and “Heaven sent you to me / I'm just hopin’ I don’t repeat history” as she did with ex-fiancé Pete Davidson. However, Grande doesn’t name Gomez outright as she did with her past loves in the track, “thank u, next.”\nThere are other nods to Gomez throughout the record. The explicit “34+35” lyrics paint a picture of the couple’s sex life. It also talks about her desire to have a family with Gomez. “You might think I’m crazy / The way I’ve been cravin’ / If I put it quite plainly / Just give me them babies,” she sings, later belting, “who’s counting the time when we got it for life?”\n“Safety Net” is about Grande falling for Gomez after being hurt by past relationships. In that track, she sings, “You’re making me forget my past / Never thought I’d feel like that / I came to peace with my past / Now you got me off track.” \nThe song “POV” also cements just how serious Grande and Gomez are. “I wanna love me / The way that you love me,” she sings. “For all of my pretty / And all of my ugly too / I’d love to see me from your point of view.”\nOn Christmas Day 2020, Grande posted a photo of her and Gomez cuddling near the Christmas tree as the first photo in a holiday gallery.“\"merry :)” she wrote. \nShe also included photos of her and Gomez spending the day with her brother Frankie, Frankie’s boyfriend, and her mom Joan. \nIn a sign things between Grande and Gomez are still going strong a year into dating, the private couple made a rare appearance in Los Angeles. On March 6, Grande and Gomez enjoyed a romantic dinner at the FIA restaurant in Santa Monica. Paparazzi photographed the two lovebirds wearing matching masks as they left the restaurant. Grande also wore her massive one-of-kind engagement ring, of course. The date was one of the first public sightings of Grande and Gomez together since Gomez proposed.\nIn a rare public show of affection, Grande posted a few photos of her and Gomez getting cozy.\nLove a just-because romantic moment. \nGrande and Gomez leaned into their first Halloween as a married couple with two different looks. They did an elaborate Miss Creature From the Black Lagoon look, with Grande as the swamp monster and Gomez as a handsome scuba man. They then debuted a more causal (for celeb standards) second couple costume: Audrey and Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors. A PDA shot capped off the gallery of that second look:\nGrande had family and contestants from Season 21 of The Voice over for Thanksgiving, and shared a series of photos and videos from the night of celebration.\nAmongst them was a cute picture of Grande sitting next to Gomez and hugging their dog Toulouse, hiding her face so only her signature ponytail and ribbon were visible.\nAriana Grande has been incredibly busy with the filming schedule for Wicked, in which she plays Glinda. A source told ET that Gomez has been backing her up during this demanding time.\n“Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez have both been keeping busy with work projects,” the source claimed. “Ariana has been so focused, but Dalton has been there with her and supporting her behind the scenes... He is happy for her and they are very in love.”\nA second source added, “This role is Ariana's dream and she's throwing herself fully into it and Dalton is supportive.”\nGrande revealed just how long she and Gomez had been dating in May 2023 when she posted a photo of them kissing on their wedding day to mark their two-year anniversary. “2 [years married], 3.5 years together!!!! I love him so,” she wrote. It served as a remarkably rare look into their relationship:\nOn Sunday, July 15, Grande was seen at Wimbledon without Gomez, watching the men's singles final between Djokovic and Alcaraz. Fans noticed that there was no ring on her wedding ring finger, despite it being a high profile event. She had been seen on social media without it as well, so this added fuel to rumors that they might be going through a rough patch.\nGrande was seated between Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield and Bridgerton star Jonathan Bailey. \nGrande has been in the UK filming Wicked Part 1 for some time now, and Gomez has deleted his Instagram. \nGrande’s lawyer Laura Wasser was the first to file for divorce on Monday, September 18, citing “irreconcilable differences” as their reason for splitting. Gomez filed after. Their date of separation was listed as February 20, 2023.\nSources explained to TMZ that Grande and Gomez worked everything out before they filed. Grande will “cut Dalton a check, and that will be that,” the outlet wrote.\nA source revealed to TMZ that there are no hard feelings between them, and their delay in filing was just because the former couple was sorting out everything and settling in private.\nGrande sparked speculation that she and Gomez may have broken up when she attended Wimbledon on July 16, 2o23, not wearing her wedding band. A day later, TMZ confirmed that Grande and Gomez had privately separated in January, per multiple sources connected to the couple. Their issues predated Grande going abroad to the U.K. to shoot Wicked in December. The outlet reported that privately, Grande and Gomez tried to reconcile a few months ago, but the effort failed.\nGrande and Gomez are still on good terms though, with the outlet describing them “friends [who] still talk on the phone regularly.” Their romance has ended though, and one source characterized them as “heading for divorce.”\nGrande did not immediately comment on the report.\nIn the first day after TMZ broke the news of Grande and Gomez's split, more outlets received details on the private effort they made the reconcile. TMZ reported that Gomez and Grande lived separate lives starting in January; they tried reconciling briefly in May but after two weeks, called it. Entertainment Tonight received more intel from a source on that last-ditch effort. “Dalton went to Europe recently to be with Ariana and try to work things out between them,” the source said. “But it just wasn’t working. They were having issues for a while, but they are trying to be as respectful as they can and protect each other's privacy through this breakup.”\nSources told TMZ that Gomez has already begun dating again with Grande's blessing since they separated. The outlet reported that Gomez struggled with Grande's fame once COVID-19 restrictions lifted.\nA source also noted to People that distance was a factor as Gomez's work keeps him in Los Angeles. “She was happy in Los Angeles for a couple of years. She wanted to make a life there with Dalton,” the source started.\n“He is super focused on his career and needs to live in Los Angeles,” the source continued. “It's definitely been an issue for them. Dalton's career is demanding and he can't leave Los Angeles often. So when [Grande] started filming Wicked in England, they were in for a long-distance marriage.”\nOn August 25, Gomez was photographed out in public for the first time since his breakup from Grande was announced. He appeared downcast in photos and was no longer wearing his wedding ring. A source spoke to Us Weekly on August 28 and confirmed that Gomez was still having trouble with the split.\n“It’s been a little while since Ariana and Dalton split, but he’s been adjusting to his new normal and learning to accept it for what it is,” the source said. “It’s certainly not how he expected things to play out because he obviously assumed they would be together forever.”\n“He never imagined he would be going through a divorce in the public eye,” the source added. “But he’s hanging in there and is grateful for his friends and family who have been really supportive.”\nOn September 13, a source told Entertainment Tonight that Gomez is still healing from the end of his and Grande’s marriage. “[He’s] throwing himself into work and working harder than ever since his split from Ariana,” the source said. “He is trying to stay distracted and keep himself busy in positive ways.”\nAs for his love life, Gomez “is dating a little bit and a lot of girls are giving Dalton attention. He is not completely over his relationship with Ariana, but he is doing his best to move forward.”\nThe update came a day after a source claimed to Daily Mail that Grande hadn’t completely let Gomez go. “It seems as if Ariana is holding onto Dalton in case things with Ethan don’t work. It is just so strange that she is living with Ethan and has not filed documents to end it with Dalton,” the source alleged. Of course, neither Grande, Gomez, nor Slater have commented on any of this.\nJust a few weeks after filing for divorce, the former couple came to an agreement on the end of their marriage. TMZ reports they had a prenup and there will be no spousal support. However, Gomez is reportedly receiving $1,250,000, tax-free, and half of the net proceeds from the sale of their home in Los Angeles. Grande will be asked to pay up to $25,000 of her ex-husband's attorney fees and for his continued 24-hour security. \nA source told Page Six, “Ariana and Dalton really wanted to take care of each through all of this and make it as easy on one another as possible—which is why they really took their time with everything.”\nThe insider added, “They have a strong mutual respect for eachother.” \nAnother source told TMZ, “There is still a strong mutual love and respect between Ariana and Dalton and they wanted to make sure everything was done right in lockstep with one another.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "All the Celebrity Breakups in 2023 (So Far)", "date": "2023-10-08 19:43:00", "text": "Love comes and goes, but the going tends to be much more dramatic. It's only spring, but the year 2023 has seen the end of several high-profile celebrity relationships, and there will likely be more to come. It's not a wish; it's just a fact.\nCheck below to see if any of your favorites have said goodbye to one another this year.\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's six-year romance was kept mostly private by the couple, although Alwyn inspired many of Swift's love songs over the years. News of their secret breakup, which took place in March and was initiated by Swift, broke on April 8. A source told People days later that although they had talked about marriage just months before, greater incompatibilities made it clear to the pair that they weren't right for the long, long term. “Joe has struggled with Taylor's level of fame and the attention from the public,” the source said. “The differences in their personalities have also become harder to ignore after years together. They've grown apart.”\n“Taylor didn't see them working out in the long run,” the source added.\nSoon after her break up with Alwyn, Taylor Swift was romantically connected to The 1975 frontman Matt Healy. The two had been linked for a brief time in 2014, but never confirmed anything. It seemed like they were very hot and heavy for a month or two, but sources said they split in June for good.\nElle Fanning, 24, and Max Minghella, 37, were first linked in July 2018 when they were seen holding hands in Florence, Italy, according to Us Weekly. The pair worked together on Teen Spirit, which Fanning starred in and Minghella wrote and directed that same year. The project is where their love story started. (Read more about their history here.)\nThroughout their run as a couple, both members opted to keep intimate details to themselves, although they would sometimes go to events together or post Instagrams showing moments from their life together.\nFanning announced the pair's breakup indirectly during her interview with Harper's Bazaar UK, published at the beginning of April. She revealed she was currently single but hopeful about finding love again. “I’m a hopeless romantic. I believe in love at first sight,” she said. “Call me crazy, but I believe in those things. I feel that it’s my destiny.”\nCaptain Marvel star Brie Larson and Elijah Allan-Blitz, a 36-year-old virtual reality director, were first photographed kissing in July 2019. The couple didn't talk about their relationship much while dating, but they did attend events together, such as the 2020 Oscars, The Daily Front Row's 2022 fashion awards in Los Angeles, and the D23 Expo in September 2022. The pair worked together on The Messy Truth VR Experience series, which earned them an Emmy in the ceremony's outstanding original interactive program category, per People.\nLarson and Allan-Blitz were last photographed together showing affection in September 2022, as seen above. \nLarson revealed that they privately broke up sometime after during a Harper's Bazaar interview published in late March 2023. She didn't specify when exactly the split occurred. She only said she's open to what's next in her life: “I don’t have a next job. I don’t have a home. I don’t have a partner. I don’t have a plan. I’m just completely open.”\nNoel Gallagher and Sara MacDonald met in the year 2000 while in Ibiza, and they got married in 2011. After 12 years of wedded life, they announced on January 16, 2023, that they were getting a divorce. \n“Noel and Sara will together continue to look after their children who remain their priority,” a spokesperson said. “Noel and Sara ask the media to respect their privacy and that of our family at this time.”\nThe former couple share two sons, Donovan, 15, and Sonny, 12. Gallagher has a daughter, Anaïs, 22, who he had in his former marriage to Meg Mathews, who he divorced in 2001.\nAfter five years together, Maisie Williams and Reuben Selby broke up. Williams shared the news with her followers on February 23, posting a selfie with Selby on her Instagram Stories. \nOver the pic, she wrote, “The end of an era. @reubenselby_ and I decided to end our relationship. Since we met 5 years ago, our connection always extended deeply into our shared, and separate, creative careers... and it will continue to do so.\"\nShe continued, “This decision is something we are so grateful or as we can protect the magic, that we can't help but emit, whenever we put our brains together. P.s no further questions, please, we must protect our children (my dog).”\nSelby reshared the announcement in his own Stories, adding a heart emoji.\nAvril Lavigne and Mod Sun started dating in January 2021, and became engaged in April 2022. But they ended their relationship, confirming their split on February 21.\n“Avril and Mod Sun have been on and off for the past two months, but are no longer together as a couple,” an insider told People. \nMod Sun posted in early March that his life had “completely changed” on Instagram.\n“In 1 week my entire life completely changed,” he said in the caption. “I just know there’s a plan for it all. 💔 Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing. I have the best friends in the entire world, thanks for always having my back. See you on stage.”\nAfter eight months together, singer Camila Cabello and Lox Club CEO Austin Kevitch split up after first being linked in summer of 2022. Entertainment Tonight reports that the news broke when a newsletter for Lox Club subscribers stated that, “Austin is single again.” \nIn news that shook the reality TV fandom, Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix broke it off in March 2023 after nine years together. The breakup was famously instigated by Sandoval's ongoing affair with Vanderpump Rules costar Raquel Leviss. \n“They had been having problems for a while, but this was the final straw for Ariana,” and insider told People. “She put up with a lot over the years, but she won't sit back and be disrespected this way.”\nMaddie Ziegler and Eddie Benjamin went public with their relationship in March 2020 after about a year together, but a source close to the couple told People that the Dance Moms alum and Australian singer broke up in February after three years.\nTheir last photos together posted on Zeigler's Instagram page were three months ago around the Christmas holidays.\n\nJust days shy of their 12th wedding anniversary, Witherspoon announced on her Instagram that she and her husband Jim Toth had decided to separate. She wrote in a statement from the former couple:\nIn late July, 2023, it was reported that Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro had split and broken off their engagement after two years together. The former couple recently released a three-song EP titled RR featuring the hit song “Beso.”  \n“Yes, a few months ago Rosi and I ended our engagement,” Alejandro wrote in his Instagram Stories July 26. “There are thousands of problems that could cause a breakup, but in our case it was not due to third parties or infidelity.”\nHe added, “During the space that I am taking to assimilate all of this, erroneous public allegations have emerged, and out of the respect I have for her, our families and all that we lived through, I could not stay silent and continue to watch how they try to destroy the story of the most real love that God has permitted me to live.” \n“I never saw myself in a position of even thinking that I would have to give public statements on this matter that is so private to me,” he concluded.\nA day later, Rosalía wrote a statement on her Instagram Stories.\n“I love, respect and admire Raúl very much,” she said. “Not paying attention to the theatrics, we know what we have experienced. This moment is not easy so thanks to everyone for understanding and respecting.”\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie, announced their separation after 18 years of marriage. The couple were married in 2005. They'd actually know one another in their childhoods, but reconnected again in 2003 at a charity gala. They share three children, 15-year-old Xavier, 14-year-old Ella-Grace and 9-year-old Hadrien. \n“As always, we remain a close family with deep love and respect for each other and for everything we have built and will continue to build,” they said in a statement on Instagram. \nAriana Grande and Dalton Gomez reportedly broke up in January, but it was noted in July when the Wicked star was seen at Wimbledon without her wedding ring. Soon after, it was confirmed that she is dating her co-star Ethan Slater.\nThey first broke up in November 2021 after dating for two years.  In July of 2023, it was confirmed that model Bella Hadid had broken up a few minutes earlier. In April of 2022, she shared some more about her relationship with Vogue, saying, “I think that’s why things have been able to last. When you give other people room to have opinions on things that are so personal to you, it poisons it.”\nCamila Cabello and Shawn Mendes broke up in November of 2021, but in April of 2023 they sparked dating rumors again when they were seen kissing at Coachella. However, a source told Entertainment Tonight in June, “Shawn and Camila broke up and are no longer seeing each other. They gave things a try, but ultimately the timing isn't right for either of them. They're both staying busy and doing their own things.” \nThe couple announced their divorce on July 17, 2023, after seven years of marriage and one of dating. Manganiello filed, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split.\n“They have been growing apart for some time now and tried to resolve things, but they are focused on different areas of their lives,” a source told People. “They definitely love and respect each other, but once that initial passion dies down and other areas get in the way, then little differences get bigger.”\nShortly after their 11th wedding anniversary, Portman and Millepied reportedly separated after news of the choreographer's affair, with 25-year-old climate activist Camille Étienne, broke. They have supposedly been working on rebuilding trust because the actress wants to preserve a home for their two children.\n“Natalie believes Benjamin’s affair was a brief and stupid liaison that means nothing to him,” a source told US Weekly in August 2023.\nAfter 14 months of marriage and seven years together, Spears and Asghari separated at the end of July 2023. The marriage has “been on the rocks for months” according to a source. \nThough they have yet to comment on their alleged split, TMZ reported that Jonas and Turner's relationship has been “circling the drain” for the past six months over Labor Day weekend. He has supposedly contacted divorce lawyers in the Los Angeles area as the two face conflict over the care of their two daughters.\nAfter 27 years together, actor Hugh Jackman and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness announced in a statement to People that they were breaking up on September 15, 2023.\n“We have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage,” they wrote. “Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.”\nThe statement continued, “Our family has been and always will be our highest priority. We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love, and kindness. We greatly appreciate your understanding in respecting our privacy as our family navigates this transition in all of our lives...This is the sole statement either of us will make.”\nThe pair share two children, Oscar and Ava. They met on the set of Australian TV series Corelli, and were married a year later.\nOn Monday, October 2, Jodie Turner-Smith filed for divorce from Joshua Jackson after being married for nearly four years. They share a three-year-old child. The former couple was recently photographed together, but a source told Entertainment Tonight that they have been having issues and Turner-Smith is firm in her decision to end the marriage.\n“Jodie and Joshua have been having issues lately,” the source said. “They celebrated Jodie’s birthday on September 9 at The Flower Shop in NYC but arrived separately and left separately. It was a big party, and they were distant throughout the night and barely around each other. Jodie spent majority of the evening downstairs.”\nAnother source told US Weekly, “Joshua was clearly caught off guard by Jodie’s decision to divorce...They had their issues, as many couples do—especially two busy actors who are also juggling a child. Joshua obviously didn’t realize it was this bad, that Jodie was this unhappy.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "11 Indigenous Designers to Support on Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Always", "date": "2023-10-09 13:22:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThis month, we celebrate and honor Native American people and commemorate their histories and cultures. But the time to support Indigenous artists is year-round. Sustainability and tradition are often at the forefront of Indigenous design, whether it’s the way Keri Ataumbi  uses visual storytelling in her jewelry or the history behind Jamie Gentry’s bespoke moccasin boutique. For Amy Denet Deal of 4KINSHIP, creativity is also about telling Indigenous stories, which have so often been misunderstood or not told at all. “I want people to know we are limitless,” she says. “Our creativity has been highly coveted by the fashion industry, and for decades has been appropriated. It’s our time to step into the fashion space to tell our own stories and present our own creative visions ourselves.”  \nBy uplifting Indigenous, Native American, and First Nation-owned brands, you help grow small businesses, spread inclusivity, and encourage authentic art. “There is such a pan-indigenous view of native people, yet we are over 574 different tribes, so there is certainly not just one point of view,” Denet Deal says. We hope to see more and more of these talented visionaries sharing their perspectives in the years to come. For now, here are 11 designers to support this Indigenous Peoples’ Day—and always. \nKorina Emmerich descends from a long line of Coast Salish Territory fisherman on her father’s side, and her designs for EMME Studio often reflect that legacy. She is known for crafting beautiful jackets and shirts in bright sunset and oceanic colors, and in patterns that pay homage to the sacred relationship between humans and animals. Celebrities and politicians like Deb Haaland have worn Emmerich’s designs, and one of her creations, a wool skirt and coat, was even featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion” exhibit. At the height of the pandemic, Emmerich used her sartorial skills to help her community by crafting hundreds of face masks in traditional patterns and hues. “[Indigenous] masks can carry heavy ceremonial responsibilities in recovery and healing,” Emmerich told ELLE at the time. “Everything created is meant to be used and masks help share traditional teachings in a sort of theatrical way.”\nLauren Good Day, an Arikara-Hidatsa-Blackfeet-Plains-Cree designer, learned beadwork from her mother as a child. She then took that passion for art and traditional design and incorporated it into her eponymous contemporary clothing brand, which is known worldwide for its bright unisex graphic tees, hoodies, and pants. Her latest collection honors the “aesthetic of the flourishing Northern Plains” and features traditional floral and elk patterns in bright colors.\nGrowing up on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, Keri Ataumbi developed a love for contemporary Native American design at an early age. The Kiowa fine jeweler categorizes her work as “wearable art,” because it incorporates conceptual narrative and often features juxtaposing materials. “In the Western world, there’s been a real separation in terms of what’s art and what isn’t art,” she said in an interview. “There’s not an integrated feeling about jewelry, that jewelry is actually art and can have all the same stories and potency that a painting does.”  \nRenowned beadworker Jamie Okuma is thoughtful and eco-conscious when she comes up with her luxury designs—which often incorporate intricate patterns of florals and animals. Okuma—who is Luiseño, Shoshone-Bannock, Wailaki, and Okinawan—keeps production quantity relatively low in order to avoid overstock. “We all have those go-to pieces in our closet that we keep for years and literally wear out before we retire them,” she said in an interview. “I’m here to make the go-tos, the keepers.”\nLesley Hampton, who landed a spot on ELLE Canada’s list of designers to watch, credits her Anishinaabe and Mohawk heritage for shaping her work. Hampton’s sleek designs, which bring to light issues like mental health via phrases and sayings emblazoned on them, have been spotted on runways and red carpets (Lizzo is a fan). But that’s not why Hampton got into fashion. “I’ve been doing a lot of growing up and discovering my Indigeneity,” she told ELLE Canada. “I use the collection as a catalyst for figuring out my identity. Being able to present that with beautiful garments on the runway is just a bonus.”\nJamie Gentry is from the Kwakwaka’wakw Nation, and grew up immersed in a world full of traditional culture and art—particularly sewing, beading, and weaving. She took that deep-rooted passion for all things handmade and turned it into a bona fide bespoke moccasin-making business. Each pair is custom-made and, Gentry says on her site, says “infused with love.”\nAs a teenager, Tania Larsson immersed herself in her Gwich’in culture—teaching herself how to make traditional jewelry and beaded garments. She found a mentor in Ataumbi, featured above on this list. After apprenticing under the designer for two years, Larsson began making her own beautiful jewelry under her brand Gwich’in Fine Jewellery, which she described in an interview as “a conduit that creates connections between the land, animals, elders, hunters, community members, and the wearer.” \nFast fashion didn’t suit artistic designer Amy Denet Deal. So in 2018, she left her corporate fashion job in Los Angeles and headed to New Mexico. Inspired by the sense of sustainability of her native Navajo community, Deal launched 4KINSHIP as a woman-led “artwear” brand focused on upcycling and producing one-of-a-kind clothing and accessories and uplifting Indigenous communities, particularly those in the Southwest where 4KINSHIP is based. She also founded the 4KINSHIP Indigenous Futures Fund to help incubate emerging talents and encourage Native creativity and expression. \nThunderVoice Hat Co. is one of Denet Deal’s personal favorites for its “exquisite upcycled luxury products.” ThunderVoice does offer an array of high-end hats and jewelry, but you can also find a wide variety of smaller items that would be perfect for gifting, like stickers, pins, and fanny packs. One thing that is particularly special at TVHC is the art. You can find classic works like “Girl With a Pearl Earring”  and “American Gothic” reimagined through a Native American lens. The results are stunning. \nThere’s only one Indigenous denim brand in the entire world—one!—and it’s Ginew. This brand takes modern Native American style and adds inflections of Ojibwe, Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee motifs. All of Ginew’s apparel and goods are made of the highest quality and with the utmost care and tradition. All leather goods are made with pre-industrial techniques informed by generations of craftsmanship.  \nFrom northern Arizona’s Diné (Navajo) people, comes Di’Orr Greenwood. Greenwood specializes in hand making bespoke wooden flutes, skateboard decks, and longboards. Her designs are colorful and, more importantly, meaningful. “Any art that comes from me is definitely ancestral based,” she said in a Navajo Times interview. “It’s more of a feeling.” Themes and symbols Greenwood incorporates include the four directions, elements, mountains, and the seasons. \nRose is a Senior Editor at ELLE overseeing features and projects about women's issues. She is an accomplished and compassionate storyteller and editor who excels in obtaining exclusive interviews and unearthing compelling features. \n \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions. She also co-writes a monthly column, Same Same But Different. Meg has previously written for Cosmopolitan and Town & Country. Her passions include travel, buffalo sauce, and sustainability.

{"title": "The 40 Best-Reviewed Workout Clothes on Amazon (That Happen to be Under $40)", "date": "2023-10-09 14:01:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n“Squat proof and comfy. Even my ex contacted me after posting this on my story.”\nIt’s not exactly a secret that buying cute workout clothes can help motivate you to get moving. We ELLE fashion editors fully endorse this method should you face a lack of drive, or perhaps you just want to treat yourself to a few chic new sets. That works, too. (Heck, even if you have no intention of working out, athleisure is for everyone.) \nUnfortunately, there are a lot of hidden costs when it comes to getting some exercise. From workout sneakers to pricey memberships at exclusive fitness clubs, there are so many costs that add up—even without the optional $15 green juice. The last thing you need is to spend a chunk of change on the very clothes you plan to sweat in. Thankfully, Amazon has a huge selection of wallet-friendly workout clothes that are too cute to stay hidden in your closet. From flirty skorts to functional workout leggings, we scoured the retailer for the best Amazon workout sets and clothes, as confirmed by thousands of satisfied customer reviews, in order to help you get stylish, affordable, and comfortable looks all while enjoying fast and free Prime shipping. \nPlus, with Amazon Prime Big Deal Days just around the corner (October 10 and October 11), these prices are likely to dip even lower. Ahead, find our ultimate guide to Amazon activewear finds under $50 that boast a quality that feels thrice the price. Making your purchase all the more worthwhile, these pieces are also great for lounging, working from home, or styling up with the best 2023 fashion trends\n for afternoon brunch or happy hour. \nWe’re big fans of the one-piece here at ELLE. It’s stylish, sexy, functional, and EASY. Plus, it eliminates the problem of your tee or tank top flopping into your face or riding up with every downward-facing dog. \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 90%Nylon, 10% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I love the ribbed look. Definitely surprised to find such a great, quality jumpsuit on Amazon. It’s true to size. I’ve ordered multiple colors. I love it so much.”\nWhy sacrifice style for functionality when you can have both? This ribbed one-shoulder sports bra and leggings set comes in six muted colorways and is sure to keep you comfortable and supported.\nSizes: XS-M \nMaterial: 92% Nylon, 8% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I love everything about this set. It’s ribbed, and the fabric feels wonderful...The fabric is both rich and luxurious. The bra support is medium impact...This set is so flattering and just a dream to wear in the gym!”\nSometimes you just need a sports bra that doubles as your top. This one does that! Plus, the square neckline is very on-trend. \nSizes: 2XS-XL\nMaterialL: 81% Polyamide, 19% Lycra \nCustomer review: “The fit was great and it didn’t give my 32DD bust even a hint of uniboob problems. Only thing that some people might dislike is even though it has removable cups if you have a tendency to nip out hard it will show through the cups a little.”\nWho said activewear had to be boring? Check out these printed biker shorts that come in a ton fun prints and feature flattering seams above the booty. \nSizes: 2XS-3XL \nMaterial: 75% Nylon, 25% Spandex\nCustomer review: “When I say these are my favorite work out shorts. They do not have a front seam so you don’t have to worry about it being uncomfortable while you’re moving around, and the waist seam is tight but not uncomfortable so they never slip down. They are not the slightest bit see though...not to mention how flattering they are, i have them in 6 colors.”\nThis seamless bra and shorts set comes in eight sophisticated shades with a ribbed detail that gives way to just enough elasticity so it remains ridiculously comfortable while keeping you supported. \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 90% Nylon, 10% Elastane\nCustomer review: “It fits perfectly. It looked like I was photoshopped in real life. The top has padding in it so it will shape you and push you up, and the bottoms are very secure and will suck you in.”\nFor a durable pair of ankle leggings that are sure to flatter you from every angle, we think we’ve found a winner. This nylon-spandex style has a seamless, no-dig waistband and is ideal for those who prefer lighter compression out of their leggings. Not to mention these also feature deep pockets so you can go hands-free (the way to be).\nSizes: XS-2XL\nMaterial: 80% Nylon, 20% Spandex\nCustomer review: “This pair in particular was far better for me personally than its ‘buttery soft’ counterparts. I’ve had six kids, so I have mama fluff and prefer athletic pants with more waist support. These stay tight and in place all day and help flatten my tummy.”\nDesigned to offer medium support for A to C cup, this versatile workout tank with a built-in bra and elegant twist detailing at the back will transform your athleisure game. \nSizes: XS-XL\nMaterial: 75% Polyester, 25% Spandex\nCustomer review: “The coverage is great, and I can wear it to sleep without my girls falling out of it, to my Turbo Kick class, and to play volleyball and feel fully supported. It is also surprisingly stretchy, enough that I can pull it up or down to nurse my baby.”\nMany of the 33 color options here come with a three-piece set: bike shorts, a short-sleeve crop top, and a spaghetti strap sports bra.  Reviewers mention the material is thick and compressive in the best possible ways. \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 90% Nylon, 10% Spandex\nCustomer review: “An absolute must-get. This set is unbelievably comfortable, stretchy, and hugs your body in the best places.”\nAvailable in 17 colors and prints, this sports bra and biker shorts set is thick, doesn’t bunch up, and will make you look and feel great. Bonus: The straps are also adjustable so you can get just the right fit.\nSizes: S-XL\nMaterial: 90% Nylon, 10% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I love this set, it’s so thick and compresses the tummy area. Squat proof and comfy. Even my ex contacted me after posting this on my story.” \nA white tank is my personal favorite when it comes to workout tops. This elegant padded high-high top looks as stunning for a day out as it does in the gym. Plus, reviewers confirm how ridiculously comfortable and flattering it is.\nSizes: S-XL\nMaterial: N/A \nCustomer review: “I could easily own every color they make, wear one every day and replace my actual bras. They are that comfortable!”\nElevate your leggings look with this high-neck top that features a built-in sports bra. Done in 10 sophisticated colors and super-soft polyamide, this second-skin active top is great for a workout just as much as it is for going out.\nSizes: XS-XL\nMaterial: 81% Polyamide, 19% Spandex\nCustomer review: “It’s nearly impossible for me to find a tight and flattering tank crop top that covers my side boob like this one does. Thick, buttery soft material with no rips/tears, and it’s comfortable?!? I literally don’t have a single complaint.”\nLooking for a perky lift while keeping everything in? This flattering pushup tank will carry you through your workout in style. \nSizes: S-XL\nMaterial: 77% Polyamide, 23% Spandex\nCustomer review: “This bra feels very well made and has a buttery soft feel. There is no digging and no side boob or underarm fat spillage for me. This makes my boobs sit way up and say hello!”\nWith over 21,000 reviews, these Amazon-favorite biker shorts featuring four-way stretch fabric and a thick, high waistband come in 24 prints and colors and will carry you from your morning yoga class to every errand you could possibly need to run. The best part? Two words: deep pockets.\nSizes: XS-2XL\nMaterial: 88% Polyester, 12% Spandex\nCustomer review: “I’m an avid runner and have gone through hundreds of pairs of running shorts, and these are by far the best ones. They fit perfectly, they’re high waisted and also aren’t too short so they stop your thighs from chafing on longer runs. Added bonus, the side pocket kept my phone in place perfectly so I no longer have to wear a running belt. The added weight didn’t make my shorts slide down, either.”\nAlready have a favorite sports bra? Throw one of these breathable ribbed tanks on top that come in a pack of four in various colors. With over 39,000 reviews, shoppers rave they’re also great for just about any leisurely activity. \nSizes: S-2XL\nMaterial: 92% Cotton, 8% Spandex\nCustomer review: “Something to sleep in or wear under a sweater. Very comfortable, absolutely love.”\nJoggers and leggings are both top-tier pant styles in their own right—separately. So the idea of putting them together into one hybrid pant? Genius. With a little extra give for those who prefer it in and out of the gym, this sweat-wicking pair has a slim fit and smoothing high waistband. \nSizes: XS-2XL\nMaterial: 75% Nylon, 25% Spandex\nCustomer review: “One of the best combos since PB&J. The style is perfect and the comfort level is too! I work with animals all day so not only is comfort an issue, so is durability, flexibility, and style. These pants meet every single one! Plus they almost repel fur!”\nFor when you have the gym at 6 and dinner with the girls at 7. This long sleeve ribbed crop top is the perfect top to transition through all parts of your busy day. Not only does it look elegant paired with a sleek maxi skirt or your favorite pair of jeans but it is supportive enough to get you through your toughest HIIT session.

Not to mention, they are sold in packs of 2! \nSizes: S-L\nMaterial: 70% Nylon, 25% Polyester, 5% Spandex\nCustomer review: “These crop tops are perfect for any occasion! I’ll wear them with sweatpants for everyday wear or for a night out.”\nWith full back coverage and a playful neckline, this seamless ribbed sports bra and legging set comes in 11 shades.

I want it in every color. Especially the top omg talk about tata lift!” \nAvailable in 10 prints and colors, this sports bra with a statement-making back is a showstopper for low-impact workouts. A mesh lining also helps keep you cool.\nSizes: XS-XL\nMaterial: 71% Polyamide, 29% Spandex\nCustomer review: “This is my favorite sports bra right now! Perfect amount of support for being a 34DD. Great material and super flattering.”\nWhether you’re layering with a cute crop for added warmth in the winter, or you’re not quite ready to bare it all in just a sports bra at the gym, long-sleeve workout tops are an underrated choice. And the reviews are flooded with comments about how flattering this particular one is on all body types.
