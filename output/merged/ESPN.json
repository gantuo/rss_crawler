{"title": "Connor Bedard and the rookies you need to know", "date": "2023-09-27 19:53:55", "text": "Several fresh-faced NHL newbies are not only poised to make an impact on the ice in their respective markets but within the field of fantasy hockey as well. Here's a look at 10 such rookies invested managers will want to watch closely heading into the 2023-24 fantasy season.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nConnor Bedard, F, Chicago Blackhawks: First off, a hearty congratulations to every dynasty/keeper league manager blessed with this year's precious No. 1 draft selection. Not only is the pick itself a no-brainer, but the runaway Calder favorite is likely to pay out rich fantasy dividends for years and years to come. Straight out of the gates, we know Bedard is poised to provide a hearty serving of minutes on the Blackhawks' top line and power play alongside veteran Taylor Hall. There's little question of that.\nAll that's left to forecast is whether he scores 60, 80, or near 100 points. My preseason guess is somewhere in the point/game range, at least to start. Hardly matters though; if you have the chance to pick Bedard in dynasty play, you're picking him. Otherwise, he initially presents as a Top-35 fantasy forward in re-draft leagues.\nAdam Fantilli, F, Columbus Blue Jackets: The kid out of Nobleton, Ontario is also supposed to be pretty good. A standout at September's Traverse City prospect tournament, Fantilli appeared NHL-ready in every way, beyond the potting of seven points on 15 shots through two games. Happily launching camp on a top-six line with Patrik Laine (\"yeah, it's going great, obviously, [Laine's] really easy to play with\"), the gifted center is endeavouring to lay a foundation for an outstanding rookie campaign.\nAfter scoring 65 points in 36 games as a freshman with the University of Michigan - and winning the Hobey Baker award - Fantilli should earn regular opportunities to prove he can hang with the grownups. Especially since this Blue Jackets squad is still a year or two away from making serious noise in the East. He's my favorite forward pick in dynasty competition outside of the young fella in Chicago.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever! Set your league size, select your keepers, and invite your friends to start playing. Sign up for free today be the commish!\nMarco Rossi, F, Minnesota Wild: If, and we're talking a mammoth-sized if here, he gets a shot at playing on the Wild's top line, the just-turned 22-year-old could be in for one heck of a first full round in the NHL. Many will argue that, after potting 51 points in 53 games with the AHL Wild in 2022-23, Rossi merits at least a chance to compete between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello, but he'll have to leapfrog Frederick Gaudreau Joel Eriksson Ek, and Ryan Hartman (when healthy again) to get there. A role in the bottom-six doesn't harbor anywhere near the same fantasy promise.\nKeep a close view on where the ninth-overall draft pick (2020), now three years removed from battling COVID-related myocarditis, lines up in camp.\nMatthew Knies, F, Toronto Maple Leafs: Fellow Arizonan Auston Matthews, after training with the young winger this summer, had this to say, \"He's very driven. Physically, he's more than capable of playing all 82 games and being a really good player for us.\"\nToss in a promising gig on the Leafs' second line alongside center John Tavares, plus a spot on the No. 2 power play, and we might have a fresh productive fantasy force in Toronto this season. Knies potted 21 goals and 21 assists in 40 games with the University of Minnesota before collecting five in 10 with his NHL club, including four in seven postseason contests.\nLogan Cooley, F, Arizona Coyotes: Part of the Coyotes' \"present\", as well as their future, according to coach Andre Tourigny, Cooley is already turning heads in his post-Collegiate career (see below). The advantage of playing for a rebuilding club unencumbered by ambitious expectations at present is that he'll earn plenty of minutes and ripe opportunities to do the same all season long. Why not? If not for Fantilli's exceptional showing, Cooley's 60 points as a freshman with the University of Minnesota may have sufficed in winning him the Hobey Baker. Even the most frustrated Coyotes fan can feel legitimately excited about this raw star. Fantasy managers should too.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nMatt Coronato, F, Calgary Flames: Toss the Harvard lad on the right side of Nazem Kadri (again), and let him strut his scoring stuff, is my advice. With new GM Craig Conroy and bench boss Ryan Huska at the helm, the soon-to-turn 21-year-old should earn a fair shake at the chance to fill one of the Flames' handful of vacancies up front.\nA dynamic scoring winger, Coronato has impressed at every level to date, including with the USHL Chicago Steel and in college competition. His eight points in 10 games at the 2023 IIHF men's World Championships this past May more than proves he can keep up with experienced, fully-grown pros. An obvious top-tier selection in dynasty leagues, the 13th overall draft pick (2021) could make a tangible scoring impact as soon as now.\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nLuke Hughes, D, New Jersey Devils: Long after the novelty of watching him compete on the same team as older brother Jack wears off, the youngest Hughes sibling will still be putting up points with regularity. It's only a matter of time before he supplants, or joins Dougie Hamilton, on the Devils' top power play. An immediate must-grab in keeper play, this fourth-overall draft pick (2021) already sports value in all but the shallowest of conventional re-draft fantasy leagues.\nBrandt Clarke, D, Los Angeles Kings: Having enjoyed the privilege of watching this kid compete for the Barrie Colts in person on a handful of occasions, I can assure you he's something special. A future key piece of the Kings' blue line, and top prospect at large, the 20-year-old has accomplished all he can in the OHL, and feels ready to play full-time with the club that drafted him eighth overall in 2021 (ahead of Arizona's Dylan Guenther, Coronato, and Stars' center Wyatt Johnston).\nBeing in the position to learn from one of the game's best in Drew Doughty certainly won't hurt either. While his most explosive fantasy days lie ahead, Clarke still merits monitoring in the here and now. The young defender scored 61 points in only 31 games with the Colts this past season,\nDevon Levi, G, Buffalo Sabres: As discussed in ESPN.com's fantasy goalie preview, I'm all in on Levi's potential to make the Sabres' roster this season. Maybe not right out of camp, but eventually. And once offered a spot on hockey's largest stage, I do expect him to hold his own. Lack of NHL experience aside, the 21-year-old is bright, skilled, disciplined, hardworking, and confident without seeming concerningly arrogant. A bit small, by goalie standards, but so was Henrik Lundqvist and he managed well enough.\nThis kid's all-around vibe has me convinced he's ready to sub in if/when Eric Comrie or Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen falter or fall hurt. Again, now or later. Adding to this already promising fantasy formula is that Buffalo is already good and only getting better.\nJoseph Woll, G, Toronto Maple Leafs: Unlike Levi in Western New York, Toronto's rookie netminder is expected to make his big-league club out of camp. Serving as a pro since 2019, he can't be sent down to the minors without being subjected to waivers, and fat chance Brad Treliving and Co. take that swing.\nSo, unless injured, he's going to play. More pressing to fantasy managers and Leafs' fans alike, on the assumption that Martin Jones only enters the goaltending mix should Ilya Samsonov or Woll fall hurt, is how well and how much. While seven NHL games hardly count as many, the 25-year-old won over a gazillion Toronto fans by posting a 6-1-0 record, 2.16 GAA, and .932 SV% in 2022-23. Dazzling stuff. One of the league's sneakier sleeper picks between the pipes, with a top-quality club in Toronto, Woll could conduct himself as a game-changer for fantasy managers in 2023-24. He just needs to play.\nSee also:\nTyson Foerster, F, Philadelphia Flyers\nLeo Carlsson, F, Anaheim Ducks\nJoel Hofer, G, St. Louis Blues\nReady to play? Sign up for free today!"}
{"title": "Week 5 takeaways: Revved for Red River, ACC's Notre Dame problem", "date": "2023-10-02 15:03:55", "text": "Quinn Ewers rushes for two touchdowns and throws for another, leading Texas to a big win over Kansas. (1:26)\nWith Week 5 of the college football season in the books, we're seeing some intriguing storylines beyond the Big Two conferences of the SEC and Big Ten.\nThe Red River Rivalry is lined up to be one of the biggest games in the series' recent history, West Virginia has emerged as a surprise in the Big 12 and Louisville is experiencing a resurgence in the ACC. (But can the Cardinals slay Notre Dame?)\nHere's a look at our reporters' key takeaways from this weekend's action.\nThe Longhorns and Sooners are heading to Dallas for a matchup that feels, on paper, more like their legendary early 2000s heavyweight fights.\nIn 2009, No. 3 Texas versus No. 20 Oklahoma rumbled to a 16-13 Longhorns win that then-Texas coach Mack Brown said \"was more like a fight\" a year after Texas' 45-35 victory.\nThis year, following a historic 49-0 blowout of the Sooners, No. 3 Texas faces No. 12 Oklahoma in a matchup that will mark just the third time both teams are at least 5-0 (2008 and 2002).\nLast year, Oklahoma fell to 6-7 after allowing 461 yards and 30 points per game. The Sooners signed seven ESPN 300 defensive recruits, their most since the rankings began in 2006. One of those signees, safety Peyton Bowen, the No. 17 overall player in the class, leads Oklahoma with four passes broken up and has blocked two punts. OU has allowed just 54 points this season, fewest by a Big 12 team over the first five games since ... 2009, when Oklahoma and Nebraska both did it.\nTexas, meanwhile, is 5-0 for the first time since 2009, the last time it won the Big 12. The Longhorns beat No. 24 Kansas by 26 points on Saturday, their largest win in an AP-ranked matchup since 2009 against Oklahoma State.\nThe two offenses had huge days this past weekend. Oklahoma lit up Iowa State with 523 yards, while Texas had 661 yards, its most in a conference game since the Big 12 began in 1996. Oklahoma has scored 50 or more points in three of its first five games of a season for the first time since 2008.\nIt looks like a fitting throwback matchup for the teams' final Big 12 version of their historic rivalry, once again with massive implications: According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, the winner of the 2023 edition will have better than a 70% chance to reach the College Football Playoff, while the loser will have about a 30% chance. -- Dave Wilson\nSo much for preseason polls and coaching hot seat lists. Neal Brown and West Virginia have deposited both in the rubbish bin with a 4-1 start, capped by an impressive road win on Saturday at TCU. West Virginia was picked last in the Big 12 preseason media poll, a forecast that Brown duly noted, saying in July, \"Looking forward to proving everybody wrong on that front. We won't finish there.\"\nBrown certainly faced pressure to win, and a seemingly daunting September schedule included Penn State, Pitt, Texas Tech and TCU. But many forget that even though last season didn't go well overall, West Virginia swept the Oklahoma schools and beat defending Big 12 champion Baylor. The Mountaineers returned some experienced players, especially on defense. Brown told me last week that he especially likes his defensive front, which includes junior Sean Martin and promising redshirt freshman Tomiwa Durojaiye. WVU's defense has shined during its start, allowing only 19 points per game and 3.3 yards per rush. Although Brown has a background on offense, a unit that has struggled for much of his tenure, he has found ways to generate wins and positive vibes.\nThe Mountaineers get a well-timed open week -- they emerged from the TCU outing fairly banged up -- before facing struggling Houston and Oklahoma State. They miss Texas on the schedule, so a solid bounce-back season and some stability for Brown seem well within reach. -- Adam Rittenberg\nFor the first time, Kentucky and Louisville are both 5-0 to start the season. (No, we're not talking hoops.) Both teams are also about to get a much better test of how good they really are.\nKentucky, coming off a 33-14 beatdown of Florida on Saturday at home, will travel to No. 1 Georgia. Louisville, which slipped past host NC State 13-10 on Friday, will return home to face Notre Dame.\nThe Kentucky program is as healthy as it's been under Mark Stoops, who is in his 11th season. Winning three in a row over Florida would have sounded like a fairy tale during the Wildcats' 31-game losing streak in the series from 1987 to 2007. But Stoops has stayed the course, made adjustments (such as getting Liam Coen back as offensive coordinator and plugging in key transfers such as QB Devin Leary, RB Ray Davis, WR Tayvion Robinson, OT Marques Cox, S Zion Childress and PK Alex Raynor) and maintained a tough, blue-collar approach that has served this team well. The Wildcats are averaging 6.5 yards per rush and holding their opponents to only 2.5 yards per rush.\nThe Cardinals, in Jeff Brohm's first season back at his alma mater, are 3-0 in conference play for the first time as an ACC member. They've teetered at times against their Power 5 opponents and squeaked past NC State thanks to a 53-yard field goal by Brock Travelstead in the final six minutes. But they've also found different ways to win. Louisville averaged 237 rushing yards in its first four games, but with the running game stuffed last week, it leaned on its defense. The Cardinals held the Wolfpack scoreless in the second half and forced two turnovers.\nLouisville has only two road games remaining on its schedule. Kentucky has four road dates left, including three of its last four contests. It's a stretch to think either of these teams is going to contend for a playoff berth, but their season-ending clash on Nov. 25 could be the most anticipated in years, with the winner potentially having a chance to win nine-plus games. -- Chris Low\nSpeaking of Louisville, the Cardinals have a chance to do something no other ACC team has done in the regular season since Miami in 2017: Beat Notre Dame.\nDuke was two minutes away from doing it Saturday night. Its defense then gave up two big plays on the final drive, Notre Dame scored the winning touchdown with 31 seconds left and a long winning streak was extended. The Fighting Irish have won 30 straight regular-season ACC games, passing Florida State (1992 to 1995) for the longest such streak.\nNotre Dame takes a lead on Audric Estime's 30-yard touchdown against Duke with 31 seconds left.\nThere are two key differences here: (1) Nobody will ever confuse the Notre Dame teams of the past five years with those dominant Florida State teams (no offense Irish, these are just facts) and (2) unlike Florida State, Notre Dame is not actually an ACC member in football, which is the biggest gut punch of all for the league.\nThe ACC literally asked for this when the Irish joined the league for the 2013-14 season in all sports but football and men's hockey. A football scheduling partnership -- in which Notre Dame would play five or six ACC teams annually -- seemed like a win-win decision at the time. Notre Dame would get help filling out its schedule; the ACC would get help by boosting its nonconference scheduling and creating more attractive matchups for TV.\nBut this has been a losing proposition in recent years. Though Clemson did defeat Notre Dame in the 2020 ACC championship game and has previously beaten the Irish both in the regular season and the College Football Playoff, nobody else has had close to the same success. That speaks more to the state out of the league outside Clemson, as the ACC works to enhance its football teams.\nThis year has been a much better start, with six undefeated teams through the first four weeks. But even undefeated Duke could not get the job done. Undefeated Louisville is up next. The rest of Notre Dame's ACC schedule for this season? Pitt, at Clemson and Wake Forest. Someone in the ACC has to find a way to step up and end the streak once and for all, for the good of the conference. -- Andrea Adelson\nWith the Pac-12 home to four of the top six offenses nationally (Washington, Oregon, USC and Washington State), Utah knew its quest for a three-peat would be a daunting one. Friday's performance at Oregon State, where Utah couldn't crack 200 total yards in a 21-7 loss, only strengthens the fact that the Utes need Cameron Rising back fast.\nUtah's offense ranks last in the conference (297.6 yards per game), and Rising would provide some much-needed stability to a unit that went five straight quarters without scoring prior to tight end Thomas Yassmin's TD reception in the fourth against the Beavers. The schedule is about to get amped up to another gear, with two of Utah's next three games following a bye week coming against USC and Oregon. If Rising (18-7 career record with 45 touchdown passes) can make his 2023 season debut on Oct. 14 against California and get his feet wet for the stretch run, the Utes' quest to keep the Pac-12 title in Salt Lake City for another year will receive a serious boost. -- Blake Baumgartner\nIn a decisive win over Mississippi State, quarterback Jalen Milroe was efficient, the Crimson Tide got its running game going and the defense had four sacks. This is all a positive push toward Alabama reasserting itself on the national stage, but as coach Nick Saban said after the game, the team isn't where it wants to be or needs to be.\nMilroe throws a nice deep ball, but nobody is going to mistake him for the nation's most prolific passer -- especially when he only threw it 12 times on Saturday. If this is Bama's identity, though, then embrace it and continue to make it better. No two-loss team has been to the CFP, which makes this Saturday's game between Alabama and Texas A&M critical. They each have a nonconference loss and are squarely in the mix to win the SEC West. The winner will have a huge edge. -- Heather Dinich"}

{"title": "MMA storylines to watch for the rest of 2023: Rematches galore, vacant titles aplenty", "date": "2023-10-02 15:32:04", "text": "The final quarter of the year is upon us. Things have been hectic -- and newsworthy -- in MMA in 2023.\nFrom a business perspective, the UFC has merged with WWE to form the publicly traded company TKO, under Endeavor. In the cage, UFC titles have been veritable hot potatoes. There have been 10 title changes in the promotion this year, if you include fighters vacating belts because of retirement or injury.\nThe UFC has three more pay-per-view cards before the year ends, and at least five titles will be on the line. Bellator 300 is a few days away, on Saturday in San Diego, with four title fights. PFL still has to decide its entire slate of 2023 championships in November.\nWhat should fans watch over the next three months before the ball drops, sending us into 2024? ESPN MMA insiders Marc Raimondi, Brett Okamoto, Jeff Wagenheim, Andres Waters and Myron Medcalf glance at the top storylines for the rest of the year.\nTom Aspinall finishes Marcin Tybura within the first 90 seconds of the first round of the main event.\nThe UFC 295 main event on Nov. 11 is one of the biggest heavyweight title fights ever. In terms of pure achievements, it's the biggest. Jon Jones is the longtime former UFC light heavyweight champion and a man who is unbeaten in 18 straight fights. Dial that back even more: Jones has never truly been beaten -- his only loss came via questionable disqualification. Stipe Miocic, the challenger in New York, is a two-time former UFC heavyweight champion with a record four total title defenses. His three straight title defenses are also a UFC heavyweight record.\nAs if that isn't significant enough -- the light heavyweight GOAT against the heavyweight GOAT -- what happens after the fight is completely in question. Miocic is 41 years old and a full-time firefighter, and this will be his first fight since March 2021. There's a solid chance that, win or lose, Miocic will retire after UFC 295. Miocic told me in an interview last week that it was a possibility, but only because he's thought about retirement after every one of his fights, going back to his first UFC bout. We'll see.\nMeanwhile, Jones has said on several occasions that this could be it for him. Whether that's a negotiating ploy is up for debate. But Jones is 36 years old. He won his first UFC title when he was 23, the youngest to do it. There is nothing Jones has accomplished. His legacy as the greatest MMA fighter is all but set. Even beating Miocic would just be gravy -- another on a list of Jones accomplishments that could barely fit on one of those lengthy drugstore receipts.\nSo, what would heavyweight look like without Jones and Miocic? The two names that immediately come to mind are Tom Aspinall and Sergei Pavlovich. The former is a well-rounded Brit who can finish a fight anywhere. Aspinall is on the verge of being a big star in the United Kingdom and beyond. The latter is a hard-hitting Russian, a modern-day Drago with size and enormous power. Aspinall and Pavlovich seem to be on a collision course, regardless of the result of UFC 295. Whether that's a title eliminator or a flat-out title fight will be determined on Nov. 11. The heavyweight division will be in good hands with them, but it would be cool to see one get a shot at a Jones or Miocic in a potential passing-the-torch fight.\nI'm curious how the UFC handles these potential rematches. Rematches can be good for the sport and draw a lot of attention. Any time you have a rematch, you have a built-in storyline. But how many will the UFC sign up for? It can't be a year of rematches.\nAnd if you look at each division, it's rematches galore right now. Alexa Grasso vs. Valentina Shevchenko, trilogy. Sean Strickland vs. Israel Adesanya, rematch. Islam Makhachev vs. Charles Oliveira, rematch. Alexander Volkanovski vs. just about any featherweight after Ilia Topuria, rematch. Volkanovski vs. Makhachev, rematch. Sean O'Malley vs. Marlon Vera, rematch. Alexandre Pantoja vs. Brandon Royval, rematch. Pantoja vs. Brandon Moreno, tetralogy.\nThere are some great fights in there, for sure. But does the sport need a year in which nearly half of the major UFC pay-per-view events are matchups we've already seen? Depending on what happens in some of these divisions, we could be looking at more potential rematch situations. Leon Edwards vs. Kamaru Usman 3? Colby Covington vs. Usman 3? Volkanovski vs. Holloway 4? As Dana White likes to say, we'll see how things play out -- but I could see a scenario in which we are debating the merit of plenty of rematches during the next 12 months.\nEarlier this year, Bellator announced that it would be launching a men's flyweight division with former bantamweight champion Kyoji Horiguchi taking on Rizin's Makoto Takahashi for the new title at Bellator MMA vs. Rizin 2 on July 29. But that didn't go as planned -- just seconds into the match, an accidental eye poke by Horiguchi forced the fight to be ruled a no contest, leaving Bellator without a champion for its new division on its inaugural night.\nThere are plenty of questions surrounding the division, but two questions are the most important. The first is obvious: Will there be a rematch for the 125-pound title? Since that fight, the promotion hasn't announced any plans to run it back. Second, and most importantly, who's on the men's flyweight roster? Despite having a fight for the title, Bellator has yet to say anything regarding the fighters it has picked up to fill out this division. It's not an ideal way to introduce a new weight class. Hopefully, we can get some answers sooner rather than later.\nAmanda Nunes leaves her belts and gloves in the Octagon after announcing her retirement from fighting at UFC 289.\nThe UFC women's featherweight and bantamweight divisions have been without a champion ever since Amanda Nunes retired at UFC 289 in June. A month later, Jamahal Hill announced he was vacating the light heavyweight title after rupturing his Achilles tendon. So now 25% of the weight classes in the sport's leading promotion have vacancies at the top.\nThe vacancies themselves are not what's concerning. Retirements and, sadly, career-interrupting injuries happen. What matters here is the UFC's urgency -- or lack of urgency -- in filling those essential positions.\nThe bean counters at the UFC no doubt are more concerned with sorting out the Conor McGregor soap opera, because a \"Notorious\" return would get a standing ovation from TKO stockholders. But fans deserve better. As fun as it used to be to watch McGregor fight, hasn't the circus surrounding him grown tiresome? Every time McGregor rolls into town, it distracts the sport from what matters: the quest to be the best.\nThe UFC is working on it at light heavyweight. Jiří Procházka and Alex Pereira will tangle for the belt at UFC 295 in a tantalizing clash of former champions -- Procházka at light heavy, Pereira at middleweight -- who are standup standouts of very different styles. There's nothing on the books, however, for reestablishing supremacy at women's bantamweight and featherweight.\nLet's get those divisions topped before the end of the year. There's no need to wait for a matchup as brilliant as Procházka vs. Pereira to emerge. The next Amanda Nunes is not out there. But the UFC's 135- and 145-pound women need someone to chase, and fans deserve more shiny belts to follow.\nAlexa Grasso retains her flyweight title after a split draw with former flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\nFor years, Shevchenko owned the women's flyweight division. At 125 pounds, she had been the mayor, the sheriff and the deputy, as she defended her belt seven times in a row. Then she faced Grasso, the current champion who upset Shevchenko earlier this year and then kept the belt via a controversial draw last month. Grasso's emergence has not only changed the division, but the titleholder and her colleagues could also change the UFC.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Passan predicts the MLB playoffs »\n• Connelly's September CFB truths »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nThe 125-pound women's landscape is no longer dominated by one fighter. Grasso and Shevchenko will eventually meet a third time -- once Shevchenko heals from a hand injury -- but she's not the only threat to Grasso's throne. Erin Blanchfield hasn't lost since February 2019. The jiu-jitsu specialist has four submissions in that run. Who wants to fight her? Manon Fiorot toyed with Rose Namajunas, the former strawweight champ, when they met in September. Fiorot has won her last 11 fights. Who wants to fight her? And a Maycee Barber-Grasso rematch -- Grasso beat Barber via unanimous decision in 2021, Barber's most recent loss -- also makes sense. Plus, Jessica Andrade is always a handful at 115 or 125 pounds.\nThere are enough fights to turn 125 pounds into the UFC's most competitive and fascinating division in the years ahead, especially with the possibility of a few 115-pound fighters moving up. There has always been talk about Zhang Weili potentially chasing a second belt at 125 pounds. But the return of Tatiana Suarez -- the undefeated fighter who beat Andrade at 115 pounds in August, her second bout after a four-year layoff -- makes things interesting for two divisions. Suarez has fought at 125 pounds, and she's a serious contender in both weight classes. Who wants to fight her?\nAnd that's the beauty of the UFC. For years, we just wondered whom Shevchenko would dismiss next. Now, the months and years ahead could feature a gauntlet in the women's flyweight division that boosts the entire UFC."}

Blaney in his Ford for Team Penske and Harvick in a Ford for Stewart-Haas Racing finished essentially in a drag race with both drivers refusing to lift as a crash broke out behind them.\n\"I've won it by more than I have the last couple years. That one might have been by 4 feet, the others were by 2 but you just don't know,\" said Blaney, a three-time winner at Talladega. \"You just kind of drag race a line and hope you get help.\"\nBlaney joined William Byron as the two drivers locked into the round of eight. The field of 12 will be pared next Sunday to eight following the race on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nBlaney boss Roger Penske praised the strategy of the Ford camp to work together to ensure a Ford victory as the Chevrolets from Hendrick Motorsports were making a quick challenge.\n\"For Harvick, who it was his last race here, working like he did with Ryan, it was amazing to see that,\" said Penske. \"The Hendrick freight train was coming and we all stayed together, that was the call that Ford had earlier in the day when we talked. It was just perfect execution.\"\nFord has won 10 playoff races at Talladega, most at any track, and Team Penske has won 10 of the last 18 races at the 2.66-mile Alabama oval.\nBlaney, winner of the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte in May, now has multiple wins in a season for the second time in his career. But he's got a lopsided stat this season in that he has only five top-five finishes, but two wins.\n\"It was a pretty wild restart, let alone the last couple of laps, losing momentum and getting it back, just getting clear to the bottom to get to the front row and drag race it out with Kevin,\" said Blaney. \"To win here three times at Talladega is super cool.\"\nHarvick finished second as his winless streak stretched to 43 races dating back to last season. NASCAR said nearly two hours after the race that his Ford had been disqualified because the fasteners on his windshield were not secure.\nThe Harvick disqualification dropped him to last in the field. Byron in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports moved up to second and Denny Hamlin, who rallied from a lap down, moved up to third in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing.\nHamlin led three laps during the second stage but was flagged for speeding on pit road -- a troubling habit of the three-time Daytona 500 winner considered the best driver to never win a Cup championship -- and the penalty contributed to him falling a lap off the pace. It was Hamlin's fourth speeding penalty of the season and it took him most of the race to earn his position back on the lead lap and then drove through the field to secure his finish.\n\"Not how we drew it up, but a dub is a dub and that was a dub in our book -- it's as close as it gets to it,\" Hamlin said. \"A top-five is a long way from where we were with about 15 laps to go.\"\nCorey LaJoie, who is not in the playoffs, moved up to fourth in a Chevrolet for Spire Motorsports. Blaney teammate Austin Cindric moved to fifth and was followed by Justin Haley of Kaulig Racing in a Chevrolet, defending race winner Chase Elliott for Hendrick, and the Fords of Ryan Preece and Riley Herbst. Daniel Suarez moved up to 10th. None of the drivers who finished fourth through 10th are in the playoffs.\nThe race had 70 lead changes among 24 drivers and was fairly clean. Ross Chastain was in an early crash that caused last year's championship runner-up to finish last. Brad Keselowski was in a later crash with 28 laps to go that ended the race for him, caused damage to Talladega's outer wall and stopped all action under a red flag.\nPLAYOFF PICTURE\nEven though he crashed and finished 32nd, Keselowski remained two points above the cutline headed to Charlotte's elimination race.\nThe four drivers in jeopardy of elimination are Tyler Reddick of 23XI Racing, Chastain of Trackhouse Racing, Bubba Wallace of 23XI and Kyle Busch of Richard Childress Racing. Busch must win to advance.\nWallace had a lengthy post-race chat with 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan on pit road following his 23rd-place finish. Jordan appeared to be encouraging him, at one point placing his hand on the back of Wallace's neck and then shoulder, then pulling him in for a hug.\nCHASTAIN CRASHES OUT\nChastain, who finished second to Joey Logano last year in the championship race, finished one spot ahead of Harvick after a collision with fellow title contenders Busch and Christopher Bell on the final lap of the first stage.\nChastain entered Talladega, the middle race of the round of 12, ranked sixth in the Cup standings and 12 points above the cutline. His last-place finish dropped him below the cutline and forced him into a high-pressure situation next week on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nChastain has struggled in his four previous starts on Charlotte's hybrid road course/oval track. His best finish is 22nd.\n\"Left and right,\" he said when asked how he expects next week to go. \"I'm living my dream, so whatever our team brings next week, we'll put our best foot forward. As long as I'm getting to drive these rocket ships that Trackhouse brings me, I'm living my dream and we'll keep fighting.\"\nUP NEXT\nNASCAR races next Sunday on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where Bell won last year to avoid playoff elimination."}

{"title": "Down but not out: Jermell Charlo couldn't top Canelo Alvarez, but still has meaningful fights ahead", "date": "2023-10-02 19:25:12", "text": "Canelo Alvarez handles business with another big-time win, this time over challenger Jermell Charlo in Las Vegas. (1:47)\nLAS VEGAS -- Jermell Charlo was ringside at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in November 2021 when Canelo Alvarez faced Caleb Plant for the undisputed super middleweight championship.\nDuring the fight -- which Canelo won via 11th-round TKO -- Charlo turned to his twin brother, Jermall, and said: \"I can beat Canelo.\"\nTurns out, it's one thing to say it. It's quite another to actually do it.\nCharlo (35-2-1, 19 KOs) jumped two weight classes on Saturday in an attempt to dethrone boxing's top star, but he was no match. Alvarez won virtually every second of the fight, scored a seventh-round knockdown and earned a unanimous-decision victory to retain his four titles at 168 pounds.\nThere's no shame, of course, in losing to an all-time great like Canelo. Charlo was nearly a 4-1 underdog to upset Alvarez for many reasons.\nCharlo struggled in a loss to Tony Harrison in 2018 and a draw with Brian Castano in 2021, quality boxers who are levels below Alvarez. Charlo finished both Harrison (2019) and Castano (2022) inside the distance in rematches, which spoke well of his ability to make adjustments. But there didn't seem to be a Plan B on Saturday and he oddly seemed content after the bout to have lasted until the final bell.\n\"I'm proud of myself,\" said Charlo, who fights out of Houston. \"He didn't knock me out; he knocked all the other guys out.\"\nCharlo predicted the fight would last the 12-round distance and apparently found a moral victory in not being another Alvarez KO victim. It's a strange approach for one of the sport's most outspoken fighters.\nAfter the fight, Alvarez felt that Charlo wasn't trying to win the fight.\n\"I think that happens with a lot of fighters,\" Alvarez said. \"That's not on my mind, to survive that way. So then I did my job. I think he never [did] something to win.\"\nAs Alvarez piled up rounds, trainer Derrick James implored Charlo to be more aggressive down the stretch. But Charlo never pushed, never landed a punch of consequence and never threatened to be competitive let alone win the fight.\n\"My head is held high,\" said Charlo, who acknowledged he could have been more aggressive. \"I am proud of myself.\"\nFollowing Charlo's lackluster performance on Saturday, pound-for-pound king Terence Crawford, who was ringside to watch the fight, had some choice words for his potential future opponent.\n\"You went out sad,\" Crawford immediately posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, while tagging Charlo. \"Didn't even try to win, all you did was try to survive. You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\"I'm over Charlo, he's no longer on my hit list,\" Crawford added. \"He went out there and laid down.\"\nCharlo said \"Crawford could be on the radar,\" but it appears the feeling is no longer mutual. And if the matchup did materialize, it certainly lost a lot of luster.\nBut all is not lost for Charlo. He didn't seem to take much damage outside of the seventh-round knockdown courtesy of a Canelo overhand right and should be an improved fighter going forward after sharing the ring for 12 rounds with Alvarez.\nCharlo still has other meaningful fights in his future. After all, he remains the top guy at 154 pounds. Charlo said he only rehydrated to around 172, 173 pounds on fight night; boxers routinely gain 10-15 pounds overnight.\n\"I'm going back down to 154 so that's gonna be major,\" Charlo said. \"I can do it. I can make the weight easy.... I'm used to moving around much lighter.\"\nHowever, he's no longer the undisputed junior middleweight champion. Charlo still holds the WBA, WBC and IBF titles. But once the bell rang on Saturday, the WBO stripped Charlo and elevated Australian star Tim Tszyu from interim champion to full champion.\n\"Tim Tszyu is the [WBO junior middleweight] champion,\" WBO president Francisco \"Paco\" Valcarcel told ESPN on Monday. \"[The fight between] Tim Tszyu with [Brian] Mendoza is for the title. [Jermell] Charlo was notified when we posted the resolution online [August 3].\"\nThat resolution indicated that once Charlo got in the ring to face Canelo, instead of his mandatory challenger, Tim Tszyu, Charlo would be stripped of the belt and Tszyu \"will be automatically elevated from interim champion to full champion status.\"\n\"I would like to talk with somebody from the WBO and see what kind of issues they can resolve...,\" Charlo said. \"I gotta just continue to roll with the punches. Jermell Charlo never gets the fair end of the stick. I gotta go and fight for mine....\n\"[The WBO] must really got a relationship with the people in Australia. And that's okay with me. I just gotta continue to be a champion and continue to fight, and barnone put my heart on the line every time I get in there.\"\nOne of the opportunities to put that performance in the past will be, perhaps, a rescheduled showdown with Tszyu, who's impressed with his power and improved attack in recent fights.\nTszyu, 28, will make the first defense of his WBO title on Oct. 14 in Sydney against Brian Mendoza. The son of Hall of Famer Kostya Tszyu, Tim Tszyu was set to fight Charlo in January before Charlo broke his left hand in two places during a sparring session just a month before the scheduled bout.\nThis was his first fight since his hand was placed in a cast in January, and it was also his first time fighting a truly elite opponent. He had never fought above 154 pounds and despite being taller than Canelo, was the naturally smaller man.\nAlvarez himself said he wasn't 100% confident in his surgically repaired left wrist when he fought John Ryder in May. So it's unfair to believe that Charlo was at his best on Saturday.\nMost of all, perhaps, Charlo was contending with serious ring rust -- 16 months. His most-recent fight was in May 2022, an impressive 10th-round KO of Castano. Beginning with 2020, Charlo has fought only once a year. During that same span, Alvarez competed seven times.\nThree top fighters recently suffered defeats after long layoffs. Josh Taylor (16 months, UD loss) against Teofimo Lopez Jr., Stephen Fulton (13 months, KO8) vs. Naoya Inoue, and Errol Spence Jr. (15 months, KO9) to Crawford.\nIf Charlo can compete at least twice in 2024 and return to winning ways at 154 pounds against a fighter like Tszyu, he could still obtain the pound-for-pound recognition he so desperately seeks.\n\"I think I'm the best fighter in the world,\" Charlo said. \"I still think that right now.\""}
{"title": "Euro women's weekend review: WSL returns in style, Man United win late, Lyon down PSG", "date": "2023-10-02 20:28:19", "text": "Nedum Onuoha reacts to Arsenal breaking the WSL attendance record in their clash with Liverpool in the opening weekend of the competition. (1:52)\nAfter a summer off for good behaviour, the Women's Super League (WSL) returned on Sunday with an entertaining a day filled with goals, cards and debuts. These are the key talking points from the WSL weekend, along with some highlights from European action.\nWith WSL referees encouraged to mirror the men's game and clamp down on things like dissent and time-wasting, we saw an influx in cautions over the weekend, with an increased willingness from officials to go to their pockets for the type of fouls that have historically been overlooked in the women's game.\nIndeed, across the six games, 17 yellow cards were handed out for a variety of offences including dissent, with Aston Villa's Lucy Parker the first player to be booked this season in a match that saw six yellow cards in total issued by ref Rebecca Welch. It was a notable day in WSL that also saw two straight red cards -- for Aston Villa's Kirsty Hanson and Manchester City's Leila Ouahabi -- which hasn't happened in the league for over a decade.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nAs well as the increase in cautions, just as there was at the Women's World Cup this summer, there was ample time added on at the end of each half following new guidelines for stoppages in play, meaning some teams played well over 100 minutes of football.\nOn the topic of increased added time, particularly at the end of the second half, there was late drama at Villa Park when Manchester United claimed all three points with a stoppage-time winner from Rachel Williams. After Villa's Hanson was dismissed for a high tackle on Hayley Ladd, the hosts took a shock 1-0 lead via Rachel Daly's low shot. But Lucía García had United level within minutes, converting from a corner and setting the scene for Williams' dramatic late header from Nikita Parris' cross.\nThe Red Devils are clearly picking up where they left off from last year with their late, often game-changing, goals. Those heroics were absent for their rivals, however, with Everton (who lost 2-1 at home), Tottenham (who fell 2-1) and Arsenal (1-0 losers) all unable to find similar late goals against Brighton, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively.\nWith almost every WSL team having strengthened over the summer in hopes of bridging some of the gaps and creating a bit more parity, there was a glut of goals across the day's fixtures as well.\nOnly Manchester City (in a 2-0 win at West Ham) and Liverpool (1-0 winners at Arsenal) managed to keep their clean sheets on Sunday afternoon, thanks to the improved attacking across the league. Daly, last season's golden boot winner scored the first WSL of the campaign when she got the better of Man United keeper Mary Earps. And both Spurs and Leicester -- two teams who struggled for goals last campaign -- would have been relieved to see their new recruits finding the back of the net bag on what was, a memorable day for new signings.\nMartha Thomas scored for Tottenham in a losing effort, while Jill Roord opened the scoring for Man City in their win, but Foxes' boss Willie Kirk will probably be happiest about his new players: three of his summer recruits, Aimee Palmer, Lena Petermann and Jutta Rantala scored all the goals on their Leicester City debuts in a 4-2 win at Bristol City.\nOn the topic of new faces, it was a Sunday to remember as so many of the players signed over the summer came up big for their new clubs.\nThe tone was set in the first game of the afternoon. Geyse picked up where she left off at Barcelona by straight balling out for Manchester United, running at defences and causing panic among Villa defenders who were struggling to contain her. But it wasn't just the Brazilian international who starred at Villa Park: the Villanesses' new No.1, Dutch international Daphne van Domselaar, made a string of eye-catching saves to keep the visitors frustrated until their late breakthrough.\nIn the West Country, Rantala stole the show for the Foxes after coming on at half-time for the visitors. The Finnish international was instrumental in Leicester's strong second-half showing, scoring four minutes after the restart and adding a second seven minutes from time among a flurry of strong debuts across both teams.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

However, it wasn't just about the goalscorers, as Spurs winger Olga Ahtinen and Chelsea midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken turned in strong WSL debuts as well.\nIt was a similar story in North London, where Liverpool's savvy showing in a 1-0 win was punctuated with key performances from newcomers Miri Taylor (who grabbed the game's only goal) and Austrian midfielder Marie Höbinger, though Arsenal's summer signings were left looking to the next game to impress. The bigger delight, though, was the record WSL crowd in attendance for the Gunners' opener, as 54,115 turned up for Sunday's clash, only for the visitors to take the three points.\nAcross London, Roord put in a vintage performance for Manchester City on her return to the Super League, scoring City's second in a dominant performance against the Irons.\nLikely to be key to the Seagulls in their quest for a top-half finish, Brighton's debuting duo of Vicky Losada and Pauline Bremer both impressed, even if the plaudits went to regulars Elisabeth Terland and Katie Robinson.\nUsually left for later in the first cycle of fixtures, champions Lyon had their first clash with familiar foes, Paris Saint-Germain, on Sunday evening. Having handed a debut to new star striker Tabitha Chawinga, the Parisiennes enjoyed their spell of chances early in the game before Lyon found a gear with which to exploit their opponents, running out 1-0 winners thanks to Eugénie Le Sommer's 20th-minute strike.\nIn Germany, Wolfsburg were put through their paces at the Waldstadion, twice having to come from behind against Eintracht before stamping their dominance on the match thanks in no small part to stunning strikes from Lena Oberdorf and Joelle Wedemeyer. The 4-2 win leaves Wolfsburg in an advantageous position early in the season after champions Bayern had dropped points in their first outing, a 2-2 result vs. Freiburg.\nMeanwhile, in Liga F, Spanish juggernauts Barcelona were put through their paces against a resilient Huelva team, which affirmed the closing margins across the women's football landscape. It took a 92nd minute own goal from Ana Carol to secure Barca's win, though an even later finish by Laia Ballesté made things a little nervous."}

(2:20)\nWe say it every year -- typically, rookies aren't drafted until the middle to late rounds in fantasy basketball.\nYes, every now and then, there's a hyped up player who sneaks into round three (like this year), but most seasons the top rookie won't go until the fourth or fifth round at the earliest.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThis presents a major opportunity for the savvy fantasy manager, who dedicates the early rounds to setting up the foundation of their team while having a certain rookie or two in mind for the middle and late rounds. Find the right rookies, and this can be a winning formula.\nBut who are the rookies to have this season? And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ½ inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}
{"title": "Six players ready to make a big leap in Year 2", "date": "2023-10-02 21:43:05", "text": "After a stellar rookie season, Trail Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe should see plenty of opportunity in a new-look Portland backcourt. (1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind. With the majority of drafted players entering the NBA in their late teens or very early 20s, and many of those players international, the development process from prospect to professional can extend beyond a single season. .\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball.\nAs you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}

The club was clearly aware of their bumbling ways because they cleaned house in 2021. Chris Albright came over to head up soccer operations and they've barely made a wrong move since.\nWhether it's bringing in players from abroad, plucking players from elsewhere in the league, developing those on the roster or deploying their squad in a smart, cohesive system, Cincy have emerged as the class of MLS. Everyone, from Albright, down to manager Pat Noonan, to presumptive league MVP Luciano Acosta, has been nothing short of outstanding and on Saturday they won the Supporters' Shield to show for all their terrific work.\nTwo years ago, Cincy were holding the Wooden Spoon after losing 12 straight to end the season. Now, they are the class of the league and have the first piece of silverware for their trophy case. But what about the 28 teams behind them? Let's rank 'em.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nPrevious ranking: 1\nCincy's superpower is not that they blow teams out of the water. It's that week in, week out, they put together competent performances and rack up points with their consistency. So was it ideal that they got locked into a pretty close game with Toronto? No, but Cincy were the better team and won like they have so often this season. And it is why they are unquestionably deserving Supporters' Shield winners.\nTHE SHIELD IS OURS! pic.twitter.com/84RE1OpkZ4\nPrevious ranking: 2\nThe Crew would have celebrated an impressive win over Philly, but Andre Blake would not give. Those two points lost could be the difference between home-field advantage and not come playoff time.\nPrevious ranking: 4\nThe last time Orlando lost at home was way back on April 22, so it's no surprise they cruised past Montréal at Exploria Stadium. They could clinch that awfully effective home-field advantage for the playoffs as soon as next week.\nPrevious ranking: 3\nThe Union continue to display their depth and adaptiveness. Draws against Dallas and Columbus under heavy rotation were impressive, but they also failed to display the truly excellent top form that has been fleeting this season. If they're going to upend the teams above them in a stacked East, they need to find that extra gear.\nPrevious ranking: 7\nKings of Missouri? Check. Kings of the West? Check. It was a dream week for City, who beat SKC to clinch the top seed in the West, continuing an expansion season beyond anyone's wildest dreams.\nPrevious ranking: 5\nThe return of Sam Surridge was supposed to jumpstart the Nashville attack, but they could barely get him the ball in a scoreless draw with Seattle. The Coyotes have four more chances to put their newly healthy pieces together ahead of the playoffs when they will need a better attack if they want a chance to make a run in a very strong conference. The talent is certainly there, it's just about finding the right form before time runs out.\nPrevious ranking: 6\nLosing the Campeones Cup on penalties was rough, but having Chicho Arango come back to LA in an RSL kit and beat you? That not only stings, but it has them in real danger of losing home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.\nPrevious ranking: 8\nThe Five Stripes got to take the week off and watch teams around them drop points. A leap into the top four of the East and an extra game or two in Atlanta is still in play.\nPrevious ranking: 10\nIt's hardly novel to say that the Sounders desperately need Raúl Ruidíaz at his best to make some hay in the West. That was clear once more after the Peruvian was ruled out of their 0-0 draw with Nashville, but there's still a few weeks left for the 33-year-old to get right for one last playoff run.\nPrevious ranking: 14\nChicho Arango's game-winner in his return to LAFC was the fun story from the big RSL win, but it was Rubio Rubin who made the goal happen with his gorgeous cross. Pablo Mastroeni's team continues to get the job done away from home.\nPrevious ranking: 10\nInter drew NYCFC to make it three results from four matches without Lionel Messi (and they won another when he played sparingly) in a massive statement to those who claim this team is nothing without the Argentine. Unfortunately, their playoff odds keep growing longer so we may have to wait until next season to see the new Inter Miami get a real crack at the league.\nPrevious ranking: 11\nA quick glance at the score would lead you to believe that the Dynamo went a little too hard after winning the U.S. Open Cup and were a little flat against Dallas, but Houston played well and were unlucky not to beat their Texas rivals. Ben Olsen's team is still trending up at the right time.\nPrevious ranking: 13\nThe Revs fans showed up big time to the tune of 37,701 and the team repaid them with a win over Charlotte. Exactly how good this team is now, and will be in the playoffs, remains to be seen after such a volatile summer, but they still own the third seed in the East.\nPrevious ranking: 12\nThe Caps' midweek draw in Colorado doesn't look great at face, but it capped off a seven-match road trip with 11 points so it wasn't too bad. Losing two leads and taking just a point from D.C. at home is tougher to spin as a positive, especially with St. Louis, LAFC and Seattle on tap to close out the season.\nPrevious ranking: 15\nFCD did well to take results from Vancouver and Houston, but after those pair of draws they are now asking themselves an eternal soccer question: is it impressive that a team is managing to so regularly avoid defeat, or concerning that they are struggling to win?

(2:34)\nLONDON -- There was a point on Monday, as a Dominos pizza truck parked up next to Craven Cottage in the build-up to the game, when it became clear Chelsea's woeful form in front of goal was beginning to transform from a persistent narrative to a point of ridicule.\nDominos, in a clear (albeit potentially factual) publicity stunt, had a digital billboard showing how many pizzas they had sold in the five weeks since Chelsea last scored a Premier League goal. It was nearly 10 million and counting. It was humorous -- and for rival fans a bit of schadenfreude -- but more traditional stats about Chelsea's goal drought make for more grim reading.\nComing into Monday's local clash with rivals Fulham, Chelsea had not struck in the league since a 3-0 victory against Premier League strugglers Luton in August, despite the Blues creating chances. Chelsea's five goals were tied for the second-fewest in the Premier League this season (only Burnley had fewer) and their 5.5% shot conversion was the lowest of any team, failing to score with their previous 49 attempts on goal.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Maybe Chelsea have been playing well?\nLike last season under the eventually sacked Graham Potter, Chelsea have remained a team that creates chances but rarely scores. They claimed a narrow 1-0 win over Brighton in the EFL Cup last week. Monday's premier task, then, was to break that deadlock in the Premier League.\nChelsea did that, finally, as part of a much-needed 2-0 victory on Monday that will come as a great relief. Who it came from -- winger Mykhailo Mudryk -- will come as a point of solace, too.\nMudryk arrived at Chelsea as a mark of their enduring appeal last January in a deal that could reach €100 million, but in his ensuing 23 appearances he became the poster boy for the kind of expensive signing that failed to make the grade at Stamford Bridge. Recently, Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino put Mudryk's errors down to confidence and a matter of psychology - an issue he decided to fix by competing against his winger at a game of crossbar challenge.\nWhen pressed in a post-match news conference on why the manager continued to pick Mudryk despite his dry spell, Pochettino said he had earned his chance: \"It is about maturity. It takes time. There was a massive change to the team when he arrived here, and when you arrive to a team it is not easy to settle. When too many young players arrive at a team it is not solid.\"\n\"He showed in his training sessions that he deserved [the chance to play],\" Pochettino added.\nMudryk's moment of redemption came after 18 minutes on Monday. The Ukraine winger flashed a rare look of composure as he chested down a cross from defender Levi Colwill before calmly slotting below Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno for his first goal for Chelsea.\n\"It's all about the design and the strategy that you can provide the young guys, to trust and feel comfortable in themselves, and to feel like home,\" Pochettino said. \"Like everyone, they need to feel like they belong to this club. It's all about [giving them] time and also finding the right people that can help.\"\nIt got even better immediately after the goal. Like the old saying about London buses -- \"You wait for ages and then two come at once\" -- Chelsea scored again seconds later. This time, Cole Palmer pounced on a sloppy pass from Fulham's Tim Ream and slid a pass through to Armando Broja, who just about managed to poke the ball home to complete the quick-fire double. It wasn't as pretty, but it was a goal nonetheless.\n\"For us it's about motivation, even when we were losing and we didn't win at the beginning of the season we were calm and kept the belief,\" Pochettino added. \"Now we have won two games in the last two days, but we always want to keep improving and to build the belief and the confidence because they need to feel that.\"\nMonday's victory does not mark the end of Chelsea's struggles though. There is more work to be done before they can claim to have turned a corner.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Mudryk, despite his well-taken goal, still did not quite shine on the left and was taken off due to a quad injury at half-time. There should also still be concern over the lack of style and personality needed to produce consistent performances.\nNone of this is to mention the issue of the club's league position. Even after this victory, they're still only in 11th place, a point behind Manchester United, and Chelsea's task will only get tougher.\nChelsea have arguably wasted obvious chances to win points at the start of the season, with away defeats to West Ham and Nottingham Forest, as well as an uninspiring 0-0 draw to Bournemouth. The schedule is about to get much tougher: After a trip to Burnley, Chelsea then face a daunting run of against Arsenal (home), Brentford (home), Tottenham (away) Manchester City (home), Newcastle (away), Brighton (home), Manchester United (away).\n\"In football, you always have to be ready for everything,\" Pochettino said. \"This Saturday [against Burnley] is going to be tough also. It is important for the players to have a lift after two victories, but we will keep working.\"\nAll of those worries can live for another day, though. On Monday, Chelsea broke their deadlock and halted a worrying slide in the league. There can be no ridicule in that."}
{"title": "The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Diaz's offside goal", "date": "2023-10-03 04:30:31", "text": "Dale Johnson explains the sequence of events that led to Luis Diaz's goal being incorrectly disallowed vs. Tottenham. (1:41)\nVideo Assistant Referee causes controversy every week in the Premier League, but how are decisions made, and are they correct?\nAfter each weekend, we take a look at the major incidents, to examine and explain the process both in terms of VAR protocol and the Laws of the Game.\n- How VAR decisions have affected every Prem club in 2023-24\n- VAR in the Premier League: Ultimate guide\nIn this week's VAR Review: What went wrong in the VAR room to disallow Luis Diaz's goal for Liverpool at Tottenham Hotspur, Curtis Jones' red card, a missed penalty award for Brentford and the rest of the weekend's events.\nWhat happened: Mohamed Salah played Luis Díaz through on goal in the 34th minute, and the forward produced a superb strike across goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to score. However, the offside flag immediately went up for offside, and the VAR, Darren England, began a check. (watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal, incorrectly communicated.\nVAR review: How do you get a decision both right and disastrously wrong at the same time? It's a question that refs chief Howard Webb and his leadership team will have to answer in the coming days and take steps to ensure an inexcusable mistake of this magnitude can never happen again. It's the biggest error the Premier League has seen.\nEngland and the assistant VAR, Dan Cook, were swiftly both stood down from duties in fixtures on Sunday and Monday, but that kind of action is of no comfort to Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool players. Both are unlikely to be selected in the upcoming matchweeks.\nThe VAR made one very simple but inexplicable error: He lost concentration and got the on-field decision incorrect when completing the check.\nWhen the VAR looked at the position of Diaz, it quickly became apparent that he was very clearly onside. It was checked with the use of the offside lines in the background -- you see proof of this on the VAR feed when the technology operator zooms in to place them.\nAnd this is where it starts to go wrong. England somehow now thinks he is checking a goal, rather than a disallowed goal (he cannot see the overlay shown on TV and in the stadium). If he was confirming an overturn he would lock in the offside lines, but as he now thinks the on-field decision is \"goal,\" there's no prerequisite to do so when the onside is an obvious one.\nEngland cleared the review so quickly and with such confidence he didn't even get the opinion of the assistant VAR. Perhaps that was the issue, it was such a regulation \"onside\" decision that he thought he would wrap it up. And he said \"check complete.\"\nPerhaps the decision was so straightforward that England lost focus and forgot what the on-field decision actually was, because by saying those two words, he's telling the on-field officials their decision is correct. Rather than clearing the goal, he was mistakenly telling the referee the offside call was correct.\nSemi-automated offside technology, which Premier League clubs chose not to introduce this season, would have made no difference in this situation because the error is the communication with the referee. England correctly identified that Diaz was onside.\nPhil Bentham was brought in from rugby league last season as VAR coach specifically to work on communication. Lessons will need to be learned about the process of \"check complete.\"\nWhat happened next came so fast, there was no time to react within protocol. Just two seconds after the VAR has said \"check complete,\" Spurs took the free kick, which creates a cut-off point. Nothing can be reviewed after a restart. (This doesn't apply to penalties awarded for offences before the half-time or final whistle, as play was still active at the time of the offence.)\nSeven seconds later, the VAR team realised their error. Panic set in, but they decided they couldn't go against protocol so they let play continue. But in this situation, where a very serious mistake has been identified within seconds of the restart, football would rather the VAR went against protocol to achieve the fairest outcome for the game. The match should have been stopped.\nNot only did the VAR team fail to react, but also the management team, which could have stepped in and told the VAR team to roll the game back.\nThere was the opportunity to fix it, and it was missed.\nThe VAR audio of the incident will be released, which will at least provide transparency for what happened.\nErrors in process keep happening, even at the very highest level. At the World Cup last year, France had an injury-time equaliser disallowed against Tunisia when the VAR ruled Antoine Griezmann was offside after the kickoff had been taken.\nAnd only a few weeks ago in the Bundesliga, Heidenheim had a penalty ruled out for offside following a foul by Borussia Dortmund's Sébastien Haller. The officials allowed Haller to be substituted, and during that process the VAR realised the offside decision was incorrect. The penalty was reinstated, but Haller, who should have been sent off for pulling back the striker, was no longer on the pitch. He was only shown a yellow card on the bench instead.\nThat doesn't excuse what happened in the Premier League on Saturday.\nQuestions will be asked about the wisdom of allowing England to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, along with Michael Oliver as a team of English officials, to take charge of a league game between Sharjah and Al Ain. In terms of preparation, it's no different than a game in the Europa League and Europa Conference League; the officials were back from the UAE on Friday lunchtime. But it's the optics of travelling to the Middle East to take up an approved, paid job and then coming back to the Premier League and making a huge mistake.\nWebb has been in charge of referees for only nine months, yet he faces the huge problem of public perception that refereeing is getting worse. The stats from the Independent Key Incidents Panel suggest standards are improving, but catastrophic mistakes like that at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium take a hammer to any progress.\nLiverpool issued a statement on Sunday evening insisting the incident has \"undermined sporting integrity,\" and you can understand their point. But the Laws of the Game specifically state that a mistake in the VAR room is no different from a genuine error on the pitch. France appealed to FIFA to try to get their goal back, but were told they had no grounds. Usually, a game would be replayed only if there was a misapplication of the laws, rather than just an incorrect decision.\nThis will now be tough on England and will take some coming back from. Last season he was shadowed by The Guardian and reference was made to how the official seemed mentally exhausted after awarding a controversial late penalty to Manchester City against Fulham. This is going to be even tougher.\nWhat happened: The game was goalless in the 26th minute when Curtis Jones challenged Yves Bissouma for the ball, and committed a foul. Referee Simon Hooper produced a yellow card, but there was a VAR check for a possible red (watch here.)   \nVAR decision: Yellow card upgraded to red.  \nVAR review: Ex-pros and supporters are always split when a player receives a red card when they have played the ball first, but that doesn't excuse the player for how he may catch an opponent. Jones will no doubt feel himself unlucky to get a red card, but the nature of the challenge always meant a VAR intervention was likely.\nAs explained last week in the review for Malo Gusto's red card for Chelsea against Aston Villa, when the replays show that an opponent's leg has effectively been bent by the tackle, that will be seen as evidence of excessive force.\nJones' foot came off the top of the ball and led to him catching Bissouma high on the shin and forcing his leg backward. It's similar in nature to the dismissal of Manchester United midfielder Casemiro against Southampton last season (though that was a clearer red card due to the way he went into the challenge).\nJones was unlucky, but a VAR intervention for a red card was always likely.\nSome supporters complained that England showed Hooper a freeze frame of the point of contact as he walked over to the pitchside monitor, effectively pre-judging the review. Yet as the monitor is specifically there to confirm an overturn (though the referee retains the right to reject the advice of the VAR), a referee is always going to be shown the clearest evidence to support the decision. Hooper will be told as he walks over the screen exactly what he will see and the kind of replays he will be offered. The referee always has the option of requesting additional angles and replay speeds.\nWhat happened: Brentford had a corner in the final moments of the first half. Nicolás Domínguez jumped for the ball with Vitaly Janelt, and the ball appeared to brush the raised arm of the Forest player as it was nodded on. When the ball bounced inside the area, it was then touched by the hand of Willy Boly.\nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: After the decision to penalise Wolves' João Gomes for his raised arm at Luton Town last weekend, you could understand questions over the first handball by Domínguez. His arm was high, and it was hit by the ball. He escapes because it hit him at point-blank range and the arm position was justified when jumping.\nBoly had his arm by his side, so it would need to be a deliberate handball, and while there was a movement, it appeared to be natural rather than specific to push the ball away.\nWhat happened: Yoane Wissa closed down Forest goalkeeper Matt Turner following a back-pass by Murillo. The Brentford striker got a toe to the ball and pushed it toward goal, and was then caught by Turner as the keeper tried to make the clearance. A defender cleared the ball before it crossed the line.  \nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: This definitely should have been a penalty, and that the error was made by Michael Oliver, who was in the UAE with Darren England, only adds to the issues facing PGMOL this week.\nWissa gets to the ball first and is kicked by the goalkeeper. Perhaps it was Wissa's immediate reaction to get up and play on, rather than appealing for the foul, which threw Oliver. Either way, it was a mistake not to intervene.\nWhat happened: Ollie Watkins doubled Aston Villa's lead in the 21st minute when finishing into the corner. It looked initially as though goalkeeper Jason Steele had let a weak shot past him into the corner of the net, but was he impacted by Nicolò Zaniolo in an offside position in front of him? (watch here)\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\nVAR review: It provides a good comparison with an incident from a month ago, when Manchester City saw a goal allowed to stand when Manuel Akanji was in front of Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno. PGMOL admitted that goal should have been ruled out by the VAR, and on the face of it, this is the same. Then last week Manchester United had a goal ruled out by the VAR when Rasmus Højlund was in front of Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford on Jonny Evans' header. So what's the difference, and why wasn't Villa's goal ruled out?\nThe key difference between Akanji and Zaniolo are the actions of the players in front of the goalkeeper. Akanji made an obvious action to play and/or evade the ball on its way to goal, which had to affect the goalkeeper's decision-making. However, Zaniolo makes absolutely no movement at all -- and this makes any impact on the keeper far more difficult to evaluate.\nThe VAR has decided that he couldn't be certain there was any impact on Steele in the Brighton goal. It's certainly a situation that will split opinion.\nThe disallowed Man United goal was slightly different in interpretation, as Højlund was in direct contact with the Burnley goalkeeper so he had to be considered to be having an impact.\nWe can also look at Crystal Palace's goal at Old Trafford on Saturday. Although there were two players in an offside position in front of goal, they were not impacting André Onana.\nWhat happened: Villa got a third goal in the 26th minute when Pervis Estupiñán diverted a shot from Moussa Diaby into his own net. However, Solly March was adamant he was fouled in the buildup to the goal, which was checked by the VAR (watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal stands. \nVAR review: There's no doubt that March was fouled by Douglas Luiz, who effectively fell into the Brighton player and brought him down. That means the only judgement for the VAR is on the attacking phase: Did the incident happen too far back in the move for it have a material impact?\nIt's a tough call, because you could judge winning the ball to be crucial to a goal whenever it happens in the buildup. But, in the Premier League, at least, there has been a desire not to look too far back to disallow goals for a foul.\nLast season, 10 goals were disallowed because a foul in the leadup to a goal. From Phil Foden's goal against Liverpool for a foul by Erling Haaland, to Leandro Trossard's strike for Ben White holding on to the arm of Leicester City goalkeeper Danny Ward. But in each case, the goal came very quickly after the incident.\nAfter March is fouled there is another 50-50 challenge for the ball, so Villa didn't achieve possession directly as a result of the foul. There are then several passes over 15 seconds before Diaby has a first shot on goal, which was saved by Steele, before his second effort went in off Estupiñán.\nIt's a tricky judgement call on the attacking phase, but it's consistent in the application we've seen in English football.\nWhat happened: Brighton & Hove Albion got a goal back in the 50th minute through Ansu Fati. The goal came after João Pedro had go to the goal-line and attempted a cut back, and eventually got the ball to a teammate at the second attempt. The VAR began a very lengthy check on the goal. (Watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\nVAR review: It took an inordinate amount of time for what seemed like a pretty straightforward VAR check, which looked at two possible situations.\nIn total, the review took 2½ minutes. First, there was a question of the ball being out of play when Pedro controlled it, but it soon became clear the whole of the ball hadn't crossed the goal-line. Second, whether a possible offside against goal scorer Ansu, which seemed to go on and on.\nIt doesn't matter that Pedro's touch sends the ball backwards, the direction the ball goes doesn't matter -- only the position of the attacking player who receives the ball. But the situation is complicated slightly as John McGinn has run off the pitch in trying to challenge Pedro -- it gives the immediate impression that Ansu has to be offside. But in law, McGinn is considered to be on the goal-line, which makes goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez the second defensive player, and the one who creates the offside line.\nThe VAR seemed to spend a long time trying to determine the correct frame for the kick-point by Pedro, but even during this process, it seemed very evident from the naked eye that Ansu was being played onside by the heel of Martinez. The VAR needs to apply the lines to prove this, of course, but it took far too long for what was essentially a straightforward situation.\n\nWhat happened: Manchester United were already trailing 1-0 to Crystal Palace in the 59th minute and looking for a way back into the game. Bruno Fernandes lifted a ball into the box aimed for Marcus Rashford, and the ball hit the hand of Joel Ward before it could get to the striker. United players appealed for a penalty, but referee Chris Kavanagh said no.    \nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: While Ward did check over his shoulder for the flight of the ball, there's no way this could be considered deliberate after the ball flicked off his hand. Ward also had his back to the ball when it hit him, and his arm was close to his body in an expected position.\nPoor defending to misread the flight, but not a handball offence.\nWhat happened: Palace had a handball appeal of their own in the 90th minute when the ball hit the arm of Sofyan Amrabat. Did Palace have any grounds for a spot kick?\nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: As with Ward, Amrabat had his arm close to his body, so there was no chance that the VAR, Peter Bankes, would advise a penalty kick.\nAmrabat also had the ball hit onto him at close proximity by Jairo Riedewald.\nWhat happened: Newcastle United were awarded a penalty in the 75th minute when Ameen Al Dakhil brought down Anthony Gordon. The Burnley defender appealed against the decision, and there was an automatic check made by the VAR, Jarred Gillett.\nVAR decision: Penalty stands, scored by Alexander Isak. \nVAR review: A very simple and quick check, despite Al Dakhil's claims that he had got to the ball. It was clear from the angle behind the play that it was a foul, and referee Thomas Bramall had made the correct decision.\nSome parts of this article include information provided by the Premier League and PGMOL."}

(1:27)\nLove it or loathe it, VAR is now an established part of the modern game. When it was introduced back in 2017 we were all lulled into a false sense of security: there would be no more controversy and every decision would be correct.\nIt's not quite worked out like that as human error cannot be eliminated.\nFrom wrongly disallowed goals, to penalties scored after full-time, VAR is never far from the headlines.\nVAR has gone to the very top of the game, having an influence on the results of World Cup and Champions League finals. Countless matches in competitions all over the world have been either aided or -- depending on your own opinion of the controversial officiating tool -- blighted by its involvement.\nIt's worth noting that by \"wild moments\" we're not talking about common contentious fouls and free kicks, nor are we raking back through all the countless times players have been adjudged to be fractionally offside at an atomic level. Instead we focus on some of the notable occurrences when VAR intervention has led truly baffling scenes to break out during a football match.\n- How VAR has affected every Premier League club\n- VAR in the Premier League: The ultimate guide\n- Don't have ESPN? Get instant access\nAntoine Griezmann thought he had scored a dramatic equaliser for France in the 98th minute, but there was a VAR review for offside. But it turned out to be an illegal review.\nVideo evidence showed that referee Matthew Conger had restarted the match, before blowing the final whistle. That meant that by VAR protocol it wasn't possible to review the offside offence. The goal was disallowed and France lost 1-0 to a Tunisia side that headed out of the tournament in the group stage.\nFrance protested against the disallowed goal, but FIFA rejected that appeal. Luckily Les Bleus were already through to the round of 16 and the incident made no difference to their position on top of Group D.\nAn almighty error as the VAR, Darren England, somehow messed up the onfield decision and thought he was checking a goal, when he was in fact checking a disallowed goal.\nEngland worked out that Liverpool forward Luis Díaz was onside, and told the match referee \"check complete.\" But this meant he was saying the on-field decision was correct ... when the on-field decision was offside.\nThe game was 0-0 at the time, and Spurs then scored a minute later and went on to win 2-1.\n- The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Diaz's offside goal\nThe game in September 2022 was 2-2 in added time when Juventus thought they had snatched all three points when substitute Arkadiusz Milik headed home, but the goal was disallowed following a VAR review for offside.\nLeonardo Bonucci was judged to be distracting the goalkeeper as Milik's effort flew towards goal.\nBut the VAR had missed a Salernitana player close to the corner flag who was playing the whole Juventus attack onside. Juve had two players sent off as they protested.\nThe incident led to Serie A bringing in semi-automated offside technology in the middle of the season.\nIn September 2023, Heidenheim were trailing 2-1 at Dortmund in the 76th minute when Jan-Niklas Beste moved into the area and was pulled back by Sébastien Haller. The referee pointed to the penalty spot, but was told by the VAR that Beste was offside. The penalty was cancelled.\nDortmund then decided to substitute Haller, during which time the VAR realised he had made an error in the offside review. There had been a \"deliberate play\" of the ball by Haller, which reset the phase and meant Beste was actually onside.\nThe referee was sent to the pitchside monitor and change the decision to a penalty. Haller should have been sent off for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, but the officials had allowed him to be taken off. The Dortmund player was only booked on the bench, but Heidenheim should have been playing against 10 men. At least they got their penalty ... eventually. It was scored and the game ended 2-2.\nHistory was made in the Bundesliga in April 2018 when Mainz were awarded a penalty during half-time of their match against Freiburg. The referee had signalled the end of the first half and sent the players to their dressing rooms after Mainz had a penalty appeal turned down when right-back Daniel Brosinski's cross deflected off Freiburg centre-back Marc-Oliver Kempf's hand and was saved by goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow.\nAs the players headed for the locker rooms, referee Guido Winkmann ran over to the other side of the pitch to watch the replay on a monitor. He awarded the hosts a penalty, recalling the entire Freiburg side and the handful of Mainz players who had left the pitch.\nSix minutes after the half-time whistle had blown, Pablo de Blasis scored the penalty to put Mainz 1-0 up. He added a second to seal a 2-0 win, though only after the start of the second half was delayed as ground staff had to clear reams of toilet roll thrown on to the pitch by irate Freiburg fans during the break.\nOne of the most costly VAR fails ever came during the A-League Grand Final in May 2018, when a total catastrophe befell the system during Australia's biggest game of the season.\nNine minutes into the title decider, the VAR camera feed went offline for roughly 30 seconds, during which Melbourne Victory managed to score a goal against Newcastle Jets. Television replays showed that the goal was clearly offside, but the VAR system could not be deployed to rectify the situation. Alas, by the time the technical staff managed to get the VAR camera back online the game had resumed and it was too late to review the phase of play in question so the Victory goal was allowed to stand.\nKosta Barbarouses' decisive strike proved to be the only goal in a game which Victory fans still refer to as \"the heist in the Hunter\" -- a reference to one of the McDonald Jones Stadium's former names.\nTottenham once again found themselves on the wrong end of a chaotic VAR episode then they played host to Watford on New Year's Day of 2019. Trailing 0-1 since the sixth minute of the match following Abdoulaye Doucoure's opener, Spurs finally looked to have broken through the Hornets' blockade in the 86th minute when Dele Alli sprang to score a late equaliser. However, celebrations were muted while the goal was checked by VAR for a possible handball by Alli in the build-up.\nWith most people inside the stadium already at a loss as to what was going on, the confusion was ramped up several notches when Alli's goal was simultaneously given by the referee AND declared to have been disallowed by a message on the big screens around the ground. The game then resumed for its final few minutes, and full-time came with most in attendance utterly clueless as to what the final score was (1-1).\nSPAL had every right to feel aggrieved in February 2019 when they saw what might have been a winning goal against Fiorentina chalked off by VAR. The hosts thought midfielder Mattia Valoti had put them 2-1 up against La Viola in the 77th minute, only for referee Luca Pairetto to intervene and rather sour the moment. Attention was drawn to a foul made at the opposite end of the pitch in a previous phase of play in which Fiorentina forward Federico Chiesa was felled in the SPAL penalty box several minutes earlier.\nAs such, following a VAR review, the referee cancelled out SPAL's goal and instead awarded a penalty to Fiorentina, which Jordan Veretout dispatched to put the away side 2-1 up in a remarkable turnaround. Fiorentina went on to win the match 4-1 thanks to additional goals from Giovanni Simeone and Gerson scored in the final 10 minutes, leaving SPAL to wonder what might have been.\nMEDIA RELEASE:Temporary dispensation: no cautions for goalkeeper encroachment during Kicks from the Penalty Mark at the @FIFAWWC 2019.➡️ https://t.co/8Lu7hW207x pic.twitter.com/udqs1B1ODb\nAs if major international tournaments aren't stressful enough, football's lawmakers the International Football Association Board (IFAB) decided to add an extra layer of pressure to the 2019 Women's World Cup by changing the rules regarding penalties halfway through the competition. The tournament had seen several goalkeepers shown yellow cards while facing penalty kicks after being flagged by VAR for moving off their line a fraction too early, resulting in the kicks being retaken. After a succession of controversial incidents during the group stage, the IFAB approved an emergency request from FIFA to make a \"temporary dispensation\" to the law, thus granting 'keepers a reprieve of sorts.\nAs such, the temporary dispensation removed the need for referees to issue mandatory yellow cards for encroachment on the basis that the presence of VAR alone should be enough to deter keepers from jumping the gun -- apart from during penalty shootouts, when the original law would still apply. Clear as day, then.\nThis is incredible. In added time in Bolivia, referee goes to sidelines to make decision to award Always Ready against Bolívar. Signals decision to award penalty using VAR signal. The Bolivian league doesn't have VAR technology. The penalty was not scored.pic.twitter.com/dKMoEHcHXk\nFootage of entire incident (via @gbobadi), showing the chaotic seasons and subsequently missed penalty. But check out how far the Bolívar defender has run into the box before penalty is taken.pic.twitter.com/ccf6bBfni4\nAlways Ready were trailing 1-0 as they entered the final few seconds of added time in their game against Bolivar in August 2019. In a desperate attempt to score an equaliser, they appealed to referee Raul Orosco for a penalty following an aerial clash inside the area. Orosco went over to the sidelines to watch a replay of the incident. Content with what he'd seen on the monitor, the official then returned to the pitch to award the penalty while making the requisite \"VAR\" hand gesture. However, it was at this point it dawned on Orosco that VAR hadn't actually been implemented in the Bolivian Primera Division and so he tried to transform his \"TV screen\" signal into a hurried point toward his earpiece instead.\nThe awarding of the penalty sparked chaos as both sets of players and coaching staff argued on the field for a full 10 minutes, with many repeating the \"VAR\" gesture as they demanded answers. Eventually, sufficient order was restored to allow Always Ready to finally take their controversial spot kick, which hit the post.\nWith minutes to go before half-time in the German second-tier clash between Holstein Kiel and VfL Bochum in October 2019, midfielder Michael Eberwein was busy limbering up with the rest of the Kiel subs behind his side's goal when he made the fatal error of stopping a wayward shot before the ball had gone all the way off the pitch. VAR spotted that this innocent error was in direct contravention of the laws of the game governing substitutes interfering with play, and asked the referee to come over to consult the footage. Sure enough, a penalty was awarded to Bochum and Eberwein was shown a yellow card.\nBochum striker Silvere Ganvoula M'boussy, whose shot off target had sparked the furore, stepped up to convert the penalty. Just to make matters worse, Eberwein had yet to make his debut for Kiel at the time, meaning that he'd also managed to concede a spot kick without making a single appearance for the club. As yet another bitter digestif for Kiel, the German FA (DFB) consulted with the IFAB on the decision and were told that, whilst the referee should have initially given the penalty, the incident did not qualify as an \"exceptional circumstance\" which justified an intervention by VAR, meaning the spot kick really should not have been awarded.\nSpurs (them again) found themselves subjected to a decision so ludicrous that it actually helped bring about a change in the way the Premier League interpreted the law. After falling into line with the rest of Europe and adopting a stricter application of handball, the opening weeks of the 2020-21 Premier League season had already been littered with controversial decisions. Then came the case of Eric Dier.\nSpurs were leading by a single Lucas Moura goal against Newcastle as the September fixture entered added time, only for the visitors to be gifted the very softest of penalties when Dier leapt for a header alongside Andy Carroll. The Newcastle striker won the duel and nudged the ball innocuously against the Spurs defender's flailing arm while he had his back turned.\nReferee Peter Bankes initially missed the non-incident but VAR was on hand to draw his attention to an infringement of the newly implemented (and much-maligned) handball law stating that any ball-to-hand contact in the area might be penalised regardless of whether said contact is intentional or otherwise. Clauses seven and eight of the law were invoked as Dier's \"hand/arm was above/beyond his shoulder level.\"\nCallum Wilson scored his penalty to rescue an unlikely point for Newcastle. However, with frustrations from all quarters already high, the outcry over the decision to punish Dier caused the Premier League to roll back its change and apply a far more liberal interpretation of handball inside the penalty area.\nThe IFAB then tweaked the law the following March, some six months later. The IFAB's new incarnation of the rule dictated that handballs would only be given when the arm is completely away for the body and could not be justifiable by the way the player is moving, for instance jumping like Dier was in order for a foul to be given -- which is actually remarkably similar to the way the law worked before they changed it in the first place.\nIn a truly baffling turn of events, Manchester United strayed even beyond the constraints of \"Fergie Time\" to score their late winner against Brighton in the Premier League back in September 2020.\nThe game looked to be over and done when Solly March scored a 95th-minute equaliser for the Seagulls to make the score 2-2 at the Amex Stadium. However, there was still time for one last twist when United were awarded a penalty AFTER the full-time whistle had sounded. Confusion reigned as referee Chris Kavanagh blew for full-time following a late United corner, only for VAR to ask the official to review a replay of the action in the box. In doing so, Kavanagh noticed an unfortunate handball from Brighton striker Neal Maupay and awarded a penalty to United.\nBruno Fernandes kept his composure to score from the spot and snatch a ludicrous, unprecedented victory for United in the 10th minute of added time of a match that had already been ended once.\nA prime example of VAR being applied too fastidiously came during a game between Crystal Palace and Leeds at Selhurst Park in November 2020. In fine form at the time, Patrick Bamford appeared to have found the net for Leeds once again when he broke the Palace line to score an equaliser for his side with 17 minutes played.\nPatrick Bramford offside because of the change in the handball law. Because you can now pay the ball with the top part of your arm the outstretched arm played him offside. This was onside last season to the armpit. #CRYLEE pic.twitter.com/EezUHdxIYQ\nHowever, the goal was ruled out when VAR deemed Bamford had been offside in the build-up because the striker pointed where he wanted the ball played despite the rest of his body being onside at the time the pass was played. Strictly speaking the decision was correct to the letter of the law as Bamford had pointed using a portion of his arm that he could legally score a goal with, but still...\nPalace went on to win the game 4-1.\n😯 𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗥𝗘𝗜́𝗕𝗟𝗘: hinchas de Gremio invadieron el campo de juego y destrozaron la cabina del VAR💥 Fue después de perder por 3-1 contra Palmeiras por el Brasileirao: el equipo está 19° y en zona de descenso pic.twitter.com/IWaNA4YCal\nLanguishing near the bottom of the table and threatened by relegation, Gremio fans thought their team had hauled their way back into a game against Palmeiras in October 2021 when a potentially crucial equaliser made it 2-2. The swell of optimism quickly gave way to despair when a VAR review disallowed the goal and Gremio went on to slump to a 3-1 defeat in front of their own supporters.\nIt all proved too much for some fans, who decided to rush on to the pitch and take out their frustrations on the technical equipment that had so harshly robbed them.\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Brazil goalkeeper Alisson became the first player to be shown two red cards in the same game and still complete the full match after being spared twice by the VAR. The Liverpool shot-stopper was shown his first red card for a high boot in the 25th minute and then another in stoppage time for knocking striker Ayrton Preciado to the ground while attempting to punch the ball clear.\nHowever, both decisions were overturned after the referee consulted VAR, thus allowing Alisson to finish the game despite being \"sent off\" twice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he was more than happy to sing the praises of the video replay system.\n\"I think this was the first time this has happened in the history of football,\" Alisson said after the match. \"I think that I acted properly in the moves and I think my teammates helped me a lot, they were incisive in their complaints to the referee. This shows once again the importance of using VAR in football. I am happy with the VAR, if it wasn't for the VAR we'd have been punished unfairly.\"\nTempers flared in Serie A last month when mid-table Torino played host to title-chasing Inter Milan at the Stadio Olimpico in Piedmont. Without a win in eight games, the home side defied expectations when Brazilian defender Bremer propelled them in front with an early opener after just 12 minutes. The Granata then carved out a good chance to put themselves further ahead when forward Andrea Belotti found himself clean through on goal only to be upended by the outstretched limb of Inter centre-back Andrea Ranocchia inside the penalty area.\nUnderstandably, Torino appealed in unison only for referee Marco Guida to instruct Belotti to get to his feet. Then, following a brief consultation with VAR official Davide Massa via his headset, Guida was content to let play continue without so much as a pitchside review. In the meanwhile, replays had revealed that Ranocchia had indeed clearly knocked the goal-bound Belotti off his feet before then playing the ball. The game finished 1-1 thanks to a dramatic 93rd-minute equaliser for Inter scored by Alexis Sanchez which, naturally, didn't do anything to calm the incandescent ire of Torino coach Ivan Juric.\n\"It was a clear penalty and nobody understands why it wasn't awarded. I am sure they will try to explain it, but they can't,\" Juric fumed after the final whistle. \"It completely ruined the game, as we would've been 2-0 up.\"\nThe reaction was as we get in the PL.Torino coach: \"It's the latest situation of many when we were penalised. This one is completely inexplicable. It was a clear penalty and nobody understands why it wasn't awarded. I am sure they will try to explain it, but they can't.\" pic.twitter.com/TlK2GhXSz3\nThe Italian press were equally flabbergasted with Tuttosport even awarding referee Guida 0/10 for his performance and branding the turn of events in Turin as a \"scandal.\" Such was the controversy surrounding the errant penalty decision that Serie A themselves stepped in and attempted to diffuse the situation by allowing the Italian Referees' Association (AIA) to release the audio log of the chat between Guida and his VAR official, Massa. \"Ball! Ball! Yes, he got the ball, carry on,\" was the message delivered directly into the ear of the referee.\nThe AIA then proceeded to lay blame squarely at Massa's feet for making what they called a \"serious error,\" with refereeing designator Gianluca Rocchi stating that Massa \"should have looked more carefully at the footage\" before advising Guida to allow play to continue.\nAmid calls for Guida to be banned and/or dropped as a Serie A ref altogether over the incident, Rocchi made sure to add that the AIA wouldn't be prepared to \"lose such a good referee over [the error].\" Still, neither Guida nor Massa have been assigned to officiate a domestic match since the Torino-Inter VAR farce as the fallout continues to simmer away.\nESPN's Dale Johnson contributed to this report"}

(1:56)\nLet the 2023 MLB playoffs begin!\nStarting with this week's wild-card series (beginning Tuesday at 3 p.m. ET on ABC), it's sure to be another thrilling October of postseason baseball. We've got you covered with everything you need to know, from the first pitch of the playoffs to the final out of the World Series.\nWill the favored Atlanta Braves roll through the National League, or will one of the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers or Milwaukee Brewers be the NL's last team standing? Can the Baltimore Orioles turn a 100-plus-win season into a World Series berth, or will we see a deep run from the Texas Rangers or defending champion Houston Astros?\nMLB experts Bradford Doolittle, Alden Gonzalez and David Schoenfield get you ready for it all with odds for every round, a predicted date of each team's last game and a name to watch for all 12 World Series hopefuls.\nNote: World Series and matchup odds come from Doolittle's formula using power ratings as the basis for 10,000 simulations to determine the most likely outcomes.\nJump to a team:\nTOR | TEX | TB | MIN | HOU | BAL\nARI  | MIA | PHI | MIL | LAD | ATL\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers or Rays (49.0% chance of reaching ALCS)\nWorld Series odds: 11.5% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista. Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- Schoenfield\nTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nKurkjian: From raw to really, really good »\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more »\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together (preferably with Bautista) but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- Doolittle\n\nHouston Astros\nNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champs\nALDS opponent: Twins or Blue Jays (53.6% chance of reaching ALCS)\nWorld Series odds: 12.0% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield \nReady for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000. OK, who am I kidding? You're not rooting for the Astros unless you live in Houston. -- Schoenfield\nKnowing what we know now, which teams should have done more, less -- or exactly the same?\n Judging all 30 clubs one month later »\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Remember '21. If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- Doolittle\n\nMinnesota Twins\nNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champs\nFirst opponent: Blue Jays (57.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.8% | Caesars odds: +2000\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins get healthy enough? Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis, and manager Rocco Baldelli said he'll play in the playoffs \"but won't be 100%.\" Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue, and his status is uncertain. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. They'll need these players back and producing to avoid adding another chapter to Minnesota's lengthy streak of postseason disappointments. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity will come this postseason. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros and maybe even the Rays. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. Your fondest memories of the Blue Jays remain Dave Stieb and George Bell, not Kevin Gausman and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. But the Twins ... the Twins have lost an unfathomable 18 consecutive playoff games going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins win a series (or four). Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\nCheck out the highlights from some of MLB's best young stars as they head into the postseason, including Ronald Acuna Jr., Adley Rutschman and Corbin Carroll.\n\nTampa Bay Rays\nNo. 4 seed | 99-63 | AL first wild card\nWild-card opponent: Rangers (58.0% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.3% | Caesars odds: +1200\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 13\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Can the offense get hot at the right time? When the Rays had that amazing start, the offense was on fire and led the majors in runs scored through the end of May. It has been solid since then, but nowhere near as dominant. With Wander Franco on administrative leave, Brandon Lowe out with a patella fracture and Luke Raley questionable due to a cervical strain, they're basically down to Josh Lowe from the left side of the plate (and light-hitting switch hitter Taylor Walls). That means they're going to face a lot of nasty righty relievers that they'll have to beat late in games. -- Schoenfield\nEight teams will take the field, but only four will move on. Watch every wild-card series matchup from Tuesday through Thursday on ESPN and ABC.\nTuesday's schedule:\nTEX-TB: 3 p.m. ET on ABC\nTOR-MIN: 4:30 p.m. ET on ESPN\nARI-MIL 7 p.m. ET on ESPN2\nMIA-PHI 8 p.m. on ESPN\nReady for his October closeup: There are few things we can all agree on these days, but this seems to be one of them: Randy Arozarena loves the big stage. We saw it during the 2020 postseason, a dominant showing before he had even registered 50 major league games. We saw it during this year's World Baseball Classic, with his cowboy boots and sporadic autograph sessions and seemingly endless array of clutch hits. We saw it four months later, when he nearly took down Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to win the Home Run Derby. And we'll probably see it again in October, for a Rays team that desperately needs his production with its starting rotation decimated by injuries and Wander Franco unavailable. Everyone will be looking at Randy Arozarena -- just the way he likes it. -- Gonzalez \nWhy you should root for them: It has been yet another remarkable \"How do they do it?\" season from the Rays. They lost key starting pitchers throughout the season -- Jeffrey Springs in April, Drew Rasmussen in May and Shane McClanahan in early August -- and yet remained in the hunt for the division title in the majors' toughest division until the final weekend. As always, they're aggressive on the bases and have a bunch of dominant relievers you've probably never heard of (check out the stats for one-time cast-offs Robert Stephenson and Shawn Armstrong). If you want to root for the AL team that does the most with the least amount of money, the Rays are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Out-homer them. It's really that simple, and you might say that about every other club that will confront Atlanta. But it's different when we're talking about the Rays because they might be better equipped to do it than anybody. The Rays ranked fifth in homer percentage, though they relied on homers for just 41% of their scoring, as opposed to a historic 52% for the Braves. Like Minnesota, the Rays' staff dominates the strike zone, ranking just behind the Twins in strikeout rate and just ahead of them in walk rate. But what separates the Rays is that they also ranked sixth in homers allowed percentage (third on the road, which filters out some of the park effects). No one has a better profile for winning a series against Atlanta decided by longball prowess. -- Doolittle\n\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Rays (42.0% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.2% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 5\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman the other night in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi has yet to go more than five innings while slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\n\nToronto Blue Jays\nNo. 6 seed | 89-73 | AL third wild card\nWild-card opponent: Twins (42.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.7% | Caesars odds: +1800\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. When Guerrero and Bichette reached the majors in 2019 -- Guerrero at 20 years old and Bichette at 21 -- and soon established themselves as two of the top young players in the game, it appeared all the Jays had to do was build around the two future stars. That stardom has been a little hit-and-miss for both players, however, and the Jays have yet to win a playoff game with these two. The Blue Jays have the starting rotation to go all the way, but the offense has been middle-of-the-pack all season. They need Guerrero and Bichette to get hot together. -- Schoenfield\nWe created a new set of accolades to honor the best of the regular season before October arrives.\n Passan's 2023 awards »\nReady for his October closeup: Jose Berrios was a shell of himself last year, leading the American League in earned runs allowed and not pitching in the series when the Blue Jays got knocked out by the Seattle Mariners in two wild-card games. He has since bounced back in dramatic fashion, posting a 3.65 ERA in 189⅔ innings. There are questions about the Blue Jays' underperforming offense heading into the postseason, but their rotation -- fronted by Kevin Gausman -- stands as a major strength. Berrios' resurgence has been a major part of that. And he'll finally get to show why the Blue Jays gave up two high-end prospects to acquire him from the Twins in the summer of 2021, then signed him to a $131 million extension the following offseason. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: When the Blue Jays are clicking, they're a really fun team to watch. No, Guerrero hasn't repeated his monster 2021 season, but he's still one of the biggest names in the sport. The defense, with Kevin Kiermaier and Daulton Varsho in the outfield and Matt Chapman at third, is often spectacular and leads the majors in defensive runs saved. Gausman is a legit No. 1 starter with that nasty, unhittable splitter. And it has been 30 years since they were last in a World Series, when Joe Carter touched 'em all. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Out-defend them. The Toronto pitching staff didn't do a great job of keeping the ball in the park this season and against the Braves; that's a less-than-ideal trait. Last we checked, it's hard to field a ball that flies over the fence, so our recipe here for Toronto has the obvious prerequisite that it has to have some good fortune in the homer-per-fly-ball category. But if that happens, the Blue Jays have a whopping advantage over the Braves in terms of the leading defensive metrics. In particular, their outfield can flat pick it, with the Jays more than doubling the defensive runs saved total of any other outfield. So if the Braves aren't quite barreling it up on their power swings, the abilities of Varsho and Kiermaier to chase everything down could tip a close series. -- Doolittle\n\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies or Marlins (65.4% chance of reaching NLCS)\nWorld Series odds: 22.4% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: Brewers or D-backs (63.1% chance of reaching NLCS)\nWorld Series odds: 18.6% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\nNo. 3 seed | 92-70 | NL Central champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (61.7% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 4.7% | Caesars odds: +1800\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 14\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The Brewers must get leads to the bullpen, which ranks first in the majors in win probability added (by a large margin). That's basically a proxy for \"clutch\" when it comes to reliever performance and that's what the pen has been all season in leading the Brewers to an excellent record in both one-run and extra-inning games. Closer Devin Williams throws his changeup more than 50% of the time and it's so good it has a nickname: The Airbender. Batters are hitting .098 against it. Joel Payamps has been the key setup guy while Hoby Milner and Bryse Wilson have been excellent as well -- and keep an eye on flame-throwing rookie Abner Uribe, who didn't come up until July but has pitched himself into a high-leverage role. --Schoenfield\nWhich World Series contenders must win now -- or else?\n Bradford Doolittle »\nReady for his October closeup: William Contreras never got much of a chance on star-studded Braves teams over these past few years, seeing a combined 10 postseason plate appearances in 2021 and 2022. Then the Brewers acquired him as part of the three-team trade that sent Sean Murphy to Atlanta in December 2022, and now Contreras -- Willson's younger brother -- stands at the center of a Brewers offense that needs more punch to back up its dynamic pitching staff. Contreras, Christian Yelich and the recently acquired Mark Canha are the only Brewers regulars with an adjusted OPS at least 10% above league average. Contreras needs to produce from the No. 2 spot and handle the rigors of a demanding position. This year, he proved he is up to the task. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Tired of the Braves and Dodgers? Can't find yourself rooting for a team from Philly? Then the scrappy, small-market Brewers are for you! Plus, they've never won a World Series, making it only once, way back in 1982 when they lost to the Cardinals in seven games. This is their fifth playoff trip in six seasons so they've been a consistent contender, with some playoff heartbreak along the way -- a Game 7 loss to the Dodgers in the 2018 NLCS, the late blown lead in the 2019 wild-card game. They deserve your playoff love. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Keep them off the scoreboard. The Brewers are a complete package on the run-prevention side of the game. They have a terrific rotation that looks even better in the postseason format because of their unmatched big three of Corbin Burnes, Brandon Woodruff and Freddy Peralta. They have an elite end-of-game hammer in Williams, and no one is better at bridging the gap between the starters and the closer than Craig Counsell. On top of all that, the Brewers are an elite defensive team that can win games by taking hits away in the infield and outfield alike. If the offense produces anything in October, the Brewers are going to be a team nobody wants to face. Even the Braves. -- Doolittle\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nWild-card opponent: Marlins (64.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.2% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\n\nNo. 5 seed | 84-77 | NL second wild card\nWild-card opponent: Phillies (35.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 1.2% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The rotation will have to absolutely crush it, because the Marlins were last in the NL in runs and the bullpen has been shaky at times. The Marlins are here because they excelled in one-run games (the best record in the majors), so if they can translate that success to the lower-scoring environment of playoff baseball, maybe they can surprise. With Sandy Alcantara injured, Jesus Luzardo is the No. 1 starter and when he's on, he's very tough: He's tied for second (behind only Blake Snell) for the most starts this season allowing no more than one run. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: It seems as if we've been waiting a little too long for Jazz Chisholm Jr. to emerge as a superstar, but perhaps baseball's biggest stage will bring that out of him. We know it's in there. Chisholm, 25, can be lightning in a bottle for this young, scrappy Marlins team, able to impact games with his bat and his legs and his glove (he has played a very nice center field despite never playing there before this season). Chisholm has been good but not great offensively since returning from an oblique strain in late July, but he has shown flashes of brilliance. He probably has more in him. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: If you like October weirdness, then the Marlins are your team. After all, they have a chance now for a third World Series -- even though they've never won a division title and made the playoffs in a full season just three times. Indeed, this rotation is reminiscent of the 2003 world championship group, a young staff featuring Josh Beckett, Dontrelle Willis, Carl Pavano and Brad Penny, all 27 or younger. Luzardo, Braxton Garrett, Eury Perez and Edward Cabrera are all 25 or younger. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Keep it close! The Marlins are in the postseason because they have dominated one-run games, pure and simple. They are 20 games over .500 (33-13) in one-run contests and because of that, a team with a run profile that should land them in the mid-70s in the win column is instead in the mid-80s. Of course, \"keeping it close\" isn't really a strategy. So as we look at the chances of a team that is hard to explain, we can't say that the Marlins could blow through the Braves and the rest of the bracket because they won a lot of close games. We can say that if they do wind up in the World Series, the one-run success -- wherever it sprang from -- will have held up. -- Doolittle\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nWild-card opponent: Brewers (38.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 1.5% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly. The D-backs' two co-aces could pitch them into the NLDS, but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. Carroll is certainly the star attraction but he's not alone: rookie catcher Gabriel Moreno is going to be another cornerstone player with his defense -- check out his arm -- and improving bat. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}

(0:38)\nEAST RUTHERFORD, NJ. -- The Seattle Seahawks' defense shined as they beat the New York Giants 24-3 at MetLife Stadium on Monday night. Giants QB Daniel Jones turned the ball over three times and was sacked 10 times.\nIt wasn't all great for the Seahawks as safety Jamal Adams was lost early in the first quarter after being evaluated for a concussion. It was his first game back since he suffered a torn left quad tendon in last season's opening game.\nThis season marks the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 Seahawks team that won Super Bowl XLVIII, a feat that seems like longer than a decade ago given all the suspect defense Seattle has played of late.\nBut on Monday night, in the same stadium where they claimed their lone Lombardi Trophy, the Seahawks turned back the clock and delivered a dominant defensive performance reminiscent of that 43-8 trouncing of the Denver Broncos.\nEleven sacks. Three takeaways plus a pair of turnovers on downs. A defensive touchdown. Only a field goal allowed.\nEat your heart out, Legion of Boom.\nCornerback Devon Witherspoon, the high-flying rookie cornerback whose aggressive style would have fit right in with the LOB, helped turn a close game into a runaway victory for Seattle with a 97-yard pick-six in the third quarter.\nThe Seahawks are 3-1 despite a long list of injuries, and they appeared to dodge another serious one when Geno Smith briefly left the game after hurting his knee. Teams usually don't like byes in Week 5, but the Seahawks won't complain about that right now.\nBuy on a breakout performance: This was already shaping up to be Witherspoon's breakout before his pick-six. He had a sack of Jones on a blitz and was credited with another sack on a backward pass. His touchdown came at a clutch time, with the Giants knocking on the door of a score that could have cut Seattle's lead to three points. The Seahawks were second-guessed left and right after taking Witherspoon fifth overall instead of Jalen Carter, who would have filled their most glaring need. But in addition to their off-the-field concerns with Carter, they also thought Witherspoon was the better player. Time will tell there, of course, but Witherspoon's immense talent is starting to shine after a slow start.\nPromising trend: Eleven sacks is a beyond promising development for Seattle's pass rush. It had been inconsistent over the first three games before exploding against the Giants. The 11 sacks tied a franchise record and more than doubled their combined total (five) heading into Monday night's game. Bobby Wagner, Jordyn Brooks, Witherspoon and Uchenna Nwosu all had two sacks apiece. This marks the first time since 1987 that a team had four players with multiple sacks in a game, per ESPN Stats & Information. The Seahawks have generated an NFL-best 46 pressures over the last two games, according to ESPN Stats & Info. They've had 20-plus pressures in both games, the first time they've done that in consecutive games since ESPN began tracking pressures in 2009.\nQB breakdown: Smith hadn't missed a snap in his first 21 games as the Seahawks' starter until he went down with a knee injury in the second quarter on a sideline tackle. He returned for the start of the second half and finished 13-of-20 for 110 yards and a touchdown. Drew Lock went 2-of-6 for 63 yards in relief, including tight end Noah Fant's 51-yard catch-and-run that set up a Walker III touchdown.\nTroubling trend: Adams' much-anticipated return lasted all of nine plays. He went down on the opening possession after taking a knee to the helmet and was ruled out after being evaluated for a concussion. Adams can't catch a break. Entering Monday night, he has missed 28 of a possible 53 regular-season games since Seattle acquired him in the blockbuster trade with the Jets in 2020. Also on Monday night, the Seahawks lost guards Damien Lewis (ankle) and Phil Haynes (calf) to injuries. Nose tackle Jarran Reed (shin) also left. -- Brady Henderson\nNext game: at Cincinnati Bengals (1 p.m. ET, Sunday, Oct. 15)\nThe Giants' offense is a mess. Jones has regressed to his old turnover-prone form. The result is the Giants' season has quickly slipped away only four ugly games into the season. Jones lost a fumble and threw two interceptions -- one that was returned 97 yards for a touchdown when the game was still in reach. Not that he received much help. The offensive line was a disaster and allowed 11 sacks. The Giants' special teams committed six penalties. This was bad. As the season slips away, the Giants will have to do something with road games in Miami and Buffalo on deck. It could get worse before it gets better.\nQB breakdown: Jones completed 27 of 34 passes for 203 yards and 2 interceptions. This isn't the quarterback everyone saw in the first season under coach Brian Daboll last season. Sure, Jones is under constant pressure, but he's also not playing well. Both can be true. The three turnovers were all on Jones. He now has six through four games this season. Did the Giants make a mistake giving Jones that $160 million deal? This was the third time in four games that he has played poorly. New York needs much better or this season will spiral out of control.\nTroubling trend: The Giants have been outscored 77-9 in first half of games this season. To say they've struggled in the first half would be an understatement. The Giants have yet to score a first-half touchdown through four games. They've managed only field goals of 44, 55 and 57 yards. Their minus-68 point differential in the first half of games is tied for the fourth worst for a team through four games in the Super Bowl era. This after the Giants talked all week about finding ways to start faster. It again didn't work.\nEye-popping NFL Next Gen stat: Seahawks tight end Fant's 19.8 expected yards after catch. That was what Fant was expected to get after being 15.34 yards from the nearest defender on his 51-yard catch late in the second quarter. But Fant got so much more, thanks to missed tackles along the sideline by inside linebacker Bobby Okereke and cornerback Adoree' Jackson. Fant racked up 46 yards after the catch on the play, and eventually was ruled down at the 1-yard line. Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III scored on the very next play.

(1:04)\nANAHEIM, Calif. -- Phil Nevin will not return as manager of the Los Angeles Angels, the team announced Monday.\nThe move comes a day after the club finished the season at 73-89. The Angels didn't schedule an end-of-the-season news conference with general manager Perry Minasian immediately after the season finale, raising questions about his future after three unsuccessful years in charge.\nMinasian will be available to the media Tuesday, the team said.\nIn making the official announcement, the Angels said that they have declined their option on Nevin's contract for 2024. Los Angeles will have its fourth manager in six years since the departure of Mike Scioscia, who held the job for 19 years.\nThe Angels flirted with playoff contention this season and went into \"buyer\" mode at the trade deadline. But they quickly faded from the race and placed several of their new additions on waivers.\nIn the end, Los Angeles finished 17 games behind the Houston Astros in the American League West, as well as 17 games off the pace in the wild-card race.\nThe Angels defeated the Oakland Athletics 7-3 on Sunday to close the season.\n\"I know it didn't go the way we wanted, but I'm proud of the way that room held together,\" Nevin said Sunday. \"It wasn't fun. It's not fun ending the way we did, but it's a great group in there. There's a lot of great things that are on the horizon here with the young players and the guys coming back. Good future.\"\nNevin went 119-149 in his first major league managerial job and missed the postseason in both of his seasons at the helm. He was promoted to Angels manager in June 2022 when Joe Maddon was fired in the middle of a 14-game losing streak.\nNevin, who had joined Maddon's staff as his third-base coach in November 2021, became the first Orange County native to manage the Angels.\nAs a former elite infielder who still carries himself like a ballplayer, Nevin appeared to be well-liked by his players. But the Angels didn't win for him, finishing 46-60 after he took over in 2022 before authoring the franchise's eighth straight losing record this season.\nNevin became the third MLB manager let go in four days, following Gabe Kapler of the San Francisco Giants and Buck Showalter of the New York Mets.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

Then I received a message that Xander was back on the team. That you can quote.

Europe has claimed eight of the past 11 Ryder Cups, as the U.S. team failed to end a road drought that dates to 1993.\nThe PGA of America, which runs the Ryder Cup in conjunction with Ryder Cup Europe, declined to comment to The Times and had not immediately replied to other media outlets' inquiries.\nThe Americans had an awful start to the competition, and the emotionally charged event was heightened by a story in Sky Sports reporting a fracture on the U.S. team led by Patrick Cantlay, who allegedly thought players should be compensated to play in the Ryder Cup. They are paid $200,000 to go to the charity of their choosing.\nCantlay repeatedly denied the allegation, saying the story was false and that he wasn't wearing a team hat because it didn't fit, not out of protest. He said the Ryder Cup was about representing the country and not about getting paid for competing.\nStill, he was taunted by spectators waving their hats toward him, and U.S. teammates showed a playful side by tipping their hats at him after a match victory.\nCantlay and Xander Schauffele apparently wanted the player agreement amended so that a Netflix documentary crew didn't have access to the team room while filming a second season of the \"Full Swing\" series, for which players are not compensated.\nLater, U.S. captain Zach Johnson said the team voted unanimously to keep out cameras to preserve the \"sanctity and sacredness of\" the team room.\nStefan Schauffele said more discussions are needed between the U.S. players, the PGA of America and Team Europe about how the money from the Ryder Cup is distributed. Instead, the organization is being secretive and noncommunicative, he said.\n\"They are using players' intellectual properties to make money, and the American players don't get paid,\" Stefan Schauffele told The Times. \"More importantly, this would become a nonissue if all proceeds, net proceeds, from the Ryder Cup were to be donated to common charitable causes. Right now, the American players are asked to donate their time pro bono in the name of patriotism so these organizations can benefit from the profits.\n\"The PGA [of America] uses this money, and the PGA Tour gets 20% that goes into the retirement of every member. The 12 players supposedly need to eat it, and their intellectual property gets abused for the benefit of 200 other people. That's not right.\""}

(0:45)\nPLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- Perhaps no NBA player has been associated with load management and the league's new player participation policy more than LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, but Leonard pushed back on that policy during the team's media day Monday -- saying that \"no league policy is helping me to play more games.\"\nLeonard was making his first comments since tearing the meniscus in his right knee during the Clippers' first-round playoff series against the Phoenix Suns in April. That injury marked the second time in three years that Leonard, 32, suffered a right knee injury in the postseason. He tore his right ACL during the second round of the team's 2021 run to the Western Conference finals.\nAfter that ACL injury, Leonard missed the 2021-22 season. He has not played in more than 60 games in any season since 2016-17.\nWhen first asked about the new policy that was passed last month, which states that teams must ensure no more than one star player is unavailable for the same game, Leonard asked what the new rules were.\nWhen a reporter answered, Leonard responded by noting that his on-again, off-again availability with the Toronto Raptors in the 2018-19 season -- when he led the team to a championship -- came while he was rehabilitating a knee injury.\n\"I'm not a guy that's sitting down because I'm doing load management -- well, when I was with the Raptors, it was different; like, I was coming [off] an injury,\" he said. \"And you have to know the details from the doctor.\n\"But if the league is seeing or trying to mock what I did with the Raptors, they should stop because I was injured during that whole year. But other than that, if I'm able to play, I'll play basketball. I work out every day in the summertime to play the game. So, no league policy is helping me to play more games.\"\nRegarding the new policy, Clippers coach Ty Lue said, \"If our players are healthy, they're going to play. I know there's a big thing, like, our guys don't like to play or whatever, but that's not true. Our guys want to play. Unfortunately, they've had injuries ... So, if our guys are healthy, they're going to play, and that's all we're really focused on.\"\nLeonard suffered his meniscus injury during the first game of the Clippers' first-round series against the Suns in April. He played through it in Game 2 of that series and then was ruled out for the next three games. Leonard underwent a cleanup procedure on the meniscus on June 6.\nLeonard said he didn't do anything especially new this offseason in terms of preparing his body for the season. Instead, he focused on the fickle nature of some injuries.\n\"It's a matter of, if you're going to trip on somebody; a lot of my injuries last year, I stepped on someone's foot or ran into somebody,\" Leonard said. \"You've got to control what you can control and get the treatments that you can and listen to your body, keep moving and see what happens.\"\nLeonard added later, \"You either going to get hurt or you're going to be lucky enough to play games throughout the playoffs or the whole regular season ... I'm not trying to get to a certain amount of games. I'm trying to play the games I can play. If I'm hurt, I can't play basketball. The last two years, unfortunately, I got hurt, tore my ACL, then, at the end of the year, tore my meniscus. It's basketball.\n\"I'm a two-way player. I play hard, so injuries are going to come. I'm not out there just walking around. I play both ends of the floor. I see the best players on both ends every night. Either I'm guarding the best player or the best player is guarding me. If an injury comes, that's what happens.\"\nLast week, Lawrence Frank, the Clippers' president of basketball operations, said Leonard and Paul George -- who was sidelined by a right knee sprain in that first-round series against Phoenix -- are \"fully healthy\" entering the team's training camp in Hawaii.\nFor all the acclaim when Leonard and George joined the Clippers, the two have rarely been healthy together during their four seasons together. They played just 38 games together last season, and, all told, they've played in just 142 total regular-season and postseason games combined, during which the team has posted a 96-46 record.\nWhen asked about the league's new policy, George said, \"If healthy, absolutely, I'm suiting up, and I want to play every night.\""}

(1:32)\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith limped off the field and missed two series late in the first half Monday night after a questionable tackle near the sideline by New York Giants linebacker Isaiah Simmons.\nSmith injured his knee on the play. He remained in the game for one more play before getting attended to in the medical tent.\n\"A dirty play. Dirty play,\" Smith told ESPN's Lisa Salters after he returned for the second half of Seattle's 24-3 victory. \"You guys can see it. It was a dirty play. It's no place in this sport for that and hopefully something happens, but other than that, the grace of God allowed me to come back into this game and I'm happy to be back out there.\"\nSmith made his displeasure known immediately. He later got flagged for taunting when he returned to the game in the third quarter.\n\nHe was still upset after the game despite the Seahawks (3-1) cruising into the bye week coming off a win. Smith finished 13-of-20 passing for 110 yards and a touchdown.\n\"I just don't respect that type of stuff,\" Smith said. \"There's no need for that type of stuff. It's a hard-fought game out there. We're all battling, but there's no need to take shots at guys running out of bounds on the sideline.\"\nSmith looked to be a bit limited upon returning and was moving gingerly on the knee. But he insists it's nothing major.\n\"I'm fine. I'm fine. God is good,\" he said.\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll's biggest gripe seemed to be more about how Smith was taken down than where. The play occurred near the Giants sideline after Smith had his pass batted back to him.\nIt actually went as a reception for minus-2 yards on the play.\n\"Yeah, that looked so dangerous,\" Carroll said. \"I don't know why we didn't see that differently. It just looked so dangerous. All of the effect of a horse-collar tackle happened, with the swing of the body that pulls down the back of the legs, and he got hurt on that play. A penalty wouldn't have rectified that, but it just looked like such a dangerous play it might have warranted a second look.\"\nThe Giants didn't feel the same about the hit. They thought it was clean.\nSimmons says he was just trying to make a tackle. Smith was running for yards after catching his own pass.\n\"I really don't got much to say about it,\" Simmons said. \"We playing football. He's mad he got hit? What do most quarterbacks do when they don't want to get hit? They go down. I don't really know what else to tell him about that.\"\nSimmons insists it was clean and that he started the tackle in bounds.\n\"Yeah, nobody is trying to hurt anybody out there. I want everyone to be great, you know what I mean? Nobody is trying to hurt anybody, so I would hate anyone intentionally trying to hurt me,\" Simmons said. \"None of that was intended. We're just trying to play hard and win.\"\nSmith originally thought it was safety Xavier McKinney who made the questionable tackle. The two had words on the field later in the series.\nMcKinney didn't seem too concerned about the play afterward.\n\"I don't know. I really don't care to be honest what he is saying or what he is doing,\" McKinney said. \"Don't really matter.\n\"Yeah, I thought the hit was fine.\" He chuckled. \"He'll be all right.\""}
{"title": "Goalie tandem picks: Which player should you draft?", "date": "2023-10-03 12:54:37", "text": "I feel like it's safer trying to predict the rainfall on a day six months from now than it is to confidently state how the goaltender position will play out in the coming fantasy hockey season.\nThat's not to say there aren't safer bets out there -- but you have to pay for them. Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Jake Oettinger, Connor Hellebuyck ... they are likely to be better investments for your fantasy squad, but they'll cost a high draft pick.\nBut winning your league last year was better accomplished by drafting Linus Ullmark and Alexandar Georgiev, which was just a matter of backing the right two sleepers. Who will those sleepers be this season? As implied, that's a tough call.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nMore than ever, a winning fantasy strategy can be lifted from the world of tandems. When one emerges and dominates, it's a low-cost draft investment that can lead to championships (think Ullmark). But even if the time split remains, goaltenders can earn fantasy value -- Ilya Samsonov placed 108th overall last season with only 50.2% crease share and Filip Gustavsson was 81st overall with only 46.5% crease share.\nWe've listed the teams below most likely to use a tandem this season. Some are more likely than others and some are just a guess given the current status of their goaltenders. There's also a chance we missed some that could emerge. But when doing your draft shopping for your crease, don't overlook the potential value of a goaltender projected to get just 50% of the crease share.\nRelevant stats for each goaltender include their crease share from last season, their overall ranking for fantasy, their fantasy points per 60 minutes, and their average draft position so far this draft season. Remember that an ADP higher than about 220 means they are not being drafted in most ESPN leagues.\nLinus Ullmark: 58.9% crease share, fourth overall fantasy points, 5.38 fantasy points per game (FPP60), 38.2 average draft position (ADP)\nJeremy Swayman: 41.1% crease share, 144th overall, 4.04 FPP60, 108.6 ADP\nThis is the potential tandem that will offer the most headaches for fantasy managers. Ullmark blew away the field last season and would be a no-brainer first-round fantasy pick if we knew he was going to do it again. But so many offseason changes, not the least of which was the retirement of Patrice Bergeron, leaves a lot of questions. Are the Bruins as good defensively? Do they win as frequently? But even beyond those questions, Swayman earned himself a raise and a chance to prove he has a long-term future as a starter for the club.\nI would not advise paying the premium for Ullmark given the question marks, but if he falls in your lap closer to the 70th-overall pick, I could get on board. Given that Swayman is on the weak side of the tandem, his draft price of 108th on average is also on the high end. But let's be clear: Both of these goaltenders have the potential to be fantasy difference-markers in 2023-24. The problem is that we can't say that with heaps of confidence for either one.\nAdin Hill: 33.7% crease share, 451st overall, 3.02 FPP60, 211.3 ADP\nLogan Thompson: 49.1% crease share, 248th overall, 2.99 FPP60, 241.9 ADP\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nNeither goaltender was a staple of fantasy clubs for most of last season, though Thompson had some nice runs earlier in the campaign. But we all know what Hill did after the regular season in leading the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup. There's an argument to be made that this isn't a tandem coming into the season, with Hill earning a massive raise, but Hill has never played more than 27 games in an NHL season before, so it's hard to call him a workhorse starter at this stage.\nThis will probably be a \"hot-hand\" crease, with whichever goaltender is having a solid run getting the lion's share of starts. After Hill was so dominant in the postseason, he would be my preference for a fantasy team. That said, there is a chance you can secure both later in drafts and have the crease of the defending champions locked up on your roster.\nStuart Skinner: 58.9% crease share, 132nd overall, 2.86 FPP60, 158.0 ADP\nJack Campbell: 41.1% crease share, 627th overall, 1.29 FPP60, 229.0 ADP\nThis tandem, like the Golden Knights, had a flip-flop from the regular season to the postseason. Skinner was the hero in the regular season, taking the starting job away from Campbell and keeping the Oilers on track for the playoffs. But Skinner stumbled in the postseason, with Campbell coming on in relief multiple times and not looking too bad. That narrative from the playoffs was arguably enough for a soft reset on whose crease this is coming into 2023-24.\nThe Oilers should win plenty of games with their overpowered offense and upgraded defense, but who is going to be in the crease for most of those wins? Skinner's ADP is very palatable, but you shouldn't completely count out Campbell at this stage. In fact, this might be an old school insurance scenario in which drafting Skinner means you should target Campbell in the final rounds to play it safe.

When both Andersen and Raanta were hurt last season, Kochetkov had a chance to show he could do the job in net. But the rookie faded with his chances later in the season, ultimately leaving the Hurricanes to decide to re-sign both Andersen and Raanta on fairly short-term deals. Kochetkov, now 24, can be sent down to the AHL without risking waivers, so he'll be the No. 3 goaltender for the Canes this season.\nThen there's the Andersen or Raanta debate. Raanta was the better goaltender of the two last season, posting better ratios and almost as many wins in fewer starts, but we are only two years removed from when Andersen finished 24th overall in fantasy in 2021-22 with 3.85 FPP60.\nHealth will be the first and foremost concern, as Andersen and Raanta were both fragile last season and the season prior (recall that Andersen missed the 2021-22 playoffs). That said, the Hurricanes wouldn't invest in Andersen and Raanta again unless they thought one of them could be the guy for at least one more season with Kochetkov still waiver eligible. Andersen's ADP is actually trending low if he ends up getting the bulk of starts here, which is the most likely scenario.\nCam Talbot: 40.1% crease share, 587th overall, 1.57 FPP60 (with Ottawa Senators), 219.5 ADP\nPheonix Copley: 42.2% crease share, 351st overall, 2.56 FPP60, 230.2 ADP\nAs much as Copley saved the Kings from themselves last season, he apparently didn't do enough to get a clear shot at the starter's gig yet. Copley was a huge stabilizer for the Kings last season, winning twice as many games as anyone else on the roster. But his ratios weren't great and faded down the stretch. The Kings brought in Joonas Korpisalo at the trade deadline, but Korpisalo opted for the Ottawa Senators in the offseason. The natural choice from there? Sign the Senators goaltender from last season. Cam Talbot had a rough year, earning almost no fantasy value, and is now 36 years old. The age is a major concern, as Talbot is past the spot on the goaltender curve where they usually remain productive for fantasy. But Copley, adequate, wasn't exactly changing the game for fantasy managers in his 37 games last season.\nTalbot hasn't had as much wear and tear as some other 36-year-old goaltenders, spending a lot of his career as a backup. So there is a world in which he can pull out another solid season behind a solid squad. Copley doesn't have a lot of upside, so the ideal situation here is Talbot hanging on for another year of value and getting the bulk of starts. He's the one to take a chance on.\nVitek Vanecek: 59.0% crease share, 111th overall, 3.08 FPP60, 116.2 ADP\nAkira Schmid: 18.2% crease share, 574th overall, 3.48 FPP60, 228.4 ADP\nJordan Binnington: 71.4% crease share, 541st overall, 1.00 FPP60, 228.1 ADP\nJoel Hofer: 6.4% crease share, 805th overall, 2.16 FPP60, 230.0, ADP\nNeither of these teams look like they will have a tandem on paper. But Schmid and Hofer have both shown glimpses and are both 23 coming into the season, which is about the age goaltenders really start coming on. If you are drafting Vanecek, Schmid is a good idea to handcuff. You probably shouldn't be looking at Binnington for your crease, but Hofer has upside if he pushes for more time.\nReady to play?

However, he failed to score a KO victory over a smaller Jermell Charlo -- who was moving up two divisions for the challenge -- to make a claim for a higher spot in the top 10.\nAlvarez (60-2-2, 39 KOs) dominated the fight from the start and dropped Charlo in Round 7 with a powerful overhand right. Alvarez won by scorecards of 118-109, 118-109 and 119-108, but he hasn't scored a stoppage win in almost two years -- an 11th-round TKO against Caleb Plant in November 2021.\nWith the three fighters in front of him in ESPN's pound-for-pound rankings -- Terence Crawford, Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk -- scoring incredible KO victories in their most recent fights, Alvarez wasn't able to convince our panelists to move him up the ladder.\nFurthermore, two-division champion and current ESPN boxing analyst and a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Timothy Bradley Jr., dropped Alvarez one spot on his list.\n\"While I understand that personal preferences, expectations and entertainment play a role in the P4P it's important to acknowledge and evaluate the reality of each fighter's performances,\" Bradley told ESPN. \"In this case of the top pound-for-pound boxers in the world, it's reasonable to expect dominant performances against opponents who are significantly lighter. Their skills and abilities are widely recognized, and it's natural to assume that they would overpower and knockout opponents outside their weight class.\n\"Regarding Canelo's recent performance, he fought a junior middleweight as a super middleweight 168-pounder and had a subpar performance, in my eyes.

{"title": "USWNT Big Board: With no coach and no momentum, how will 2024 Olympics team look?", "date": "2023-10-04 15:19:36", "text": "Lynn Williams joins \"Futbol Americas\" to talk about why the USWNT failed at the FIFA Women's World Cup. (1:41)\nThe U.S. women's national team has no coach, no coherent tactical identity and nothing to build upon after a worst-ever round-of-16 exit in the Women's World Cup. And yet the USWNT is about 10 months away from another marquee tournament in the form of the 2024 Olympics.\nLet's start out with a basic point: the Olympics, which are a senior competition on the women's side (unlike the men's side), -- are not nearly as important as the World Cup. At just 12 teams, it's not even half the size of the World Cup. But winning a gold medal at the Olympics in France next summer would certainly soothe some of the sting from hitting that lowest point in USWNT history -- a round of 16 exit -- this year.\nWho will be the players who can help the USWNT do that? It's hard to say with any certainty without a coach. Enter ESPN's 2024 USWNT Big Board.\nRemember: the point of the Big Board is not to predict what the team will look like next summer, but take the pulse of where the USWNT stands right now. Will the next coach have a turnkey roster and strong player pool to work with? Or will he or she need to do some work to get the squad into shape? Let's take a look.\nIf the USWNT were to compete in the Olympics today, who should start? Who should be on the roster? That's what we're trying to figure out.\nThere's no coach, of course -- U.S. Soccer wants to hire one by December -- so we have no previous lineups or statements on which to base this depth chart. Instead, this is a bit of the author's opinion (hi, that's me!) and a bit of analyzing where the player pool seems to be trending. We don't know if the USWNT will drastically change formations under the new coach -- wingbacks, anyone? -- so for now we're assuming the USWNT's tactical shape will look similar to how it has for the past few years.\nAn important roster note up top, too: Olympic rosters are much different than for the World Cup. They are traditionally much smaller than World Cup rosters -- while a Women's World Cup squad comprises 23 players, with three of them required to be goalkeepers, an Olympic squad is just 18 players, with two specific goalkeepers.\nAnother difference is that Olympic rosters have four alternates, one of them a goalkeeper -- players who aren't available for games, but do travel and train with the team, only joining the roster in case of tournament-ending injury. For the delayed 2021 Olympics, alternates were added to the full roster because of the pandemic, but it's unclear whether that will happen again.\nWe're categorizing the Big Board like this:\nTier 1: Starters.  A clear first-choice player.\nTier 2: In the squad. Not a starter, but a substitute and player on the bench available to go into games.\nTier 3: On the bubble.  These are possible alternates, or players who might miss out on the Olympics completely. Players who have had a passing look or players who were once integral but no longer seem in favor fit into this category.\nTier 4: Longshots. These are the players whose chances of making the Olympics at the moment look low. This includes players performing well for their clubs who haven't gotten a look. This category also includes injured players who, today, aren't healthy enough to make it (and it doesn't mean their status can't change once they recover).\nStarter:  Alyssa Naeher\nIn the squad:  Casey Murphy\nOn the bubble:  Aubrey Kingsbury, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Katie Lund, Jane Campbell, Bella Bixby\nLongshot:  Adrianna Franch\nOther than centerback Naomi Girma, who was a breakout star in her debut World Cup, the USWNT's best player in New Zealand and Australia was quite possibly Alyssa Naeher. She continues to play well for the USWNT, even if she hasn't enjoyed the same level of shot-stopping domestically with her Chicago Red Stars.\nThe question: who will be her backup? Casey Murphy still seems to be the No. 2 and based on her time with the USWNT, that probably hasn't changed, regardless of anything happening in the NWSL. But Aubrey Kingsbury, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Katie Lund, Jane Campbell and Bella Bixby are all viable options as a third goalkeeper or an alternate. After Adrianna Franch lost her starting spot in Kansas City and then didn't make the USWNT's World Cup team, it seems her time with the national team is over.\nAubrey Kingsbury, 31, was the third goalkeeper at the World Cup based on her strong club play for the Washington Spirit. But 26-year-old Tullis-Joyce, who just completed a move to Manchester United, and 26-year-old Lund, who has been excellent for Racing Louisville, could deserve a shot. It's not too soon to get some younger goalkeepers time with the team and get a succession plan behind 35-year-old Naeher. In fact, it probably makes more sense to call in some younger, less experienced goalkeepers for the third and fourth spots.\nStarters: Crystal Dunn, Emily Fox\nIn the squad:  Sofia Huerta\nOn the bubble:  M.A. Vignola, Kelley O'Hara, Casey Krueger, Hailie Mace, Carson Pickett\nLongshot:  Jenna Nighswonger, Imani Dorsey, Caprice Dydasco, Kristen McNabb, Merritt Mathias\nCrystal Dunn shares her hopes for what she would like to see from the next USWNT manager.\nIt's really hard to say who should or will be on the team outside of the starters, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox, who didn't really do anything to lose their spots during the World Cup. It seems like everyone else is fighting just to get a call.\nSofia Huerta has had a lot of call-ups with the USWNT, but she's better at attacking than defending, thus she can be a liability, and she didn't play during the World Cup. Kelley O'Hara has been consistently solid for the USWNT, but she's increasingly injury prone as she nears the twilight of her career. Casey Krueger has been a better defender than attacker and the USWNT likes to play more attacking soccer, but she's solid enough on both sides that she has a strong case.\nM.A. Vignola just earned her first cap for the USWNT in a friendly last month. Hailie Mace and Carson Pickett have both been in with the USWNT before, but very much seem to be on the outskirts of the player pool. That gives way to several players who have been good for their clubs, but have been unable to gain a foothold in the USWNT.\nIf I were coach -- and to be clear, U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker has not called me yet -- I'd start turning the page to the 2027 World Cup cycle. That could mean potentially bringing in Vignola because the USWNT desperately needs to build some fullback depth. A player like 22-year-old Jenna Nighswonger isn't ready for the Olympics, but might deserve a call-up based on solid NWSL play, versatility in being able to play multiple positions and, again, an alarming lack of depth in the pool. The USWNT needs more options.\nGoing into the Olympics, the USWNT's defense has been solid enough that leaning a bit more attack-minded for the Olympics with Huerta seems worth it. The next coach, who will be coming in with no track record, might feel the need to go with a safer choice like Krueger or O'Hara.\nStarters:  Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson\nIn the squad:  Emily Sonnett\nOn the bubble:  Becky Sauerbrunn, Alana Cook\nLongshot:  Abby Dahlkemper, Emily Madril, Lilly Reale, Sarah Gorden, Katie Ling, Paige Nielsen, Sam Hiatt, Sam Staab, Emily Menges, Tatumn Milazzo\nFirst of all, is Emily Sonnett even a centerback? Is she a fullback? Is she a defensive midfielder now? This is something the next coach needs to decide, but right now we're slotting her in at centerback because the USWNT has few proven options there. We've also given her a confirmed spot in the squad because on a small Olympics roster, having a player who can fit multiple positions is incredibly valuable.\nIt might seem a bit harsh to drop Alana Cook from being on the World Cup team to fighting for a spot for the Olympics, but she didn't play at all during the tournament and, in the lead-up to the World Cup, Cook didn't really do enough in games to have earned a spot. An injury to Becky Sauerbrunn and a too-late recovery from Tierna Davidson seemed like the catalyst.\nWith Julie Ertz retired, clear starter Naomi Girma could use another veteran alongside her, and Sauerbrunn is still not playing 90 minutes since her pre-World Cup injury. Davidson fits the bill. Abby Dahlkemper only recently returned from a long layoff for a back injury; she needs more games under her belt, but it's a promising return for the former USWNT centerback.\nStarters:  Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Andi Sullivan\nIn the squad:  Ashley Sanchez, Savannah DeMelo, Sam Coffey\nOn the bubble:  Jaedyn Shaw, Kristie Mewis, Taylor Kornieck\nLongshot:  Jaelin Howell, Olivia Moultrie, Samantha Mewis, Morgan Gautrat, Dani Weatherholt, Lo'eau LaBonta, Chloe Ricketts, Korbin Albert\nThe go-to trio of Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan and Andi Sullivan feels like it shouldn't change -- unless the USWNT changes its formation and configures its midfield differently. (Let's face it, the USWNT probably needs to change its tactical system based on the players it has, but that's a whole other conversation.) Regardless, these are three players who should be at the Olympics.\nSullivan has taken a lot of criticism for not being Ertz, basically, but under the right tactical setup (i.e., the too-late formation shift against Sweden at the World Cup), she is a solid defensive midfielder. We don't know what tactical setup the USWNT will have under the next coach, but there isn't a tactical system in which Sullivan suddenly doesn't have any role with the USWNT.\nOutside of these three, however, it's time for the USWNT to go younger. Ashley Sanchez, 24, didn't play at all at the World Cup, and she should've. With the sensational season that 25-year-old Savannah DeMelo was having, it seemed unfair to name her to the World Cup roster without a USWNT cap to her name. She had no time to build chemistry with the players around her or figure out where she fit in, and we didn't see her at her best.\nSam Coffey, 24, should be the USWNT's next defensive midfielder. Jaelin Howell, 23, is currently injured, but is an interesting alternative to Coffey.\nStarter: Lynn Williams, Trinity Rodman\nIn the squad:  Alyssa Thompson\nOn the bubble:  Margaret \"Midge\" Purce\nLongshot:  Mallory Swanson, Cece Kizer, Melanie Barcenas, Christen Press, Tobin Heath\nHerc Gomez brands Megan Rapinoe's 17-year USWNT career one of the most dominant eras in sporting history.\nMallory Swanson is listed as a long shot right now only because she's injured. (If Swanson had been healthy, the USWNT's World Cup probably would've gone much better.)\nNo one on the USWNT right now provides the service and creates the chances that now-retired Megan Rapinoe used to, particularly on set pieces. In a sense, that makes this position feel more open than the relative strength of the player options suggests. The USWNT needs wingers who can play provider -- the World Cup, where it seemed like the USWNT's wingers were just strikers, proved that.\nLynn Williams is a dependable player who will press relentlessly, create chances, track back to defend and do all the things the USWNT needs. She might not be the best at everything, but she is good and well rounded. Trinity Rodman, under the right setup, will flourish on the wing. Rodman didn't flourish during the World Cup, but that's why the Olympics can't be the same lineup as the World Cup was -- almost no one flourished. Move some pieces around Rodman and change her role slightly, and her effectiveness should be unlocked.\nEven after making the World Cup team, Alyssa Thompson's inclusion seems more about building toward 2027 rather than winning an Olympics. If you want to follow the model of former coach Jill Ellis, who bombed at an Olympics but then won a World Cup, this makes sense. She barely played at the World Cup and should've seen the field more.\nStarter:  Sophia Smith\nIn the squad:  Alex Morgan\nOn the bubble: Jaedyn Shaw, Mia Fishel, Ashley Hatch\nLongshot: Catarina Macario, Kristen Hamilton, Bethany Balcer\nSophia Smith has played as a winger on the USWNT, including at the World Cup, but that tournament proved Smith should be playing in front of goal. She's an elite striker in the NWSL, and asking her to play out wide means some of her best attributes don't translate and get lost. Her World Cup was bad, and you can place some of the blame on her role.\nAlex Morgan has been a great striker for the USWNT and in the NWSL, but she struggled badly at the World Cup -- her failed penalty kick in the opening game of the tournament became an omen for her first World Cup without scoring a goal. Is she still effective? Probably: she wasn't getting the best service during the World Cup. But with an eye toward the next World Cup, it might suit 34-year-old Morgan to come off the bench instead.\nThe big question is what happens when Catarina Macario comes back from injury -- she still hasn't played in a game since last year, but played as both a striker and a midfielder for the USWNT. (I'd argue with her excellent vision, service and ability on the ball, playing as a winger could suit her -- especially with a lack of wingers in the player pool with her skills.) Macario is the kind of player who needs to be on the field -- once fit, at least.\nAnother question: Should 18-year-old Jaedyn Shaw be a central attacking midfielder, or a striker? She says she prefers to be a No. 10 playmaker, but the USWNT player pool might have more room right now for another striker and, well, she's good at both. Either way, she is a player whose development is worth keeping an eye on. If the next coach goes full bore on the next generation for the Olympics, Shaw could even take Morgan's spot."}

{"title": "What's it like to be recruited by Deion Sanders? Prospects, parents give the inside scoop", "date": "2023-10-05 04:15:26", "text": "Deion Sanders is encouraged by Colorado's performance in its loss against USC and warns the Buffaloes' detractors about what's coming. (0:55)\nWHEN ADRIAN WALKER scheduled his unofficial visit to Colorado for the Week 3 game against Colorado State, he had no idea he'd be there with Lil Wayne, Master P, Offset and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\nBut that's exactly where Walker and the other recruits on campus found themselves, in what is now the new norm with Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes. It's not just locker room tours and meetings with coaches, recruits are seeing a whole different pitch from Sanders and his staff.\n\"It was crazy that Lil Wayne was right there,\" said Walker, a 2025 wide receiver recruit. \"I shook The Rock's hand and to be in that type of moment was crazy. Being that close to celebrities and being in that moment was unbelievable.\"\nThe parade of celebrities, which included musicians and hall of fame athletes, continued at Saturday's game against the USC Trojans.\n\"Deion can bring these guys out based off of him and the relationships that he has with people,\" Mantrez Walker, a 2025 linebacker recruit who visited for the USC game, said. \"A player might come back [at a different school] if he's an alumni, or he's being honored for something, but nowhere else is going to have all those guys in one place.\"\nThe first three weeks of the season -- with wins over TCU, Nebraska and Colorado State -- brought the starpower and hype to Colorado, which went 1-11 last season. The next two games -- losses to Oregon and USC -- have shown how far the roster needs to go.\nIn the three recruiting classes before Sanders' arrival, Colorado didn't finish higher than 34th in the ESPN recruiting class rankings. In two of those classes (2021, 2022), the Buffaloes did not sign an ESPN 300 prospect.\nColorado's 2024 recruiting class has eight total commitments, including two ranked in the ESPN 300 with Aaron Butler and Brandon Davis-Swain. Sanders is still trying to add to that 2024 class and make a splash by going after some big targets, including five-star Texas A&M commit Cam Coleman, who visited for the USC game. He is getting a head start in 2025, and had Mantrez Walker, ESPN Junior 300 receiver Taz Williams Jr. and ESPN Jr. 300 defensive end Christopher Burgess Jr. on campus for the game against the Trojans, as well.\nSanders has had stunning recruiting wins the past two cycles, flipping elite playmakers and using the transfer portal to bring 86 new players into the program in one offseason. When Sanders was at Jackson State from 2020-2022, he flipped five-star cornerback Travis Hunter from Florida State on national signing day in the 2022 cycle. He did it again in 2023 when he got five-star defensive back Cormani McClain to Colorado from Miami.\nRecruits from the 2024 and 2025 classes and their parents are paying attention. Not just to the hype, but to the no-nonsense, disciplinarian coach at the center of the process and the two-time consensus All-American, two-time Super Bowl winner and Pro and College Football Hall of Famer who has succeeded in every part of the sport.\n\"He makes the time to make you feel special and he puts it all on the table,\" Leon Edwards, the father of CU freshman running back Dylan Edwards, a former ESPN 300 recruit, said. \"It was a no-brainer from there, because it's just Deion is the truth and he puts the truth on the table and those kids just absorb it. They want to play for someone that has done the things that he has done and has stood on his word.\n\"I think that's where he wins.\"\nSANDERS IS FOND of saying, \"I ain't hard to find,\" when talking to recruits and detractors alike. Recruits, however, should not expect an open line to the Colorado coach.\n\"I don't think Coach Prime gives his number to any recruit, from what I know,\" Butler, a 2024 CU commit and the No. 80 prospect in the ESPN 300, told ESPN. \"It's just how he is and he doesn't want dudes just having his number. When you're playing for him, it's serious, it ain't no fandom. His job is to coach and when you get there, he's going to coach you.\"\nIf a recruit wants to talk to Sanders or he wants to talk to a recruit, an assistant coach will facilitate it. When it comes to recruiting, Sanders is as personable and hands-on as he can be, especially when recruits and families are on campus.\n\"He's just a laid-back person, he just talks about life. He said [on a visit], 'Don't lie to a kid,' and that really made my mom smile,\" ESPN 300 recruit Kamron Mikell said. \"I think recruits are drawn to him, because people see him as somebody who turns us kids into believers and he makes everyone believe in themselves.\"\nWhen Davis-Swain, a defensive end recruit, arrived at Pasta Jay's during an official visit to Colorado in June, he and his father, Brandon Davis, saw a more laid-back version of Sanders.\nPasta Jay's, a quaint 35-year-old Italian restaurant in Boulder with a sign out front that reads \"Prime for President,\" has become Sanders' go-to place for hosting recruits and their families on official visits.\nInside, Sanders and the recruits have the place to themselves. The Buffaloes' coach held court as the appetizers rolled out, followed by what seemed like unlimited pizza and pasta.\nDavis had been around Sanders briefly on the visit, but never in this relaxed, intimate setting. He didn't know what to expect and was still a little star struck, realizing he was eating dinner with Deion Sanders.\n\"It's Prime Time,\" Davis said with a big laugh.\nThese on-campus visits might be much more valuable during this recruiting cycle. After having surgery in March 2022 to have two toes amputated and part of a muscle taken out to help with circulation, Sanders had not been able to travel. Sanders had another procedure over the summer to relieve blood clots in both legs. Because of that, Colorado recruits and their families haven't been able to spend as much time in-person with Sanders.\nWhen Butler and his family took an official visit to Colorado in April, they met Sanders in a room off his personal office.\nThe room has a wall of windows overlooking Folsom Field with the mountains in the distance. Sanders typically sits in a leather chair that feels purposefully higher off the ground than where the prospects are sitting.\nThe conversations are more akin to the Pasta Jay's experience than they are the flash and extravagance. They can range from how the prospect fits on the field, what is expected of them, life lessons or sometimes just cracking jokes. And they quickly get past Sanders' celebrity.\nComplete recruiting coverage »\n2024 recruits you need to know »\nClass rankings » | ESPN 300 »\nStorylines to watch » | Latest commits »\nRecapping the 2023 recruiting cycle »\n\"It was right after they had offered me and [Sanders] pulled a couple of us [recruits] aside and had a sit-down with him for about 30 minutes,\" Talan Chandler, a three-star offensive line commit, said. \"It's Coach Prime, you're meeting with Deion Sanders and you're shell shocked, but he's just such a charismatic guy and he's super genuine. He doesn't have an ego, he doesn't think he's better than you and he makes you feel like he cares about you.\"\nThere are plenty of coaches who relate to recruits, but Sanders, according to Walker, has different qualities that differentiate him from other coaches.\n\"Having a coach who went through the recruiting process, went through the collegiate process and went to the NFL,\" Walker said. \"Being coached by a guy like that and in a place where you can be you and you can get your name out there. You can get the connections you need, you can develop, he's not afraid to play freshman and he's a player's coach.\n\"It's all those things combined.\"\nRobb-Davon and Courtney Butler, the parents of Aaron Butler, have known Sanders since Robb and Sanders played together for a season with the Baltimore Ravens. He knew Prime Time, and they didn't fully know how Sanders would be different.\n\"Make no bones about it, Coach Prime is a different man than Prime Time. Prime doesn't have anybody on his team that's like him in terms of the character Prime Time,\" Robb-Davon Butler said. \"He wouldn't have any of it. There's no way you can get away with being how he was when he was in that age or even as a pro and play for him. There is individuality, but there are no individuals above the team.\"\nSanders' attention to detail, the people he has surrounded himself with and how important every recruit seems to be is something the Butler family said they had not experienced at many other schools. When Courtney had surgery, the Colorado staff sent her cards wishing her well on the procedure, they were shocked that they even remembered the surgery was taking place let alone the date.\nDavis told Sanders about being a single father and raising his son Brandon, the struggle it has taken to get to this point and how their future could be impacted through his son getting an opportunity to play college football. Every time Davis was on campus or with Sanders, he said the two would sit as if there were no other obligations the coach needed to take care of.\nThe parents are an important part of the recruiting process for Sanders and his staff, as they are at most schools, and the staff makes it a point of emphasis to make them feel welcome, as well.\nWhile at Pasta Jay's, the families and recruits all eat, but there will be times where the parents hang back at the restaurant with some of the coaches while the recruits continue their visit or tours with players or personnel staff. Sanders and his coaches will often bring board games and playing cards and play games with the parents, talking, joking and showing that down-to-earth side that most have now experienced.\n​​\"Deion could go host the Grammy's or he can come sit in your backyard at a family barbecue,\" Omar Stoutmire, the father of 2023 Colorado signee Carter Stoutmire, said. \"You'd be shocked at how down to earth he is, he's like a chameleon.\"\nWHILE SANDERS EMBRACES the hype of being Prime Time for outsiders, something is different inside the program, according to recruits.\n\"His principles, like if you're talking to him and you're slouching, he'll make you sit up and he'll get on you,\" Chandler said. \"He holds everything to a top standard and there's just something about that, that's very, I'd say attractive to a recruit.\n\"Like, that's excellence right there.\"\nSanders tells recruits to sit up or tuck in their shirts. Cursing isn't allowed and Sanders tells players to take off their hats, something Colorado State coach Jay Norvell criticized Sanders about. The players who can deal with those standards are the ones who stick around. The players who don't will know up front that Sanders won't let anything slide just because they're a five-star or an instant-impact transfer.\nWhen Sanders flipped McClain from Miami in the last recruiting cycle, it was a big win for the program and Sanders at the last minute. McClain, however, did not play in the first three games of the season before playing late in the blowout loss to the Oregon Ducks and most of the USC game, where he broke up a pass in the end zone.\nAfter the Oregon game, Sanders was asked what McClain could do to see more playing time.\n\"Study. Prepare. Be on time for meetings. Show up to the dern meetings. Understand what we're doing as a scheme,\" Sanders said. \"Want to play this game. Desire to play this game. Desire to be the best in this game at practice, in the film room and on your own free time.\"\nSanders preaches the same accountability in the recruiting process and doesn't promise anything to prospects.\n\"Oftentimes when coaches recruit, the recruits come in and the recruits are interviewing the coaches. We're interviewing the recruits to make sure you have the intangibles,\" Sanders said on \"College GameDay.\" \"Smart, tough, fast, disciplined with character. But not only that, that you love the game. You've got an affinity and passion for the game.\"\nButler was recruited by major programs, including Alabama, Georgia, Miami, Oregon, Washington. He saw the accountability and character as a differentiator and something that attracted him even more to what Sanders was building.\n\"​​Just being around [Sanders] when I was up there and then through the recruiting process, you can see the main goal and the main thing is winning and, before anything else, getting the right dudes in there,\" Butler said. \"He's not going to let you slack off or slouch in front of him. He's going to make sure you're ready to perform and perform at the level that you're expected to.\"\nIt wasn't always that way, though, as Butler took a visit to Colorado in March before the mass offseason exodus that saw 47 players enter the portal during the spring transfer window in April. Butler wasn't impressed with the talent on the field and wasn't sure Colorado would be the place where he could compete against the best and achieve his goals.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nHe came home from the visit with the feeling he could have started immediately on that roster. When he saw Sanders turning over the roster and bringing in more talent, he was excited about what that would mean for the future and for his recruitment.\n\"Being in that environment, I get to prove myself and it's a great opportunity because in a room with the right type of dudes pushing me, the type of dudes they have right now,\" Butler said. \"I'm looking at going there and competing with the top [players], so just having the opportunity to work with Travis Hunter and get better with him and push him to get better, it's a beautiful thing. If you're somebody, you're not going to sit on the back of the porch and want to play with the little pups, you gotta jump out there and really show what it is to everybody right off the rip.\"\nIt's that mentality Sanders is searching for. By being strict and sticking to who he is during the recruiting process, he's targeting prospects with a similar mentality.\nWhile Colorado's 2024 class has just three four-star commits, Sanders and his staff still have time until the early signing period in late December as well as the transfer portal periods to add to the class. Sanders might even flip another high-profile recruit like he has done in the past two classes.\nColeman visited Colorado for the USC game despite his commitment to the Aggies. He's the No. 8 prospect overall and would be a third five-star to flip to the program if Sanders is able to pull it off. Colorado is also heavily recruiting five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood, the top prospect in the 2025 class. Underwood visited Colorado for the Colorado State game.\nThese are the kinds of players Sanders will need to land to turn Colorado from the best show in college football to a legit contender. Those already on board won't bet against him.\n\"He's charismatic and genuine and the people that he brings around him are all the same, they all just have that love and passion for football,\" Chandler said. \"He's building a culture and brings a championship mindset around him. To be recruited by him, as he tells you, we're coming here to win championships. This is what we want, we want excellence here.\""}
{"title": "After a massive shake-up, what lies ahead for the Bucks, Celtics and the East's best?", "date": "2023-10-05 04:22:45", "text": "Stephen A. Smith discusses his expectations for the Bucks this season after acquiring Damian Lillard. (1:03)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season kicks off Monday, when media day marks the start of training camp for 28 of the 30 teams across the league. (The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves kicked off their camps on Thursday.)\nThat includes all 15 Eastern Conference teams, some of which are still reeling from the seismic trades of Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks and, after a few days as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, Jrue Holiday to the Boston Celtics.\nWhat are the deals' ripple effects throughout the conference? What could they mean for the future of another star guard, the Philadelphia 76ers' James Harden? Are there more moves on the horizon for the Bucks and Celtics? What's next for the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers after mostly standing pat this offseason?\nAs camps get underway, here's a quick trip around the East, looking at the five biggest questions among the top contenders for home-court advantage in the conference.\nFor all of the attention surrounding the Bucks and Celtics for their blockbuster trades, those completed deals now push Harden's uncertain future to the forefront.\nThis summer, Harden made his feelings clear about Daryl Morey, Philadelphia's president of basketball operations and Harden's longtime ally and advocate going back to successful seasons together with the Houston Rockets. These days, though, there seems to be little love for Morey from Harden.\nNow that Lillard and Holiday are off the board, it's difficult to see the kind of star player coming back to Philadelphia that Morey has publicly declared would be required for Harden to be dealt. Until either Morey changes his stance or some team meets his terms, Harden's lone path to being paid this season is by playing for the 76ers.\nSo, how will Harden react? Will he be fully committed? Is there a world where he could remain in Philadelphia for the entire season?\nAll of these questions, and others, will be asked of Harden on Monday at the team's media day at its practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, and then in the days to come during the team's training camp in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nHarden can be asked those questions only if he actually shows up.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey and coach Nick Nurse address James Harden's absence from media day and his trade request.\nMeanwhile, the 76ers will be adjusting to life under a new coach, former Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse, and it's safe to say the league's reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, registered his feelings about the summer by tweeting Sunday afternoon, \"This offseason was fun lmao.\"\nFor a Philadelphia franchise that has been consumed by virtually constant drama for a decade, there will be no shortage of it in the coming weeks.\nThe Heat never think they are out of options when it comes to acquiring talent, a hard-earned belief from nearly three decades of team president Pat Riley's tenure lording over the franchise.\nBut it's hard to argue this summer has been anything but a disappointment for the reigning East champs. Miami attempted to acquire Damian Lillard -- the exact kind of ball-dominant guard who would have been a perfect fit alongside Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.\nHoliday, while not Lillard from an offensive standpoint, is the type of tough-minded two-way player the Heat have always gravitated toward throughout Riley's tenure and would have fit seamlessly next to Butler on the perimeter.\nInstead, the Heat's chief competition -- the Bucks and Celtics -- landed the star guards, and two key players from last season's stunning playoff run -- Gabe Vincent and Max Strus -- signed with the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively, in free agency.\n\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nThe Heat, who pride themselves on getting contributions from unheralded role players, did bring back Josh Richardson on a team-friendly deal to replace Vincent, will be moving Duncan Robinson into Strus' role as a floor spacer and scorer -- one he occupied before Strus stepped into it over the past season-plus -- and will look for contributions from second-year forward Nikola Jovic and rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr., two of the players who could've gone out in a deal for a guard who instead wound up staying put.\nMiami should remain in the hunt for any stars who become available. But this summer was a short-term setback. And while doubting either Jimmy Butler or coach Erik Spoelstra should be done at one's peril, Miami's road to a fourth conference finals in five seasons got a lot tougher over the past week.\nBetween the Bucks swinging for the fences with Lillard and the Celtics doing the same with Holiday, it's been a wild week atop the East.\nIn Milwaukee, there might not be a better one-two punch in the NBA, in terms of star power, than Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. The duo should help the Bucks' offense skyrocket up league rankings after finishing 15th last season (albeit with three-time All-Star forward Khris Middleton missing most of the season with injuries).\nBrian Windhorst explains why the Milwaukee Bucks are under tremendous pressure to win an NBA championship to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo.\nMilwaukee's perimeter defense, eighth in the league last season in opponent 3-point percentage, takes a significant step back with the loss of Holiday, arguably the NBA's best two-way guard.\nBoston, on the other hand, started the offseason by sending Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of a three-team trade to land Kristaps Porzingis and ended it with another massive swing in getting Holiday.\nThe Celtics enter training camp with arguably the best top six in the league -- Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Al Horford, Porzingis and Holiday -- but the overflow of talent leaves questions over whether Horford or White will be the one to come off the bench.\nThe four others, however, figure to end virtually every game on the court together, and give Boston arguably an unmatched level of versatility.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nBeyond its top six, Boston's roster is littered with either lower-paid or inexperienced options for second-year coach Joe Mazzulla. Horford and Porzingis, the team's two stretch big men, come with durability concerns, given Horford is 37 and Porzingis has played 65 or more games only three times in nine NBA seasons.\nAnd while the Celtics still have all but one of their future firsts to put in deals even after getting Holiday, they don't have much salary to put together to make a deal to upgrade the roster.\nBy the time the Celtics and Bucks meet for the first time on Nov. 22 in Boston (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN), we'll have a lot more of an idea of what these groups look like. As of now, though, these two teams appear poised to be on a playoff collision course for the fourth time in the past seven seasons.\nAfter a five-year playoff absence, it was a rough return for Cleveland, which lost in five games to the New York Knicks as the higher-seeded team -- including twice on its home court. Throughout that first-round series, the Cavaliers looked severely hampered by their lack of postseason experience, as well as really bothered by their lack of perimeter shooting, as New York sagged far off poor-shooting options like forward Isaac Okoro throughout the series.\nThe Cavaliers made it a priority to address their shooting deficiencies this offseason, signing Max Strus from the Heat and Georges Niang from the 76ers. Both of them will give Cleveland a lot more offensive versatility and should prevent the Cavaliers from returning to the rotating cast of characters who struggled to adequately fill the fifth spot on the court last season alongside the quartet of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen.\nThe duo's presence also should allow Cleveland more versatility to play small, something the Cavs didn't have an easy way to do last season.\nThe overarching question for this season in Cleveland, however, surrounds Mitchell, and whether Cleveland can do enough to convince the four-time All-Star to agree to a contract extension next summer, when he will be one year away from free agency.\nDoing so begins with improving on last season's first-round flop. Strus and Niang were brought in to play a part in that. Another factor will be the offensive development of Mobley, who has quickly become a dominant force defensively but is still a ways away from the two-way star Cleveland will need to contend with the likes of Milwaukee and Boston.\nIt was another relatively quiet offseason for the Knicks, who made a shrewd pickup to land Donte DiVincenzo as a free agent, pairing him with Villanova teammates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart.\nBut standing pat made sense. New York had a breakthrough last season, beating Cleveland to reach the second round of the playoffs behind the play of last year's home run free agent signing in Brunson, and giving hope to the legions of Knicks fans in the tristate area that a brighter future might finally be around the corner.\nNew York is still waiting, however, for the moment when it can push in its chips for the right player. The Knicks chose not to do so with Mitchell last summer. They didn't with Beal, Lillard or Holiday this year.\nBut what if someone like Antetokounmpo or Embiid becomes available next summer? What if Cleveland struggles and Mitchell, a year away from free agency, makes it clear he won't stay?\nIf a disgruntled superstar suddenly becomes available via trade, the Knicks, between their combination of draft assets and players under contract, are positioned to make an enticing offer.\nIn the meantime, if the Knicks can build on the momentum they've created with their play last season -- their playoff series win was the franchise's first since 2013 -- the appeal of playing home games inside Madison Square Garden could return."}

(0:55)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season is just weeks away, and as the players and coaches prepare for training camp, our NBA insiders are breaking down some of the biggest things we overheard from this season's media days.\nThe San Antonio Spurs' highly anticipated rookie, Victor Wembanyama, is no stranger to the media as the first overall pick prepares for his first NBA training camp amid expectations he will help lead San Antonio alongside Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson.\nOther teams got to introduce their biggest offseason additions. The Milwaukee Bucks debuted recently acquired seven-time All-Star Damian Lillard alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez.\nThere are still some organizations with serious questions to address heading into the season. The Boston Celtics will face some growing pains with a revamped coaching staff on top of the offseason additions of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. The Memphis Grizzlies, who grabbed media attention for all the wrong reasons last season, will be confronted with questions about navigating Ja Morant's 25-game suspension for conduct detrimental to the league.\nAnd most notably, the Philadelphia 76ers will try to manage the drama surrounding James Harden, who did not attend media day as he continues to seek a trade.\nHere's what players, coaches and teams are talking about as media day kicked off across the league.\nJump to a team:\nBOS | DEN | DET | GS | LAC\nLAL | MEM | MIL | PHI | SA\n\nLike everywhere else around the league, it had a lot of \"first day of school\" energy. There also was a healthy dose of optimism about contending with a roster that includes the reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, a championship coach in Nick Nurse and versatile veteran talent.\nBut the specter of James Harden's absence -- and when or if the disgruntled point guard will return to the team -- hovered over it all.\nIt made for a confusing scene that likely won't get much clearer as the team shifts to Colorado State's campus in Fort Collins, Colorado, for training camp the rest of this week.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey opened his presser by declaring the team needs to be given time to prove it can achieve its lofty expectations. Embiid, meanwhile, questioned an assertion that Milwaukee and Boston had \"surpassed\" the 76ers with their acquisitions of Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday, respectively.\n\"You can do whatever you want off the court,\" Embiid said, \"but you still gotta go out there and put the ball in the hoop. I believe that any team that I'm on, we're always going to have a chance.\"\nNo one had any idea when Harden would return.\nInstead, those questions were met with shrugs or hope that last year's NBA assists leader would return to the fold.\n\"That ain't for me to answer,\" 76ers forward P.J. Tucker said. \"I hope they figure it out soon. But if not, it's going to be what it's going to be.\"\nUnlike the Ben Simmons situation two years ago, there is seemingly no animosity between Harden and his teammates, which is partly why the 76ers believe there's a path to him returning to the court. The fact there's no obvious trade partner for Harden doesn't hurt, either.\nBut it's also clear that, without Harden, the 76ers have little chance of keeping up with the East's elite. It's a task that will be difficult even if he does eventually rejoin Philadelphia's ranks.\n-- Tim Bontemps\n\nLess than a week after being traded for the first time in his 11-year NBA career, reality was still setting in for Damian Lillard, the Milwaukee Buck.\nBut it was easy for him to get excited about his new running mate, two-time MVP and 2021 Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, and all the ways they would make life easier for each other on the court. It's the first time either player, both named to the NBA's list of the top 75 players of all time, will play alongside another superstar.\n\"My whole career has been off-the-dribble 3s, pick-and-roll pull-up 3s, contested [shots]. Double-teamed. Trapped,\" Lillard said. \"I'm curious to see how that can be possible with a player as dominant as [Antetokounmpo] is. I'm excited for an opportunity to play with him. I'm excited for the opportunity to be freed up and the opportunity to have more space and opportunity to play. It's going to be fun.\"\nThe gang takes their first group photo 📸 pic.twitter.com/sIDCbBZmCk\nLillard and Antetokounmpo have long admired each other from afar -- Antetokounmpo made Lillard the No.1 pick during the 2023 All-Star draft -- but what struck them both following their first phone conversation after the trade was how similar their personalities were.\nAntetokounmpo said it was like they were both the same person, if different sizes.\nSo even though this pairing comes with heightened expectations, both stars are approaching the season in similar fashion.\n\"We got to stay locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be so much hype around us, lot more TV games, lot of conversation about us. But at the end of the day, you don't win a championship by making a move.\"\nAdded Lillard: \"It made me feel good to see that he thinks that way.\"\n-- Jamal Collier\n\nThe Celtics spent the past three months getting used to a new normal. There was a total change in locker room voices with Marcus Smart and Grant Williams departing. Joe Mazzulla replaced most of his coaching staff. The arrival of Kristaps Porzingis was a planned adjustment to playing with two big men on the floor most of the time.\nThen, boom, Jrue Holiday got traded 24 hours before the start of media day and the snow globe was shaken up again. Down the line, Celtics players were excited about the deal and praised what they know about Holiday, but there was no doubt the team was a little rocked by the adjustment to the adjustment.\nFor example, guard Derrick White talked about how new assistant coach Sam Cassell came to Colorado this summer to spend some time getting to know him and preparing him for taking over as starting point guard -- and then Boston acquired a new All-Star point guard.\nPorzingis had been in Boston for two weeks working out and getting to know big man Robert Williams III, a defensive anchor whom Porzingis was preparing to play a lot with -- and now will not.\n\"I already could see how Rob is that charismatic guy for this group,\" he said. \"So it definitely hurts for this organization that he's not here anymore.\"\nMazzulla doesn't seem sure what his starting lineup or his rotations will be yet. The team has two roster spots open and is now hunting for another player, likely a big man. Holiday is living out of a suitcase.\nThe Celtics have great promise, but this might take a little time.\n-- Brian Windhorst\n\nSince 1999, the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers have shared the same downtown venue -- formerly Staples Center, currently Crypto.com Arena. But that partnership ends after this season, as the Clippers' new arena, the Intuit Dome located in Inglewood, is slated to open just before the 2024-25 season. Clippers star Paul George, for one, is eager for the switch.\n\"Yeah, I'm ready for us to have our own space,\" he said during Clippers media day Monday. \"I think I can speak to the whole [team] of saying we're tired of all these early games, and so it'd be nice [for] the schedule be a little bit in our favor.\"\nGeorge was referencing how the Clippers are often described as the \"third tenant\" at Crypto.com Arena, behind the Lakers and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, meaning that their schedule has often been sorted out after those of the other teams, which has led to plenty of early-morning tipoffs in the Clippers' schedule. (In 2016, ESPN reported that the Clippers' lease agreement meant that they not only have a lesser say in scheduling but receive a smaller share of proceeds from suites and club seats than the Lakers and Kings.)\nPouring the concrete floor 💪Over 20,000 sq. feet of concrete has been poured to lay the foundation for Intuit Dome's main basketball court and floor pic.twitter.com/yeQpo6I9iA\nClippers players and coaches have railed about this arrangement for years. That said, George said it has been a pleasure to play in Crypto.com Arena, given that it's the same building where Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, whom George admired for years, once played.\n\"It's been awesome, but that was short-lived,\" he said. \"Now, that I've been here for a couple of years, [I'm] not looking forward to the early games. So, again, it'd be nice to have our own space next year.\"\n-- Baxter Holmes\n\nDerrick Rose delivered a simple message during a recent conversation with Ja Morant:\n\"I'm not here to babysit you. I'm not here to follow you around. I'm not here to cheerlead. ... I'm here to push you.\"\nRose's potential to serve as a mentor to Morant, who will practice and travel with the team while serving a 25-game suspension to start the season, was among the factors that made him attractive to the Grizzlies. The 34-year-old Rose has a résumé that commands respect -- highlighted by the 2010-11 MVP award -- and a level of wisdom gained through a 15-year career that has featured plenty of trials and tribulations, both on and off the court.\nBut Rose didn't sign a veteran's deal to return to Memphis, where he played his lone college season before getting selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 draft, to assume the responsibility of preventing Morant from sabotaging his career with continued off-court foolishness.\nGrizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman speaks about the significance of Ja Morant being allowed to travel with the team during his 25-game suspension.\nHe's happy to give advice if Morant is willing to hear it -- such as emphasizing the importance of having the \"discipline to remind yourself or be mindful of the places you're at, who you're with and your actions\" -- but Rose's focus is on the basketball floor.\nRose, who played only 27 games for the New York Knicks last season, believes he still has \"a lot left in the tank\" and looks forward to being able to prove it. He will have a chance to get significant minutes with the Grizzlies, especially early in the season while Morant is unavailable. Rose also anticipates being able to help Morant rise to new levels as a point guard whose high-flying style is reminiscent of Rose's before his career-altering knee injury. \"I'm very fortunate to be in this situation where a lot of people look at his game, they kind of compare our games together, but he's on a whole another level,\" Rose said. \"So really seeing that it's our job to push him and let him know in times whenever he's being reckless to calm down.\"\nA few seconds later, Rose interrupted another question with a clarification: \"When we saying reckless, I'm talking about on the court, guys. On the court.\"\n-- Tim MacMahon\n\nAfter countless hours spent this summer working out alongside LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura was a little taken aback when he saw how small he looked compared to James when the team posted snapshots on social media.\n\"My weight was fine,\" Hachimura said with a chuckle at the Lakers' annual media day Monday. \"But they put the picture next to [LeBron].\" While Hachimura admitted that his body might be more \"defined\" since we last saw him in May when the Lakers were being swept out of the Western Conference finals by the Denver Nuggets, he is planning to punish opponents in the paint much the same way James has mastered.\n\"I just watched him closely and he taught me a lot of little tricks, pointers, the footwork.\" Hachimura said of the joint workouts organized by Lakers assistant coach Phil Handy.\nAs the 38-year-old James enters his 21st season, some drop-off in production from the lofty standard he has set for himself is expected, if not inevitable. But by pouring his knowledge into Hachimura in the summertime, it could mean Hachimura will be better equipped to support him as a teammate during the season.\n\"I see a lot in him,\" James said of Hachimura. \"I call him my Daniel-san and I'm Mr. Miyagi. And I call him my understudy.\"\nHachimura already showed signs of being ready for a starring role last postseason. He opened up the playoffs with 29 points on 11-for-14 shooting against the Grizzlies to help L.A. steal Game 1 of their first-round series on the road.\nHe stayed hot through L.A.'s playoff run, averaging 12.2 points on 55.7/48.7/88.2 shooting splits -- a significant uptick from his efficiency during the regular season after being acquired in a trade with the Washington Wizards in January.\nNow armed with a three-year, $51 million contract extension signed in the offseason, Hachimura is ready for more with the Lakers. Be it as a starter, as James' backup or whatever else he's asked to do -- like when he played some minutes at the 5 against Nikola Jokic in the Denver series.\n\"Playing time is more important for me,\" Hachimura said, \"and I want to finish the game. That's my main thing. And whatever the coaches decide, I'm here for it.\"\n-- Dave McMenamin\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray sat down, reunited not only with each other after the shortest offseason of their pro careers but also with the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\nIt didn't take the Nuggets stars long to get on the same wavelength yet again.\n\"I just think we can do it again,\" Murray said.\nJokic later added: \"Like Jamal said, why not win again?\"\nRepeating will be even more difficult for Jokic and Murray than bringing Denver its first NBA title. Not only have other contenders like Milwaukee, Phoenix and Boston reloaded, but Denver will have to offset its own locker room losses.\nNuggets head coach Michael Malone has sky-high expectations for Jamal Murray entering the 2023-24 season 🌟 #NBAMediaDay pic.twitter.com/Tt45GngfDs\nAlready, coach Michael Malone has challenged his two stars. He wants to see Jokic and Murray take \"ownership\" of the team with vocal vets like Jeff Green and Ish Smith gone.\nAnd he wants to see Murray take his postseason tear and apply it to the entire upcoming regular season and become a first-time All-Star and All-NBA performer. Murray averaged 26.1 points, 7.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds and shot 39.6% from 3 last postseason.\nIf his two stars do that, Malone might find himself trying to top his parade performance next June.\n\"Last season is over,\" Malone said. \"If we're serious about being a team that can repeat, if we're serious about trying to be a team that can be a dynasty, we have to bring our best every single day starting [Tuesday] in practice.\"\n-- Ohm Youngmisuk\n\nAfter a league-worst 17-65 finish last season, Detroit Pistons GM Troy Weaver says he feels the team is \"ready to go\" and compete for a playoff spot.\nWeaver says \"there was never any excuses\" for the lack of success, but he feels like the Pistons are better with the addition of new head coach Monty Williams and the return of former No. 1 pick Cade Cunningham, who missed all but a dozen games last season after undergoing surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left leg.\nA special message from Deuce! pic.twitter.com/ppdIsCSXin\nWhile examining the Eastern Conference landscape in the aftermath of the star player movement such as Lillard's trade to Milwaukee, Weaver doesn't feel that changes the goal in Detroit, which is to return to basketball relevance after finishing .500 or worse in seven consecutive seasons.\n\"I like what Boston and Milwaukee and the rest of those teams do. That's more fuel to what we're trying to do. Realistic goal for our team? Is to play 82 meaningful games,\" Weaver said during media day.\n\"We want to go down to the wire every game with us playing for something. We don't want to just look at the last 25 games and not be in contention. We want to be in contention for 82 games, the entire season.\"\n-- Eric Woodyard\n\nOn the final day the San Antonio Spurs occupied their old facility on 1 Spurs Lane, about a dozen fans stood outside the players exit hoping for an autograph. They were holding the typical items you'd see, such as basketballs and jerseys.\nBut with 2023 No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama in town, there was a new offering awaiting Wembanyama's signature: a 6-foot green inflatable alien wearing a black Spurs Wembanyama jersey.\nWembanyama, who LeBron James called \"an alien\" last year and who Nike dubbed \"The Extraterrestrial\" in a new ad, has taken San Antonio by storm ever since the Spurs won the draft lottery in May.\nSpurs rookie Victor Wembanyama discusses how he's prepared for his first season in the league and what he's looking forward to most in the NBA.\nThere are murals going up around town, including one Wembanyama posed in front of in his latest Instagram post in which he declares himself a \"Certified San Antonian.\"\n\"Man, it's just been so comfortable to have people welcome you like this, and I'm very thankful,\" Wembanyama said Monday. \"I'm a very lucky, lucky human.\"\nNot only has Wembanyama started to acclimate himself to his new city, but he also has done so with his new teammates.\n\"We often have team dinners and team meetings, so I'm really glad everything's happening the way it's happening,\" Wembanyama said. \"And yes, as I was saying, I feel very lucky. I know I'm in a good environment from every aspect.\"\n-- Andrew Lopez\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have become synonymous with small ball, and with the addition of guard Chris Paul and the possibility he could be a starter, the Warriors could have the smallest starting lineup in the NBA.\nThat being said, would they want more options with size? Draymond Green has heard that before.\n\"They said we didn't have enough size in 2022, and we won,\" Green said Monday. \"I've been told I wasn't the right size forever, and I've won. ...\n\"I can show you where we didn't have enough size and we won. In saying that, I'm not totally against having another big.\"\nThe Warriors brought in Dwight Howard for a set of workouts a few weeks ago, but nothing materialized. Golden State did add Usman Garuba on a two-way contract and Rudy Gay on a non-guaranteed training camp deal to add some more size.\nChris Paul says he'll do \"whatever to help our team win\" as he heads into his first season with the Warriors.\nThe two players will surely get more run time in the preseason with Green sidelined for at least the next two weeks with a left ankle sprain -- but the Warriors still don't have a traditional center to back up Kevon Looney.\n\"At the end of the day, I think [Warriors GM] Mike Dunleavy has done an incredible job of filling impossible shoes,\" Green said. \"The No. 1 thing that Mike has to do is come in and create trust with every move that he's been making and moves that he hasn't made. But communicating with us and making sure we're in the know -- that we know certain things -- is incredible.\"\nGreen reiterated the Warriors don't need another big, stating anything they need they already have. But he had a small caveat:\n\"[The] Lakers are huge. That's who we lost to. So if you look at someone and you're like, 'This is who we lost to, where do we need to improve?' Probably need a little bit more size. Doesn't mean we're necessarily going to lose again if we don't get the size. But it may help.\"\n-- Kendra Andrews"}

But Lynch bluntly said he isn't the right person to ask due to his relationship with both parties.\nA post shared by ESPN (@espn)\nCandidly, Lynch said he respects Wilson as a player and a teammate.\n\"I'll take Russ and I'll put him at quarterback and I'll rock with him because I've done that,\" he said.\nBut, according to Lynch, anything he says might be taken with malice because of the fallout from the goal-line interception Wilson threw in Super Bowl XLIX that led to the Seahawks' 28-24 defeat to the New England Patriots and contributed to Wilson's eventual departure for the Denver Broncos. In terms of a relationship, Lynch said, he and Wilson didn't have one off the field.\n\"Can't pick up the phone or call old boy or nothing,\" Lynch said.\nThe aftermath of a game against the Tennessee Titans in 2013 stood out to Lynch when reflecting on his relationship with Wilson.\nLynch said the Titans didn't have a good secondary at the time; therefore, the plan was to exploit the pass defense. Wilson didn't have the game that he wanted, throwing for 257 yards and no touchdowns.\nAccording to Lynch, he asked the team's player personnel staff for Wilson's number to offer support. The staff member promised to look into it and later called Lynch back to see if he got a call from Wilson. Lynch responded that he hadn't spoken with Wilson, but he had received a phone call with caller ID blocked.\n\"I don't know how or why [it was blocked], but I just know I got a call from a blocked number,\" Lynch said.\nLynch and Wilson eventually spoke, but the conversation didn't go the way Lynch expected. He said he tried to let Wilson know he \"had his back,\" but Wilson's response surprised Lynch.\n\"Considering that [we're] on the same team, going for the same goal and this is how you chose to respond to me,\" he recalled. \"It was more so like, maybe you don't understand what I'm saying?\"\nLater in the podcast, Lynch cited preferential treatment from Carroll to Wilson as a reason for tension within the team. \"You're kind of putting him on a pedestal or outside the box,\" Lynch said. \"And it's like he doesn't have to be held accountable to the same s--- that we do.\"\nLynch and Wilson were teammates in Seattle for four full seasons, winning Super Bowl XLVIII. Lynch briefly returned to the Seahawks in 2019 for one game.\nWilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 after 10 years with the Seahawks."}

{"title": "Experts: What Brett Favre faces in lawsuit deposition", "date": "2023-10-05 11:58:53", "text": "On the one-year anniversary of Brett Favre being named in a civil suit, here's a look back at the Hall of Famer's involvement in the largest welfare scandal in the history of the state. (3:15)\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services filed notice this week of its intent to depose former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. More than a year ago, Favre was named as one of dozens of defendants in a civil lawsuit that aims to recover tens of millions of dollars in welfare funds a state audit said were misspent. Favre has denied any wrongdoing in the welfare case and has not been criminally charged.\nThe deposition, scheduled for Oct. 26, would be Favre's first time testifying under oath in this case, according to Front Office Sports. The people involved in the case aren't commenting because of a judge's gag order, but several unaffiliated attorneys explained what could happen when Favre arrives at the deposition in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where Favre starred for the University of Southern Mississippi.\nESPN spoke with William W. Berry III, a law professor at the University of Mississippi; Vangela M. Wade, an attorney and leader of the Mississippi Center for Justice; and Matthew Leish, a partner at the law firm Miller Korzenik Sommers Rayman in New York. The legal experts addressed, among other things, the risks that Favre potentially faces during the deposition process, and what he could do to help his case. All three said they do not know details of the case beyond what has been reported and would speak about general legal strategies. Here are their responses, which have been edited for clarity.\nWhat does it mean to be deposed?\nBerry: The idea of a deposition is to get someone's story on the record so that, at trial, they can't change it later. And so it'll obviously be very important for Brett Favre to tell the truth. This is his chance to get his story on the record.\nWade: In any deposition, it's part of discovery, of getting information directly from that person that they're deposing, or having that person to identify documents during the course of that deposition.\nLeish: There are really two goals. One, it's fact gathering. They're trying to find out what this person knows. The second part of it is to try to pin him down to get some admissions that will hurt his case. It can't be a complete fishing expedition, but they have some leeway to explore.\nHow long do depositions last?\nWade: I've seen depositions go anywhere from an hour to three days or longer for one person. It depends on the nature of the litigation and what the party is attempting to cover in that deposition.\nBerry: Most depositions are usually one-day depositions, maybe eight hours. In a more complicated case, it might take longer.\nWhat kinds of risks does Favre face during the deposition?\nLeish: The biggest danger is that he says something under oath that really helps the state prove its case. Maybe he admits something that they're trying to prove or he says something and they can call him out on it and it makes him look like he's not credible. I think those are the two biggest risks.\nHow can a deposition be used as evidence in a potential trial?\nBerry: If the plaintiffs in the case were to call Mr. Favre to testify and then he were to change his story on the stand, you would then cite him back to his deposition and impeach him in court. An impeachment is really showing someone's changing their story and then the credibility that person has with a jury or a judge is shot.\nWhat would help Favre in his deposition?\nLeish: When you're the person being deposed, it's really defensive. You're trying not to give the other side anything they can use. It's not so much that you're trying to prove your case. So his main goal is don't hurt yourself.\nBut having said that, if his testimony is very consistent with what he's saying -- \"I didn't do anything wrong, here's what I knew\" -- and he backs that up, he's got real evidence to support that, it can be useful to him. And the state can say, \"Hold on a second here, maybe we have a problem. Maybe we're going to have a hard time proving our case.\"\nBerry: What discovery is, is really a negotiation on some level in the sense of each party is trying to marshal, each lawyer is trying to figure out the best they can what really happened. So often you see these disputes in the media and you have the \"he said and she said,\" but then you start drilling down and you look at the actual evidence in the case and what evidence do you have and putting the evidence together.\nThen you get a sense of, \"Wow, this person really did something they weren't supposed to.\" Or alternatively, \"The allegation, it looked that way, but this person actually didn't do anything wrong.\""}
{"title": "Untold stories of the Air Raid revolution, from pregame hot dogs to Phil Collins photo ops", "date": "2023-10-05 12:16:40", "text": "Long before the world knew Mike Leach or Dana Holgorsen or any of the other oddballs, eccentrics and revolutionaries of the Air Raid fraternity, Hal Mumme was a high school coach in Copperas Cove, Texas, with a problem.\nIt was 1986, the NBA and a young superstar had captured the attention of the school's best athletes. Even Mumme's own son came home from school one day and announced he wanted to be Michael Jordan.\nThis was Texas, and most coaches still romanticized the notion that football had to be torture for it to be worthwhile. There was a machismo to the running game, ramming head-on into each other and surviving battles of attrition, with defenses built around big, physical players meant to win those battles.\n\"My generation's football coaches fought World War II,\" Mumme said, \"and they were pretty damn determined to make us relive it every day in practice.\"\nSo Mumme, who had already gone from being the nation's youngest coordinator at UTEP at 27, was now 31, looking to reboot his career after the Miners' whole staff had been fired, and he had a wild idea. What if he made football fun? What if he actually used the entire field?\nAnd so the beginnings of the Air Raid were born, 67 miles away from Austin, where just 10 years before, Texas coach Darrell Royal was running the wishbone and repeating his maxim: \"Three things can happen to you whenever you throw the football, and two of 'em are bad.\" But Mumme, who idolized Royal, realized that the same thing that made the wishbone work, spreading the ball in space to skilled athletes, might work even better as a passing offense. So he went all-in.\nA decade later, Mumme burst onto the national scene at Kentucky, walking around on SEC fields, eating hot dogs, wearing flip-flops and listening to Jimmy Buffet before becoming the only UK coach in the past 100 years to beat Alabama. His creation made 5-9 slot receivers superstars and walk-on quarterbacks Heisman winners. Mumme made it possible for Mike Leach, a lawyer from Pepperdine, to become a college football icon, for Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech walk-on himself from tiny Muleshoe, Texas, to lead two of the most storied programs in history. He made football interesting for unpedigreed coaches who loved the sport, but who would rather write books about Geronimo than sleep in their offices or run the damn ball.\n\"The Air Raid is not an offense,\" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"The Air Raid is a way of life.\"\n\"It's a mentality,\" Riley said, \"more than a collection of plays.\"\nThese mavericks changed the course of football history and rewrote record books, paving the way for Patrick Mahomes to win two Super Bowls while forcing Bill Belichick and Nick Saban to give into wide-open passing attacks. How they did it was never boring.\nLast year, Dykes, a former Mumme assistant at Kentucky, made a historic run to the national title game after a 5-7 season. This year Deion Sanders, who used to pick Mumme's brain and called Leach for offensive staff recommendations, is using the same wide-open principles at Colorado during its program jump-start, turning his own son, Shedeur, into a Heisman candidate at QB.\nWith the sport still mourning Leach, the most famous and revered coach in the extended Air Raid family, following his death in December, we set out to find tales from the rise of the game-changing offense that illustrate the methods behind their collective madness.\nFor every Tim Couch or Kyler Murray or Caleb Williams, the bluest of blue-chip prospects, there are dozens of record-setting Air Raid quarterbacks who were unwanted by anyone else, then ran up the gaudiest of numbers.\nDustin Dewald blazed the trail in Copperas Cove. He was one of those players who got disillusioned with the drudgery of football in the 1980s, so he quit to join the golf team after watching his older brother get pummeled over and over as their QB.\n\"We got our heads kicked in trying to run the ball down the throats of bigger, more powerful teams, lining up in the Power I with an offensive line that averaged 195 pounds,\" Dewald said. \"It was just ridiculous. Hal came in and said, 'All that's going to change.' It did. I think it was the first time in 10 years we didn't have a losing season in Cove.\"\nBetween 1978 and 1985, Cove went 10-69, including two 0-10 seasons. In Mumme's first year in 1986, the Bulldogs went 5-5. They were still outmanned, but Mumme, who began by using the run and shoot, gave them a shot in every game. Then against district rival Georgetown, the opposing coach, Art Briles, blitzed Mumme relentlessly, making it difficult for more complex plays to develop.\n\"I decided I was never going to let that happen to me again,\" Mumme said, reducing his offense to a collection of short passes and horizontal crossing routes.\nDewald threw the ball more than all but a handful of schools in Texas that year. There had been only two scholarship players in the previous 10 years at Cove, but he signed with Stephen F. Austin. Then, he went through the same cycle, quitting due to boredom and joining the golf team at Tarleton State. There weren't any college teams he knew of where he could replicate his experience. Until he went home to Cove to visit.\nHe stopped by the football offices to congratulate Mumme on his new job he'd just landed at a small college, Iowa Wesleyan. By the time he left, Mumme had once again recruited him to play quarterback for a team that was similar to Sanders' Colorado experiment: IWU was coming off an 0-10 season and had just two players returning.\n\"We tried to have a team meeting after I got introduced at the press conference and they told me there were going to be 40 guys,\" Mumme said. \"I walk in, there's two, and the three that I brought with me. I just gave 'em the same speech I was going to give 'em anyway about working hard in the offseason, and we're going to win games. One kid just got up and walked out. I guess he decided, 'This is bulls---, I'm not doing this.' So we had four.\"\nLeach was one of only two applicants for Mumme's offensive coordinator job, and they quickly realized they were kindred spirits. It was a leap of faith: The high school coach took a $20,000 pay cut to try to prove himself in college again. The lawyer who could've made $200,000 a year instead was making $12,000, and the golfer took on student-loan debt to go to school in Iowa -- where none of them had ever been.\nThey went 7-4 the next year, then, by 1991, started tinkering and added the up-tempo element where they never huddled and ran plays at a frenetic pace. Opposing teams had never seen anything like it and had no idea how to stop it. In Dewald's accidental career, he threw for 12,045 yards, 115 TDs and set 25 NAIA records. He threw for 4,418 yards and 45 TDs in 1991, including one game where he set national records with 86 attempts and 61 completions. Leach sent out press releases to national media, coining the name \"Air Raid\" in the process and building the mystique.\nWhile it may have appeared the gaudy numbers were because of an intricate playbook, it was actually the opposite. There was no playbook at all. The philosophy was making things as barebones as possible.\nDon't practice plays you won't call in a game. Don't call plays in a game you don't practice. Don't throw to a covered receiver and don't pass up an open one.\nThe plays came from LaVell Edwards at BYU, with Mumme saying he's watched every offensive snap of Edwards' career. He picked his favorites -- four passing and two rushing -- that seemed to always work. His practice drills, the real backbone of the Air Raid, according to the coaches, were all about details of that limited set, and were all based on Bill Walsh's 49ers practices.\nSo he made every practice consistent and repetitive and drilled until they were mind-numbingly boring. Do it until you can't screw it up, and let muscle memory win. And if it works, keep doing it. Mumme said he once called the same play 52 times in a game for Dewald.\nDecades after helping launch the revolution, Dewald has watched teammates like Bill Bedenbaugh, an Iowa Wesleyan offensive linemen who's now considered one of the best O-line coaches in the country at Oklahoma, along with Holgorsen, his old IWU wide receiver who's become another of the sport's most idiosyncratic coaches, and he finds it amusing that he still understands almost everything they do.\n\"For years, I would go visit [Leach or Mumme] every year for at least one home game and spend days with them at practice and on the sidelines of games,\" Dewald said. \"The last time I visited Mike at Washington State, I looked at the script for the game and it was crazy. I actually knew what to do on 90 percent of it -- and it was almost 30 years after I stopped playing. Just to see what they've all accomplished has been mind-blowing for me, how much it's changed the game and how successful they've all been has been, really, cool to watch.\"\nChris Hatcher is convinced Mumme isn't the inventor of the Air Raid. He claims the title.\nHatcher signed at Valdosta State to play for Mike Cavan, a former Georgia assistant who had coached under Vince Dooley and was Herschel Walker's lead recruiter. They were an I-formation team with a few passing concepts.\nMumme arrived at Valdosta after Cavan left for another job and, armed with talent he'd never had before, he initially made the same mistake he criticized other coaches for: He overcomplicated things.\n\"I don't care what anybody says, I'm the guy that invented the Air Raid,\" Hatcher said. \"I was not smart enough to comprehend all this stuff Hal wanted to do. So we had to dummy it way down for me. And then that's when the Air Raid took off. That is the truth.\"\nHatcher learned to appreciate the beauty of perfecting and running an offense so simple that he had a little extra time on his hands, enough to visit a frat party the night before homecoming and leave with a parting gift.\n\"You didn't have to be in the film room all night because it didn't matter what the defense was doing,\" Hatcher said. \"We were so good at it that you had time to go out and steal a cannon in the evening. It was a legit Civil War cannon, now, too. Let's not act like it was a little peashooter.\"\nHatcher threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns and set 29 school records. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals, and when it was all said and done set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. He won the 1994 Harlon Hill Award, often called the D-II Heisman, as the Blazers went 40-17-1 in his career.\nThis captured the attention of Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton, who wanted to match the basketball program pace. He handpicked Mumme, which raised eyebrows among purists who believed such a gimmick offense wouldn't work in the big, bad SEC. But Kentucky already had a homegrown star quarterback in Tim Couch, albeit one who was last seen losing 65-0 in his first start to Florida -- and defensive coordinator Bob Stoops -- and attempted just 84 passes over seven games.\nFirst, Mumme enlisted Hatcher, now a graduate assistant, to convince Couch not to transfer. (They went to Hooters and talked it out.) He stuck around, working with Hatcher, who was in charge of getting Mumme's play scripts prepared for Couch's wristband. Mumme would say Play 1 or Play 2, and Couch would call what's on the wristband. Quarterbacks often would check into different plays freely, but in one game, Couch took it to an extreme.\n\"We get about three or four first downs and Couch ain't run a play Mumme's called yet,\" Hatcher said. \"We go down and score, and the whole time Mumme is on the headsets using a few choice words to me.\"\nMumme accused Hatcher, who often changed the play himself when playing for Mumme, of purposely telling Couch not to run Mumme's calls.\n\"I can't believe you'd do this to me,\" Mumme said, according to Hatcher. \"Then it finally hit me. Couch was using the wristband from the week before, and didn't change it out. Every play was wrong, and we went down and scored anyway. My point is, when you rep the plays so much, we feel like it doesn't matter. I can pick me a handful of plays that should work against just about anything you'll see. I like to say we're a well-coached backyard football team.\"\nCouch's mastery paid off in 1997 when he threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Craig Yeast in overtime to lead Kentucky to a win over Alabama 40-34. It was Kentucky's first win over Alabama in 75 years -- something the Wildcats haven't done since. It came just a year after Couch threw for 13 yards (UK had 67 total yards) in an entire game against Stoops' Florida defense under Steve Spurrier. Couch threw for 348 and 406 yards in the next two meetings. While the Gators ended up pulling away and winning both games handily, it was frustrating for Stoops, and their mentality impressed him.\n\"I liked how [Leach] and Hal Mumme were over there standing together,\" Stoops said. \"I took note of the casual nature of the two of them. But they were the most difficult to deal with.\"\nNothing Mumme did was by accident. He doesn't dispute any contentions that he and Leach were arrogant.\n\"There's no question,\" Mumme said. \"We always thought we were smarter than everybody else. We always thought we had better ideas than everybody else. And we pretty much did. That's why everybody's trying to do it now.\"\nMumme could be combative with reporters, and Leach could be aloof. And they weren't worried about too many other opinions.\n\"We played Jimmy Buffett during warmups,\" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown, who played wide receiver at Kentucky under Mumme. \"I don't know if that gets it going for you.\"\n\"It got me and Mike going,\" Mumme said, laughing. \"We weren't worried about anybody else.\"\nThey loved causing a stir or annoying other fans, like when Leach mocked Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets as head coach at rival Texas Tech.\n\"How come they get to pretend they are soldiers?\" Leach said. \"The thing is, they aren't actually in the military. I ought to have Mike's Pirate School. The freshmen, all they get is the bandanna. When you're a senior, you get the sword and skull and crossbones. For homework, we'll work pirate maneuvers and stuff like that.\"\nThe Aggies were not amused.\nThen again, Leach and Mumme were, which was the point. Jeff Allen can testify.\nBefore Allen became the only staff member that's been with Nick Saban for his entire Alabama tenure, a trusted confidante and sports medicine guru, he was an assistant trainer at Kentucky -- but most importantly, he was Mumme's hot dog guy.\nUK was about to play at LSU in Death Valley, then coached by embattled coach Gerry DiNardo. Mumme marched into the training room on Wednesday with a request that befuddled Allen.\n\"Hey, during pregame, when I'm talking to DiNardo, I want you to bring me a hot dog,\" Mumme said.\nAllen didn't understand. He'd been with him for more than five years at this point, and this was a new one.\n\"Finally, over the next day or two, I said, 'Why do you want a hot dog while you're on the field talking to their head coach?\" Allen said, \"He said, 'Because they're going to be so uptight to begin with. I want to show 'em how carefree and how relaxed I am, and it's going to make them even more nervous.'\"\nMumme was very specific that he wanted mustard on it. He sent a student for the hot dog and was on the field during pregame when he saw Mumme, who he hadn't talked to yet on the day of the game. He thought, \"well here goes nothing,\" and headed over.\n\"I looked at him and said, 'Coach, here's your hot dog,' Allen said. \"He looked at me and goes, 'Oh, thanks Jeff.' Then he said, 'Hey, hold on, hold on. Does it have mustard on it?'\" Allen assured him it did, all the while playing it straight.\n\"I can still see DiNardo's face,\" Allen said. \"He was like, 'What in the world is happening here?' And I swear to you, Hal just stood there talking and eating that hot dog. I walked off and I turned around and I wanted to see it again. And there they are talking and Hal is just chomping on a hotdog right there on the 50-yard line of Tiger Stadium. And our players were seeing it. They were laughing. They were dying during warmups watching it.\"\nThe Wildcats were 0-24 on the road against ranked teams since 1977. They were 9½-point underdogs. They played fast and loose and kicked a walk-off field goal to win at the buzzer 39-36, sealing one of the biggest wins in school history. It led Kentucky to a bid in the Outback Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl for the Wildcats since 1952.\n\"I'm not saying we won that game because of the hot dog,\" Allen said. \"But I don't think it hurt.\"\nOn Dec. 1, 1998, Oklahoma hired Stoops. The Sooners hadn't had a winning season in six years and were coming off a 12-22 stretch in three years under John Blake. Stoops, then 38, was a hot commodity as a defensive coordinator. Hiring someone to run his offense was his first big decision.\n\"My initial talks were with Turner Gill, who was at Nebraska at the time,\" Stoops said. \"That didn't really work out. And then I got to thinking. ... I didn't know [Leach], but the more I thought about it, the more I referred back to how challenging it was to handle Kentucky. If they can be that good at Kentucky, why couldn't we be as good or better at Oklahoma? So I went with it.\"\nIt was a bold move. Leach had never been a playcaller, and let's face it, he was pretty weird.\n\"I thought Mike was really interesting,\" Stoops said. \"Mike had a little different way of doing things. But let me tell you something: He was a hell of a leader. He was demanding, as aloof as he might be. He wanted things done a certain way and they damn sure better be done that way or you were going to hear it. He might look laid back, he was demanding, very demanding.\"\nThat was a learning curve for the rest of the staff, who couldn't figure out if this was all an act, or if Leach was for real.\n\"It was completely different from anything that any of us had seen in the offensive meeting room,\" former Oklahoma assistant and Kansas head coach Mark Mangino said. \"It did take time to get used to.\"\nSo did Leach's personality. The staff was all staying at a hotel in Norman, and somehow Mangino's room became the center of the action.\n\"I couldn't get him out of my room when I was living in the Residence Inn,\" Mangino said. \"Every night, somebody delivered a couple cases of beer, a box of cigars, and we sat around and called recruits till about 11:30.\"\nBy midnight, everyone was gone. Except Leach.\n\"Mike used to like to watch those simulcasts of Howard Stern. And those things would run till 4 in the morning. I'm in my bed trying to sleep. And here's Leach at 3 in the morning, he's laughing at Howard Stern, he's drinking a beer and he's having a good time.\"\nStoops, too, had a learning curve.\n\"I learned after the first few weeks late at night not to stop in and check in on Mike,\" Stoops said. \"One night, it's 11 or something, I'm ready to go home, and he starts telling me a story about Geronimo. After about 20 minutes, I said, 'Mike, I'm going home. I'm the head coach, I get to go when I want.'\"\nMangino, meanwhile, couldn't shake him at night, and he couldn't get through to him by day. In a staff meeting, Mangino suggested a running play. Leach couldn't have been less interested. Mangino suggested trying it at practice, and Leach blew him off again. Mangino said maybe he'll practice it anyway.\n\"Mike said, you could put it in all you want, you could run it during every play of inside drill, but I'm never going to call it in a game,\" and Mangino and Leach nearly came to blows, Stoops said, laughing.\nAn irritated Stoops called them into his office and made them hash it out. Stoops made it clear that he had given Leach full control, and they'd do it his way. Leach and Mangino became good friends.\nThe Big 12 was never the same. The new-look Sooners went 7-5 and made their first bowl game in five years. Texas Tech hired Leach, and Mangino took over, finally getting to put in a couple of wrinkles of his own.\nMangino had a season's worth of reps in place, and he said he ran about 80% of Leach's offense. \"And it worked,\" he said. The Sooners won a national championship, going 13-0 behind Josh Heupel, a lightly recruited junior college quarterback Leach found at Snow College.\nFrom the @kfor archives, Mike Leach at his last OU practice with Josh Heupel on Dec. 8, 1999. You can see the emotions as he talks with Heupel. Leach was introduced as the Texas Tech head coach the next day. pic.twitter.com/xm65rAhAes\n\"They were the ones that invented it ... but we [Oklahoma, Leach, Texas Tech and the Big 12] were the ones to make it popular,\" Stoops said. \"They weren't getting the national attention at Kentucky until we started it. And then, of course, we kept it and won the national championship.\"\nLeach became a star at Texas Tech. He took down No. 1 Texas, guided the Red Raiders to a bowl game in all 10 of his seasons and finished as the program's all-time winningest coach at 84-43.\nDykes was part of Leach's first staff that replaced his dad, Spike Dykes, who had retired.\n\"We were doing all this stuff that was really analytics, but they didn't know it was,\" Dykes said. \"We were going for it all the time on fourth down or going for it in our own territory. My dad would be like, 'What the hell are you doing?' I'm like, 'It gives us a chance to beat Texas. Instead of losing by 14, we might lose by 50. But we also might win?'\"\nIt became one of the most influential eras in college football. In Mumme's days in Kentucky, Urban Meyer and Sean Payton were among the earliest coaches to visit to try to learn what the Air Raid is all about. In Lubbock, Leach made sure his doors were wide open, and there were visitors everywhere.\nLeach made sure his coaches knew that he wanted them to teach visitors anything they wanted to know.\nThere was only one issue: \"They didn't believe us,\" said Lincoln Riley, who was a student assistant for Leach, because the entire offense was so simple.\n\"I've never been to a place where you had more coaches around constantly,\" Riley said. \"Mike was so open to people coming in. You think just Texas high school coaches? No. I'm talking professional coaches, college coaches from all around the country, high school coaches from all around the country, every single year. There's a group from Japan that came, groups from England that came over, I mean, you name it, we had 'em.\"\nDykes and Holgorsen, who were receivers coaches and later co-offensive coordinators, would handle a lot of high school coaches on their visits. Dykes said he can remember walking out to the parking lot one day and overhearing the coaches leaving convinced the offense couldn't be that simple, that Leach & Co. were holding things back.\n\"'Those sumb------ wouldn't tell us anything,'\" Dykes recalled them saying. \"And we told them everything.\"\nMuleshoe High's David Wood coached Riley and his brother Garrett Riley, now the offensive coordinator at Clemson, and watched as they passed over small-school offers to head to Lubbock to learn from Leach. Over time, he said, you could see the Tech influence take hold and spread throughout high school football, with Muleshoe being one of the early adopters, because Lincoln returned to help him install it while he was still a walk-on quarterback at Tech.\n\"We were a run offense, but once we realized how simple it was, we didn't think it was going to be that hard to switch,\" Wood said. \"We used to run maybe 30 plays in practice because you analyze every play and tell every player what they did wrong and then you'd run the play again and make sure everyone did it right. The way Leach did it, when we watched it, you got to coach on the run. So we were able to get like 120 plays a practice instead of 30 plays a practice.\"\nWood said when Riley set out for Lubbock in 2002, there were maybe two schools in the Texas Panhandle that were running a spread offense.\n\"I would say probably 70 percent of the teams we played when I retired [in 2017] were running it,\" he said. \"Maybe 80.\"\nThe Big 12 became known for its shootouts, and Leach's earliest quarterback rooms were filled with future stars and coaches, all of whom waited their turn, many of them just to start for one season. Kliff Kingsbury, who had originally signed with Spike Dykes, threw for more than 5,000 yards as a senior in 2002 and set seven NCAA records in his three years as a starter at Tech. His backup, B.J. Symons, set the NCAA passing record with 5,833 yards in 2003, and Symons' backups, Sonny Cumbie and Cody Hodges, each passed for more than 4,000 yards in a season as starters.\nThey did it all because Leach repeated the same things he and Mumme had always preached, particularly in the film room.\n\"The worst coaching point he would ever give us, and the one that we all hated, was: 'This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy wasn't open. And he's the one guy you threw it to!\" said Cumbie, now the head coach at Louisiana Tech, imitating Leach's monotone cadence. \"I don't care if it's two-high [safety coverage], one-high. Is it man? Is it zone? Is this guy open? Yes. Throw it to him.\"\nMumme's Kentucky era ended in an NCAA investigation, with Mumme resigning in 2001 amid findings that an assistant coach was sending money orders to players in Memphis. Mumme was cited for a \"failure to monitor,\" but was not punished by the NCAA.\nSince then, he'll sign up to coach anything, anytime, anywhere, including stops at New Mexico State, reviving football after 20 years at Southeastern Louisiana or stops at Division III schools Belhaven in Mississippi and McMurry in Texas.\n\"I'm the Johnny Appleseed of football,\" Mumme said. \"I always thought that was a great story. It's not that I set out to do that -- I never set out to get kicked out of Kentucky -- but when you look back on it, providence had a plan. We spread it a whole lot of places it wouldn't have been otherwise.\"\nAnd despite his offense being almost the norm now, rather than catching teams by surprise, it still works as it was intended: As a sort of money ball, beating teams that you have no business beating.\nAt McMurry, he took over a program that had three winless seasons in the previous decade, including an 0-10 mark the year before he arrived. Three years later, they were 9-3 and 7-1 in the conference.\nOut of the spotlight, Mumme still made history. And he did it in the most Mumme way possible.\nMcMurry opened the 2011 season with an 82-6 loss to Stephen F. Austin, who was ranked in the FCS at the time. After getting down early, Mumme would just keep going for it on fourth down over and over. He was down 35-0 at halftime, and it only got worse from there. But he wouldn't stop.\n\"Losing by 50 was the same as losing by 1,\" Dykes said. \"Hal never cared.\"\nThe next week, Mumme gave the team four days off. He showed them five plays from the first half where it easily could've been 35-28 instead of 35-0. They were set to face UTSA the next week, a D-I team coached by Larry Coker, who'd won a national championship at Miami. Mumme's quarterback, Jake Mullin, like Dewald, wasn't on the team when he arrived. He played baseball, but was a quarterback on the intramural team when Mumme found him.\n\"They said they created this offense for teams without much talent, which was great for us,\" Mullin said, who, like Dewald, ended up throwing for more than 12,000 yards in his career. \"Whenever [Mumme] got there, there was not much there. I mean, I remember I was bigger than my left guard.\"\nMumme took the team to the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, his favorite place, where Teddy Roosevelt recruited Texans at the bar to serve in his Rough Riders. He took the team on a tour of the Alamo the night before the game. The next day, McMurry upset UTSA 24-21 in front of 31,000 fans in the Alamodome, one of the only upsets of a D-I team by a D-III team in history, and Mullin threw for 372 yards.\n\"The Menger's filled with ghosts, we did have a ghost sighting in there,\" Mumme said. \"Between the Menger ghosts and the Alamo ghosts, they probably helped us out.\"\nMumme's fascination with history earned him an invitation from then-McMurry professor Don Frazier to a party for his new book, \"The Alamo and Beyond.\" Also invited? One of the world's largest collectors of Alamo memorabilia in the world: Phil Collins. Yes, that Phil Collins.\nFrazier didn't want Collins to be constantly accosted at the event, so he invited Mumme because he said half the table of Texans would rather talk to Mumme about the Air Raid and Leach than to a British rock star. Even about the Alamo.\nMumme got his copy autographed by Collins. The inscription reads:\n\"To coach... Something's in the air tonight. Cheers. Phil Collins.\"\nMumme, 71, keeps spreading the gospel. He is part of the operations group of a new spring league called the International Football Alliance with teams in Mexico and Texas, and will coach one of the teams. His son, Matt, who never became Michael Jordan, instead stuck with the family business and is now the assistant head coach at Colorado State.\nMumme has seen his little creation change the sport, including watching some of the most storied running teams of his lifetime at USC and Oklahoma be completely transformed. Now, it's finally broken through to the final frontier: the Big Ten, where Wisconsin, under Leach acolyte Phil Longo, is following the same formula as Oklahoma: Join forces with a defensive head coach (Luke Fickell) and flip the offense. Harrell, the former Leach quarterback, is the new offensive coordinator at Purdue as well.\n\"A couple of days before Mike passed, we talked and he was just ultra excited that we're bringing the Air Raid to the Big Ten,\" Longo said. \"It's the most excited I've ever heard him. So it meant something to me that he was happy that we were making moves, and he's the only one who didn't seem shocked by it.\"\nMason Miller, Leach's offensive line coach at Mississippi State who is now the offensive coordinator at Tarleton State, has worked for either Mumme or Leach basically since 1994 when he played running back at Valdosta State. He said the Air Raid family has become so big that it has its share of \"little sibling rivalries,\" but that when they all get together, \"we're like magnets to each other.\"\nLeach's loss has been profound on the family. But out of that loss, there's a new beginning.\nLeach's son Cody spent two years as a volunteer coach at BYU under Kalani Sitake, and spent his dad's final year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State. Now, he's an assistant special teams coach for the Bulldogs, who has completed his Air Raid certification -- a service Mumme offers to keep spreading the word to coaches anywhere -- and is studying his dad's old game tapes stored in Gatorade coolers in his garage.\n\"I wish I could have gotten more time with him,\" Cody, 27, said. \"But Dad being so famous, being on TV, the occasional 'Friday Night Lights' cameo and other random stuff in media, I can always find him. Not everyone has that kind of opportunity where your parent is so well-documented that you can just find them and pull them up anytime.\"\nThere's another Mumme-Leach pairing in the works, with Cody hoping to follow his father's path.\n\"He knew so many other amazing coaches and all the guys he knows, I've known for a long time too,\" Cody said. \"So I have plenty of people to be able to talk to. His was the first generation, and it's kind of taking off into other branches. For me, it's a legacy.\"\nStoops says he can't help but look around and see how profound their impact was.\n\"It goes back to Mike,\" he said. \"And Hal's not talked enough about. He and Mike were joined at the hip. Between the two of them, I don't know that anyone's had a stronger influence on coaches. It goes on and on. The influence is huge. These tentacles from them go all over the place. They branch out from the two of them everywhere.\"\nJake Trotter and Chris Low contributed to this story."}
{"title": "Man City didn't view Arsenal as a threat, but now they do", "date": "2023-10-05 12:29:45", "text": "Craig Burley says losing Bukayo Saka to injury is an especially big blow for Arsenal ahead of their Premier League fixture against Man City. (2:18)\nWhen Arsenal approached Manchester City over the availability of full-back João Cancelo earlier this summer, the short-shrift response signalled a marked change in attitude from a year earlier.\nCity had then allowed striker Gabriel Jesus and left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko to join the Gunners for fees totalling around £90 million, deals which at the time seemed to reflect both Mikel Arteta's growing reputation as a coach and the amiable nature of his friendship with his former boss at City, Pep Guardiola.\nThe arrivals of Jesus and Zinchenko helped clarify Arteta's vision for the Gunners more than anyone imagined -- the team that finished 24 points behind City in 2021-22 suddenly emerged as their main rivals, ending the season in second place having spent a total of 248 days at the top of the table.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nSo much so, in fact, that as Arsenal tried their luck in negotiations for another player to have fallen out of favour in Cancelo, City's approach had completely altered.\n\"City's view of us is completely different this year than last,\" one senior executive at Arsenal told ESPN.\nCancelo's relationship with Guardiola had deteriorated and a permanent transfer fee in excess of £50m was suggested. The Gunners would not necessarily have been deterred by that valuation, but City had no intention of strengthening Arteta's side once again.\nWith Jesus and Zinchenko, City acquiesced to Arsenal on the basis of receiving healthy transfer fees for two players about the enter the final year of their respective contracts. This time, City ended up agreeing on a simple loan with Barcelona for Cancelo in a move that contained no option or obligation to sign permanently and a modest loan fee. Whatever the financial hit, City's view was that Cancelo should not join Arsenal. They had benefitted enough previously.\nFor the Gunners, the versatile Jurriën Timber represented a much more viable option and they moved to sign him for £38m from Ajax. Arsenal were also interested in City midfielder Ilkay Gündogan but he chose to join Barcelona at the end of his contract, a move he later described as a \"childhood dream\" and one which ensured City avoided any further embarrassment.\nThere was a time when City regularly signed players from Arsenal: five players -- Kolo Toure, Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri -- made the journey north between 2009 and 2014 as City's Abu Dhabi takeover gave them a wealth the Gunners could not compete with.\nThe recent reversal was down, in part, to City simply not viewing Arsenal as a direct threat; the same could arguably be true of Chelsea now given they allowed Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer to join the Blues in the last 16 months.\nCity's stance on Cancelo is symptomatic of the respect Arsenal gained through last season's title challenge. Sources have told ESPN that it didn't take Guardiola long to realise how much the players had helped Arteta's rebuild. It is said Arsenal's 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea in Orlando last July was the moment he first thought the club were on their way to becoming a serious proposition.\nChelsea were in disarray at the time -- and would sack head coach Thomas Tuchel a month or so later -- but the Gunners exhibited a fluidity and determination that would propel them up the table in the subsequent campaign.\nThey fell short of a first Premier League title since 2004, somewhat running out of steam as a combination of fatigue, inexperience and William Saliba's injury undermined performances in the final few weeks. But City knew they were in a proper fight, run close by a team that, while not yet good enough to be considered an equal, is certainly reducing the gap at significant speed.\nSunday's meeting between the two sides offers a measure of that progress and a chance for Arsenal to address another key factor in separating these sides: the head-to-head record.\nDespite the pressure City were under in pursuing a treble, they gave Arsenal something of a schooling in both Premier League matches last season in addition to knocking Arteta's side out of the FA Cup at the third-round stage.\nThe first league meeting was originally pushed back from October to February as a result of fixture complications related to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. City outclassed Arsenal in a 3-1 win at Emirates Stadium and beat them 4-1 in April as Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland ripped the Gunners to shreds.\nAugust's Community Shield victory over City on penalties was hailed by goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale as \"a marker to know we can go and beat Man City in a big game when it matters\" but a Premier League win this weekend can have a truly transformative effect.\nArsenal have lost their last 12 league meetings with City; they have not taken three points off them since January 2015.\nIf City view Arsenal differently, the opposite could also be true. Perhaps, finally, Arsenal believe they are beatable. City unexpectedly lost 2-1 to Wolves last weekend and the suspension of midfielder Rodri -- who played more league minutes than any other City player last season -- after his red card, alongside the absense of injured playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, makes them a less formidable proposition.\nMidfield is an area where Declan Rice will look to take centre stage, having been the subject of offers from both Arsenal and City prior to leaving West Ham for an initial £100m this summer.\nCity felt Arsenal could still be bullied in a physical challenge, particularly in April's game when they went more direct to Haaland to use his power. Rice offers more robustness, but he will also need to exhibit bravery in his passing to help Arsenal impose themselves.\nHad City signed Rice, he would almost certainly have lined up against Arsenal this weekend with Rodri suspended but, as it is, he will seek to reinvigorate Arteta's side as they aim to shake off a Champions League midweek defeat to Lens.\nBukayo Saka's fitness will make a significant difference -- the club are waiting on scan results to determine the extent of a muscular problem -- but whether the 22-year-old forward is available or not, one thing is for sure: City won't underestimate Arsenal any longer."}

(1:41)\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he wants his side's Premier League game against Tottenham Hotspur to be replayed after a Luis Díaz goal was incorrectly ruled out for offside in one of the worst errors in the history of VAR.\nThe score was 0-0 in the 34th minute when the incident happened, and Liverpool went on to lose 2-1 to an injury-time Joël Matip own goal.\n- The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Díaz's offside goal\n- VAR's wildest moments: Diaz offside, Alisson's two red cards\nBut does Klopp have any grounds for the match to be replayed? And is it even possible? We look at what's happened.\nProfessional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the governing body for referees, has admitted \"standards fell short of expectations\" for the Díaz goal.\nThe VAR during the game, Darren England, incorrectly thought the on-field decision was \"goal.\" While he quickly identified that Díaz was onside, he told the referee \"check complete\" -- which mistakenly indicated to the on-field team that the offside flag was correct.\nThe game restarted with the score still 0-0.\nPGMOL subsequently released the full audio of the VAR conversation.\nOn Wednesday, he told a news conference: \"Not as a manager of Liverpool so much, more as a football person, I think the only outcome should be a replay. Probably will not happen. The argument against that will probably be that if we open that gate then everyone will ask for it.\n\"I think the situation is that unprecedented that ... something like that, as far as I can remember, never happened. That's why a replay would be the right thing.\"\nNo yet, as Klopp says the club are still \"going through the information we have.\"\nOn Sunday night, Liverpool issued a strongly worded statement which said the error \"undermined sporting integrity.\"\nYes. As you can imagine, the possibility of having to replay a match, for whatever reason, has to be covered within the Premier League rule book.\nRule L.18. states: \"The Board shall have power to order that a League Match be replayed provided that a recommendation to that effect has been made by a Commission in exercise of its powers under Rule W.51.\"\nBut that doesn't automatically mean the rule applies in a case like this.\nLiverpool would have to lodge a complaint with the Premier League. A commission would then be set up (as per Rule W.51) to assess the merits of the case and reach a decision.\nWithin the remit of the commission is to \"recommend that the Board orders that a League Match or such other match ... be replayed.\"\nNot in English league football. Cup games have been replayed due to a number of factors, including a team making too many substitutes or fielding an ineligible player.\nFamously in 1999, an FA Cup game between Arsenal and Sheffield United was replayed after the Gunners scored from a throw-in after the opposition had knocked the ball out for an Arsenal player to receive treatment. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger later made the offer to replay the match.\nThat might help things along, but the Premier League would still need to agree amid the danger of a precedent being set.\nThis is where it starts to fall down.\nVAR protocol, which is part of the Laws of the Game, states: \"In principle, a match is not invalidated because of: wrong decision(s) involving the VAR (as the VAR is a match official).\"\nThis is where we need to revisit Liverpool's statement, where they very specifically said: \"It is clear that the correct application of the laws of the game did not occur.\"\nWhile a wrong decision might not be grounds for a game to be played again, failing to apply the Laws of the Game correctly can be seen as a valid reason.\nHowever, this is usually a more technical reason, such as a team being allowed to score a goal through an incorrect application of encroachment on a missed penalty.\nJulien Laurens thinks Luis Díaz's disallowed goal in Tottenham vs. Liverpool is the biggest VAR mistake in the Premier League so far this season.\nIt is likely they will say the \"wrong\" decision was not made by the match officials. The VAR knew Diaz was onside, and was supposed to be telling the referee the forward was onside. Therefore, this is a mistake in applying the decision rather than simply getting it wrong.\nThe closest is probably the goal France had disallowed against Tunisia at the World Cup last year.\nAntoine Griezmann thought he had equalised deep into stoppage time, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. However, the referee had restarted the game, and then blown for full-time before the review happened -- which broke VAR protocol. It should not have been possible to disallow the goal.\nFrance protested and wanted the goal to be reinstated, but the appeal was dismissed by FIFA's disciplinary committee and the result stood.\nWhy didn't Arsenal get a replay when the VAR failed to disallow Brentford's goal for offside last season? The VAR didn't notice there was a player offside, so it was an error.\nWhat about the goal Sheffield United were not awarded in the 0-0 draw with Aston Villa when goal-line technology failed? The VAR didn't check for a tech failure, so they didn't know it happened.\nAnd how about Brighton's disallowed goal at Crystal Palace when the VAR drew the lines on the wrong player? The VAR decision was offside and communicated as offside.\nFor Liverpool, the VAR decision was onside and communicated as offside, and that's the difference they will point to.\nIt's highly unlikely. Even though it was a unique circumstance, it would set a dangerous precedent.\nIf they did, could Wolves then ask to replay their game at Manchester United after they were wrongly denied an injury-time penalty through a bad VAR decision?\nIf Liverpool do make an official request it is unlikely to go down well with other clubs, who have all suffered their own injustices, none more so than Brighton who were subjected to a catalogue of errors last season which may have impacted their chances of making the Champions League this season."}

(1:38)\nThe 2023-24 Champions League group stage is underway, and matchday two is in the books with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Barcelona the only teams to maintain a 100% record. After a thrilling round of games, we asked our writers Gab Marcotti, Rob Dawson and Sam Marsden to answer some of our burning questions.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n- Guardiola passes Sir Alex Ferguson for UCL wins\nManchester United. Two games, two defeats, and they're already struggling to qualify for the Round of 16. They've scored five goals in games against Bayern Munich and Galatasaray but the way they've defended has been appalling, leaking seven goals in 180 minutes of football. They conceded three at home against Galatasaray but it could have been even worse. Mauro Icardi missed a penalty after Casemiro had been sent off, and also had a good chance in stoppage-time with the score already at 3-2. It's not the first time in recent history that United have been in trouble in the group stage, going out before the knockouts in both 2015-16 and 2020-21. -- Dawson\nFive teams are on zero points, but obviously Manchester United stand out, mainly because of the recurring psychodrama in the background (Antony, the Glazers, Jadon Sancho, half the starting back four out, etc.) and their horrible league form as well. I'd throw in Paris Saint-Germain as well, simply because of the manner of the 4-1 defeat at Newcastle United, the way the club can be a zoo, and the fact that head coach Luis Enrique is, well, different. And if I'm Arsenal, I'm not taking things for granted either. Sevilla home and away next can be very tricky. -- Marcotti\nIt's Man United, isn't it?! But to add some variety, there is also pressure on Luis Enrique and PSG. It's not just that they lost to Newcastle, it's that they were beaten 4-1. Throw in the fact they are in the toughest group in the competition and now have a double-header coming up against AC Milan and it's not hard to imagine them failing to make it into the knockout rounds. Three draws and a defeat in seven Ligue 1 games show this is not just a European issue, either. The post-Lionel Messi and Neymar years, built around Kylian Mbappé and French brilliance, were not supposed to be so rocky so soon. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley and Alejandro Moreno assess another dismal defeat for Man United in the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Galatasaray.\nFC Copenhagen. They've never been past the group stage, but they've done enough in the opening two games to show they've got a chance this time. They were 2-0 up against Galatasaray in Istanbul with four minutes to go, and were only pegged back to 2-2 after going down to 10 men; then they took the lead at home against Bayern before narrowly losing 2-1. Their fate in Group A will be decided by back-to-back games against Manchester United, and with Erik ten Hag's team not playing well, the Danish champions could spring a surprise. -- Dawson\nLet's face it, nobody in Group F (Newcastle, PSG, AC Milan and Dortmund), which is wide open, is an underdog. Nor are Lens, frankly. So I'm going to suggest Feyenoord. I love the fact that head coach Arne Slot decided to stick around and give it a go after winning the Eredivisie title, rather than chasing coin elsewhere like so many of his colleagues would have done. They gave Atletico Madrid a real fright away, and can do the same to others. -- Marcotti\nMaybe underdog is pushing it, but Real Sociedad were in pot four in the draw so should technically be the worst the team in their group. I know the science to the pots means that isn't necessarily the case but Internazionale and Benfica would still have been the two teams expected to progress. Instead, La Real sit top after two games thanks to a draw against the Italians and Tuesday's 2-0 win at FC Salzburg. Take Kubo and Brais Méndez are great fun to watch, and they have a homegrown spine that makes it easy to root for them. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley lays into the performance of PSG's Kylian Mbappe following their thumping 4-1 defeat to Newcastle United in the Champions League.\nManchester United have been rubbish in the Champions League but £72 million striker Rasmus Hojlund has, at least, been a positive. The 20-year-old became the youngest player to score in his first two Champions League games since Erling Haaland when he found the net against Galatasaray after opening his United account on matchday one against Bayern. His first against Galatasaray was a thumping header from Marcus Rashford's cross, and his second was about his pace and finishing ability after racing away from the halfway line. Hojlund is under immense pressure to perform as United's central striker and, so far, he's handling it well. -- Dawson\nAm I allowed to say Newcastle defender Dan Burn? What, you want somebody more glamorous? I had zero expectations for Icardi, but he came up huge for Galatasaray last season and it's continuing this year. Some love for Atletico striker Álvaro Morata too, please. Mendez has been really impressive for Real Sociedad, and Man City's Julián Álvarez gets better every time I see him play. -- Marcotti\nIt's hard to focus on one player after just two games, but I'll go with Alvarez. He was the star in Manchester City's win over Red Star Belgrade and then came off the bench to down RB Leipzig on Wednesday. He's making it impossible for City boss Pep Guardiola to leave him out when the big games come around. A shout out for João Félix, too, who has been good in both of Barcelona's games so far, and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham. Even if we expected him to be good, we did not imagine him having this impact so soon, with important goals in wins over Union Berlin and Napoli. -- Marsden\nAle Moreno heaps praise on Jude Bellingham following Real Madrid's Champions League win over Napoli.\nThey need to defend better. Injuries, particularly at the back, have been a problem this season, but Lisandro Martínez, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are likely to miss the rest of the group-stage games and manager Ten Hag has to find a way of improving with the players he's got available. One easy fix is to move Sofyan Amrabat from a makeshift left-back into midfield to give Casemiro some help. Casemiro will have to serve a suspension after his red card against Galatasaray, but having him alongside Amrabat once the Brazilian is back will make United far more robust in the middle of the pitch. -- Dawson\nIt's kinda two different questions as I see it, in the sense they don't need to hit their stride to get out of the group. Obviously, they need to take four of six points in the double-header against Copenhagen and avoid defeat in Istanbul. Then, on matchday six, they play Bayern, who will probably have qualified by then and may play the C-team. So that's eight points they can get without being particularly good. And that might be enough.\nHow do they actually get good? Well, that's a far more complicated question. I'm not sure their injured guys will be back in time to affect this group stage, Casemiro is now suspended, Antony is anyone's guess. There's enough there that Bruno Fernandes and Rashford can carry them at times (not all the time as we've seen) but there's a reason why they've only won three games all season (I'm not counting the win over Palace in the Carabao Cup). And, lest we forget, Wolverhampton Wanderers were robbed after outplaying them for long stretches, and United they had to come from two goals down to beat Nottingham Forest, who played the last 23 minutes with 10 men. Meanwhile, against Burnley, they were thoroughly outplayed and it took a moment of magic from Bruno (and ... wait for it ... Jonny Freaking Evans!) to get the three points. Yeah, it's bad, it's really bad. -- Marcotti\nAs Gab points out, the two are not mutually exclusive. United are now in a situation where they need to turn to an old football cliche and take things game by game. In that sense, they have a nice fixture list. Back-to-back matches against Copenhagen, who have proven tough opponents against Galatasaray and Bayern, give them a chance to revive their European hopes. Winning those fixtures would set up a huge game in Turkey against Galatasaray. Beyond that, they need to get players back in their natural positions (which is not easy with their list of absentees, but Amrabat into midfield would be a start) and build around their best players, who at the moment are Bruno and Hojlund. The latter's goal-scoring ability could help lift the mood around the team, but it looks bleak at the moment. -- Marsden"}
{"title": "Best, worst moments of Xavi's 100 games as Barcelona manager", "date": "2023-10-05 12:38:50", "text": "There have been ups and downs along the way, but it's indisputable that Barcelona are in a better place now than they were when they appointed Xavi Hernandez, as the coach took charge of his 100th game on Wednesday night against Porto in the Champions League.\nXavi, 43, replaced Ronald Koeman in November 2021 just months after Lionel Messi had left Barça, with the club in financial crisis, ninth in LaLiga and on the verge of elimination from the Champions League. Almost two years on, the Catalan side are reigning LaLiga champions, outplayed bitter rivals Real Madrid to win the Spanish Super Cup earlier this year and have hopes of regaining their status among Europe's biggest sides.\nThe path back to the summit has not always been straightforward, especially in the Champions League. Barça have been knocked out in the group stage in back-to-back campaigns and after dropping into the Europa League as a consequence, have also failed to make it past the quarterfinal stage of the continent's secondary competition.\nOverall, though, the highs outweigh the lows. There have been two trophies -- including a first LaLiga title since 2019 -- 63 victories from 100 games and a squad overhaul that's seen the focus switch back to La Masia, the club's famous academy. Gavi (19), Lamine Yamal (16), Alejandro Balde (19), Pedri (20) and Fermín López (20) are five players aged 20 or under getting regular minutes under Xavi, who has also added premium, top-flight experience in the form of Robert Lewandowski and Ilkay Gündogan.\nIncredibly, just three players remain from the starting XI in Xavi's first game, a 1-0 win over Espanyol on Nov. 20, 2021: goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen, plus midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Gavi. Meanwhile Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba are among the heavyweights who have left as Xavi managed to separate his friendships with his former teammates from the storied club's sporting issues.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nThe 21-man squad for the current season -- the 19 players registered for the first team plus youngsters Lamine and Fermín -- features 11 Xavi signings, plus various players who were in the B team or youth teams at the time when he took over. It's a combination which Xavi, who recently signed a new contract until 2025, feels is fuelling Barça's push for trophies.\n\"What I would highlight is the mix we have achieved between veterans and youngsters and the human quality of the players in the squad,\" he told ESPN as he looked ahead to his 100th game in charge. \"It is not easy to create the atmosphere we have in the dressing room at the moment.\"\n(With reporting by Jordi Blanco)\nThe games Xavi remembers most fondly are the ones that yielded trophies. The first came via a 3-1 win over Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup final in January this year.\n\"That was the best game, absolutely no doubt,\" Xavi said. \"I have said it several times and I stand by it. I go for that game because of the performance, because you saw how we wanted to play and because it was our first trophy. Also, because of who it was against. After that day, the players believed in everything we wanted to do.\"\nThe LaLiga title followed a few months later. After Franck Kessié's dramatic late winner in the Clásico against Madrid, Barça sealed top spot with a 4-2 win away against Espanyol, prompting angry home supporters to chase the Blaugrana players off the pitch as they celebrated a first domestic championship in four years.\n\"Winning the league will always be unforgettable,\" Xavi added. \"We finally did it. It had been our main objective since we took on the job. We showed that we could do it -- and against our city rival as well. We produced one of our best performances of the season.\"\nSam Marsden explains why Joao Felix has made an instant impact at Barca, after struggling at Atletico Madrid and Chelsea.\nWhile there were no trophies in 2021-22, there were memorable moments as Barça climbed the table to secure Champions League qualification -- something that was far from guaranteed when Xavi took the job. The midseason signings of Ferran Torres, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Dani Alves and Adama Traoré sparked a revival and produced some scintillating performances between January and March. The 4-2 wins against Atletico Madrid and Napoli stand out, while that run of form going into the international break culminated with a 4-0 over Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in LaLiga.\nThat win prompted Pique to post on social media: \"We're back.\" Pique's comment proved premature as Barça suffered a dip in form after the international break, but those results laid the foundations for a title charge the following campaign -- albeit after a summer in which Lewandowski, Raphinha, Jules Koundé, Andreas Christensen and Kessié arrived after club assets were sold off to fund a splurge on the transfer market.\nThe Super Cup win over Madrid, in which Xavi fielded four midfielders plus Lewandowski and Ousmane Dembélé in attack, provided the squad with the self-belief to go on and win LaLiga, but it was two performances this season that Xavi described as \"the best Barça have played\" during his tenure.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

The way Barça played, with Cancelo stepping into midfield, Felix linking with Lewandowski and quick, one-touch positional play across the pitch \"is the path to follow,\" Xavi said.\nDespite success domestically and impressive wins over 14-time European champions Madrid, Barça have still struggled in Europe. Capitulations in recent years against Roma, Liverpool and Bayern Munich have left their mark, and it is in the Champions League where Xavi's side have suffered their bleakest nights.\nA goalless draw at Camp Nou against Benfica in Xavi's first Champions League game in charge left them with a mountain to climb going to Munich in 2021. Needing a win to get through to the knockout rounds, they capitulated, losing 3-0. Xavi labelled that defeat \"rock bottom\" but it was elimination a year later, when he had been given time to put his mark on the side, that stung more.\n\"The 3-0 loss at home to Bayern last season,\" Xavi told ESPN when asked for the worst game of the 99 he has overseen. \"It was a tough defeat, the worst because it was the night we were knocked out. We either weren't able to or didn't know how to compete in the necessary way.\n\"Bayern have been my toughest opponent. It's always difficult to play against them. And, of course, Madrid. They are always a hard side to face whatever the circumstances because of who they are and because of everything that surrounds a Clásico.\"\nThat Bayern defeat had already been preceded by some disappointing European nights: a 2-0 loss in Munich, a 1-0 defeat to Inter Milan and a 3-3 draw at home to the Italians, which was actually the result which effectively ended Barça's Champions League campaign that season. A Europa League exit followed at the hands of Manchester United, although elimination in the same competition to Eintracht Frankfurt -- when the German team's supporters took over Camp Nou, snapping up over 20,000 tickets in the home end and prompting an internal club investigation -- was arguably more painful.\n\"The problem was we were considered favourites going into it,\" Xavi said of Barça's Europa League struggles. \"I don't think we fully believed that we were playing in that competition. It is hard to compete in a tournament that a lot of Barca fans and people, in general, don't care much about.\"\nThe 4-0 Copa del Rey semifinal reverse to Madrid in April at Camp Nou, after winning the first leg 1-0, was minimised due to the number of players missing for the game and the fact that the LaLiga title was imminent, but it was a result that sewed just a few doubts about whether Barça really were back.\nThere is no letup at Barça and winning one title does not buy you another 100 games in charge. Xavi, who made 767 appearances for the club -- a number only bettered by Lionel Messi -- knows that.\n\"For those that know the club, it's about excellence in everything we do,\" he said in a news conference earlier this year. \"That's why this is the most difficult club in the world. There is no comparison. There is no other club in the world like this, [with that] demand to win playing well. It is very difficult.\n\"We are obliged to win and play well. This is Barça. A 1-0 in the 90th minute is not enough, we know this.\"\nThat lays out what is expected from Xavi over the next two years. Barça must continue to improve aesthetically. They have to be in the running to win LaLiga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup. It is in Europe, though, where Xavi faces his biggest challenge. There will be no excuses if they fail to get out of a Champions League group this season that includes Porto, Royal Antwerp and Shakhtar Donetsk.\nFrom there, there is an element of luck of the draw, but Barça need to show they can at least compete with -- not necessarily beat -- Europe's biggest teams again, as they seek a first Champions League trophy since 2015, back when Xavi was still part of the team's midfield. They are on the path to doing that and are in an infinitely better place than they were when they appointed Xavi, whose only previously managerial experience was in Qatar with Al Sadd, but there are challenges ahead.\nDespite victories over Madrid and winning LaLiga, there is still the nagging feeling that big European performances are needed. And if Barça make it to those games, there are questions for Xavi: Will playing Cancelo and Balde as full-backs leave you too exposed in more open games? Which is his best centre-back pairing? Does he pick Oriol Romeu at the base of the midfield, or simply arrange his best midfielders? A box midfield four or a front three? Who starts on the right wing? Can he get the best out of an ageing Lewandowski?\nThe answers to those questions, and others, will shape his next 100 matches."}

It wasn't until last year -- when I returned to campus for the second time as an ESPN employee -- that I realized how much I loved (and missed) a proper fall. I gasped at the foliage. I stared wide-eyed at the bushels (like, actual bushels!) of gourds lining the streets. I was taken back to my childhood and willingly wrapped myself in all of the pumpkin spice nostalgia.\nMy colleagues seemed charmed (if not a little startled) by my exuberance. Numerous co-workers leaned into it, generously taking me for scenic drives through some of the area's most breathtaking vistas. (One of whom is likely proofreading this article right now. Hi, Pierre. [Good morning, Liz and gremlins.] That detour past the old-timey cemetery was so stinking cool!) It never got old -- for me, at least. And I hope my genuine wonder rubbed off on them, serving as a potential reminder to take in the less-than-sophisticated (dare I say, \"basic\") joys of the season.\nI've been trying to manufacture that same cozy feeling in preparation for this weekend's trip. Numerous outings to the local Trader Joe's have resulted in an abundance of harvest-themed purchases. And while the bouquet of sunflowers on my desk looks beautiful and the pumpkin yogurt tasted surprisingly good... I want the real thing.\nI want to hear fall leaves crunch under a pair of cute boots. I want to sip apple cider and not sweat. And I really want the Bears to not embarrass themselves Thursday night. None of those things will happen, however, without taking action. I need to -- on my own -- venture outside of the Bristol bubble and discover all of the bucolic hiking trails and quaint roadside stands. And the Bears, well, they need to do a whole lot but should probably start with letting Justin Fields use his legs.\nThe same is true in fantasy. We're a month into the 2023 experiment and, speaking for myself, it has felt more like raking the lawn than snacking on pumpkin seeds. We have reached a point of transition. More than a few hot summer takes have begun to chill.\nThe emergence of new patterns and facts requires us to confront our feelings about what we thought was going to happen and instead get real about what is actually going on. Whether that means benching Joe Burrow (QB31) or getting behind Evan Engram (TE4); it's time to shed what isn't working and adventure toward something different. There's no guaranteeing these adjustments will lead to victorious gains, but neither will nervously standing still.\nSo, while that maple chai-scented room diffuser might smell great now, you're going to need something stronger to get you through the winter.\nAnthony Richardson, QB, Indianapolis Colts: Richardson is showing zero anxiety. This man is fearlessly running -- literally and figuratively -- toward his destiny. Even while in the grasp of Aaron Freaking Donald, Richardson is advancing the ball. His maturation as a passer might still be in its beginning stages, but the rookie has, thus far, recorded the fifth-highest pressured completion percentage (63.6%). That shows guts and intelligence. Richardson's physical tools are successfully translating to the NFL while manifesting a boon for fantasy investors.\nCongrats to all of those who believed from the jump because Richardson is currently the QB2 in fantasy points per game. That's what happens when a wildly gifted mobile passer is not only allowed but even encouraged to lean into his talent as a rusher. Richardson has executed 14 designed runs in three games, which includes all four of his touchdowns. (Can someone please forward this to Luke Getsy?) As a result, he has managed more fantasy points per game as a runner (12.38) than Joe Mixon, Rachaad White or Alexander Mattison. Additionally, his 29.60 fantasy points from Week 4 was the third-highest total by any QB this season (and 11 completions, tied for the fewest by any signal-caller in a full game so far this year).\nRichardson will have to shift some of his focus from the ground to the air versus the Titans on Sunday. Tennessee has allowed a completion percentage of nearly 71% and an average exceeding 241 passing yards (10th-most) per week to opposing quarterbacks. Mike Vrabel's gritty defensive front also managed to hold Deshaun Watson (the only dual-threat QB the team has faced, save a compromised Joe Burrow) to 16 rushing yards. It figures to be a close battle (+/- 1) but my money is on Richardson's continued ascent. He's a top-five fantasy play in Week 5.\nDe'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins: While we're on the topic of stocks rising ... holy heck, welcome to the NFL, De'Von Achane! The third-round selection out of Texas A&M followed up his 233-yard and four-TD effort in Week 3 by blazing his way to another 120 yards and two scores in Week 4. So, is this a fluke? Or is Achane the real deal?\nI'm leaning toward the latter. How does that genie fit back in the bottle? Achane's snap percentage has increased with each effort (0% - 8% - 42% - 66%). Meanwhile, Raheem Mostert's playing time has decreased since sharing the backfield with the explosive rookie (74% - 51% - 41%). The Dolphins -- like the rest of the modern NFL -- figure to go RBBC. However, Achane is proving to be the more effective rusher. His 11.4 yards per carry is as absurd as it is unsustainable. However, his 2.8 yards after contact per rush also ranks among the top three at the position.\nYou can't sit this guy. Not now. And certainly not as an 11-point favorite versus a reeling Giants squad that gave up 5.3 YPC to Seattle on Monday night. Achane has youth, juice and upside. He also has managed double-digit touches in back-to-back efforts. Consider the burgeoning star a top-12 fantasy RB this Sunday.\nMiles Sanders, RB, Carolina Panthers: If Miami's backfield is Fast & Furious, then Carolina's is giving Radiator Springs vibes. Sanders entered Week 4 with a groin injury, and although his effort deserves snaps, his output was worrisome. The Philly transplant managed a meager 19 rushing yards on 13 carries. While the aforementioned ailment certainly contributed to the vet's inefficiency, his rushing numbers have steadily decreased since the season opener. Sanders recorded 72 rushing yards in Week 1, but then a total of just 86 over his next three contests. Additionally, his 2.9 yards per carry ranks 37th among 44 qualifiers.\nIf there is a silver lining, it's Sanders' work in the passing game. Bryce Young is checking down on the regular. As a result, Sanders ranks third in team targets (23) and receptions (15), placing him among the top five at the position in both of those categories. But this offense has no juice. Between an unfavorable game script and Chuba Hubbard's pesky presence, Sanders is shaping up to be TD-dependent with little to no upside. He figures to further languish on the RB2/RB3 bubble when he takes on an improved (and rested) Lions defense in Week 5.\nMichael Wilson, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Meaningful impacts are hard to come by at the next level. Lord knows I'm still trying to make a positive one on my mother-in-law. Wilson, however, has delighted thus far in his pro campaign.\nThe Stanford alum has demonstrated enticing chemistry with Josh Dobbs, recording 50-plus receiving yards in three consecutive efforts. That stat becomes more impressive when noting that he's just one of 10 wideouts to accomplish such a feat. Wilson has additionally managed a top-15 aDOT (13.5 yards) along with the highest catch rate (88%) in the league. Furthermore, the rookie has outsnapped Rondale Moore in back-to-back games and managed to out-target the vet in his 7-76-0 effort at San Francisco this past Sunday. That arrow is pointing up, friends.\nA player with plus size and strength, Wilson is on his way to emerging as the ideal complement to Marquise Brown. It might not happen this week. And he'll still be saddled by Dobbs. Although with injuries mounting and byes upon us, now is the time to stash a rising star like Wilson. He's worth a speculative flex versus a Bengals defense that has allowed the ninth-most opponent yards per game (364.3).\nJordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings: High expectations often lead to disappointment. So does putting up a bagel on any given Sunday. Enter Addison. The 2021 Biletnikoff Award winner was the first rookie off of most fantasy draft boards. Touchdowns over his first two starts appeared to validate the preseason hype. But all that good juju came to a screeching halt when the 21-year-old failed to convert on his lone target in Week 4. Was it the result of uncharacteristic quarterback play and game flow? Probably. We still need to address the facts and recalibrate our feelings, though.\nAddison's 13.4% target share ranks third on his team (just ahead of Mattison's 12.1%) and 70th among wide receivers. His above average aDOT (12.9) and his efficiency in the red area have buoyed his fantasy numbers. That kind of usage screams boom/bust. The reality of Addison's situation has been tempered by the Vikings' pass-heavy game scripts. When Kirk Cousins puts the ball in the air 40-plus times, Addison is likely to draw at least five looks. Makes easy sense, right? That is not, however, something we can rely on.\nConsider Week 4 the wake-up call. That doesn't mean Addison is a cut candidate. Definitely not while we're weaving through bye weeks and subbing players in and out of IR spots. It does, however, mean thinking about Addison (at least for the moment) as more of an upside flex than an automatic WR3. He's a top-40 FF WR option in what's projected to be a high-scoring game (53.0) versus the Chiefs.\nDalton Schultz, TE, Houston Texans: Schultz has been quiet because his young QB hasn't needed a binky. C.J. Stroud doesn't mind letting it rip, averaging 8.0 yards per attempt (QB3) while registering the sixth-most air yards (953) on the season. From 20 yards out, however, the former Cowboy is proving to be his young QB's bestie.\nSchultz is tied for first in team red zone looks (31% RZ target share) and leads the Texans' offense in end zone opportunities (38% EZ target share). From a positional point of view, His four red zone targets -- as well as this three end zone looks -- is tied for fourth among tight ends.\nIs this chasing touchdowns? Absolutely. Do I like to do it? No, it feels dirty. But some of us -- I'm looking at you, Kyle Pitts and Darren Waller investors -- need to light a three-wicked Yankee candle and conjure up some fantasy goodness. The manifesting figures to continue at Atlanta, as the Falcons have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. I'm optimistically forecasting four grabs, 41 yards and a tuddy for Schultz.\nTyler Conklin, TE, New York Jets: As Travis Kelce has consistently reminded us, knowing not just how but when to shoot your shot is key. Conklin has been on my radar since Zach Wilson took over as the Jets' starter. It wasn't until the CMU product finished second in team targets versus the Chiefs, however, that I considered leaning into his streaming potential.\nConklin delivered a smattering of top-12 fantasy finishes over 2022, although most of his highs came without Wilson at the helm. Whatever was lacking between the two last year appears to have dissolved this go-round. Conklin ranks third on the team in offensive play percentage (76.2%) and second in team targets (17). He has managed 5-plus looks in each game over the past three weeks. Although those numbers are far from astonishing, only eight tight ends have managed the same or better. Welcome (again) to the TE hellscape.\nAvailable in over 90% of ESPN fantasy leagues, Conklin offers sneaky sleeper appeal in Week 5. He'll face a bruised and battered Broncos defense that has coaxed production out even the most broken offenses. Denver has given up the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, including a stunning 7-85-2 stat line to Cole Kmet in Week 4.\nI can't promise it will be pretty. But I know it's something different. Consider Conklin this week's newest borderline TE1.\nFollow Liz on social @LizLoza_FF"}

(0:41)\nASHBURN, Va. -- Sam Howell needed to make a choice.\nIt was a day before North Carolina's 2019 spring game, and the true freshman quarterback was playing rock, paper, scissors to determine which candidate for the starting quarterback job would get first chance at impressing the coaches.\nHowell won (he chose scissors), and it was the only opportunity he needed.\nHowell was competing with two redshirt freshmen for the job: Cade Fortin and Jace Ruder. Howell's talent was obvious. But coach Mack Brown didn't know how he'd handle the pressure.\n• The rise of Commanders QB Sam Howell\n• Claypool adds to Bears' legacy of issues\n• Rookie QB Richardson's poise key for Colts\n• Bills offense chasing history\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\nBut when Howell took the field, he delivered on one of his first throws.\n\"He turned it loose and zipped it. It was a perfect strike. We all said, 'Wow,'\" Brown said. \"That was one of the first times we knew he wasn't going to panic in front of people.\"\nThere were hiccups: Howell tossed three picks early in those spring practices. He didn't throw another one.\n\"I was worried about him losing his confidence,\" Brown said. \"He didn't even blink. Very mature for his age and experience. He does not get rattled.\"\nThose traits helped enable Howell to go from becoming North Carolina's first true freshman starting quarterback to being named the ACC's rookie of the year. His 38 touchdown passes set an FBS record for a freshman. He helped elevate the Tar Heels almost immediately before leaving after three years as the school's record holder in 27 different categories, including passing yards (10,283), passing touchdowns (92) and career passing efficiency (164.2).\nLooking back to that first season at North Carolina, it's clear why there's a belief Howell can succeed in the NFL. From his preparation to his demeanor, Howell displayed key traits that helped him go from a prized recruit, to early enrollee, to program-changer.\nIt's what Washington hopes he'll become for a franchise that hasn't had the same quarterback as full-time starter for more than three seasons since 1993, and hasn't had a first-team All-Pro quarterback since Joe Theismann in 1983.\n\"He's special,\" said Brown, whose first season at UNC coincided with Howell's, \"and he's the reason we're sitting here where we are. [North Carolina] won five games in the two years before us, then went to four straight bowls. If you ask me the No. 1 reason, it would be Sam Howell.\"\n.\nHOWELL SAT AT his locker on Sept. 27, casually chatting with a media member. Moments later, he was having a conversation with backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, whose locker was next to his. Next, someone from the equipment room wandered over for a brief exchange. It would have been difficult for an outsider to have known just three days earlier, Howell had thrown four interceptions in a 37-3 loss to the Buffalo Bills -- his worst performance as a pro.\n\"I put that game behind me and worry about the next game,\" Howell said of his philosophy. \"I go back to my process, doing what's always worked for me and never losing that confidence.\n\"Ever since the game ended Sunday, I was excited for the next game just because I'm ready for another opportunity, I'm ready to go out there and play like myself again.\"\nThe next game: He threw for 290 yards and one touchdown in an overtime loss to the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles.\nThat demeanor was shaped long ago. Howell has always been low-key about his success and didn't panic over his miscues.\n\"As far as getting emotional, that's never been him,\" said his father, Duke, who was his offensive coordinator at Sun Valley High School in the Charlotte area. \"When he was in high school, he would throw a pick and I was up in the booth and I'd get on the headset and all I could do was hear him breathe. He never said a word. I'd ask what happened and he'd say such and such. I'd go back and watch the film and, yeah, that did happen.\"\nIt's part of why Howell is comfortable in tense situations. In the last two minutes of the half and regulation this season, he has thrown for a league-high 375 yards with three touchdowns to one interception. Washington has scored 34 points in those situations, including a tying touchdown on the final play of regulation Sunday. The 23-year-old Howell said in the huddle his job is to, \"Just try to calm the storm.\"\nIt's what he did as a collegiate freshman as well. Howell created a buzz for himself and the Tar Heels program in the season opener -- a 24-20 comeback win over South Carolina.\n\"They were so much more talented,\" former Tar Heels offensive coordinator Phil Longo said of the Gamecocks.\nThe Tar Heels trailed by 11 entering the fourth quarter, but Howell completed 5 of 6 passes for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns in the final 15 minutes. He led two 90-yard drives. In his first collegiate game, Howell threw for 245 yards and two scores.\n\"When we were down, he'd say, 'Coach I got this,'\" Brown said. \"He never blinked.\"\n\"I never saw his face change,\" said Dyami Brown, a former Tar Heels receiver and current Commanders teammate. \"His demeanor was always the same. That helped us out because when you don't see a quarterback panicking or freaking out, you feel comfortable. He always kept his composure.\"\nTHE TRAITS HOWELL earned praise for later were evident in high school. Howell's father said he would watch his games on Hudl, a website that posts game video.\n\"He would stay on Hudl and he would always just study it,\" Duke said.\nDuke said he and the quarterbacks coach were once watching film and trying to decipher another team's coverage. Howell, then a sophomore, walked past, glanced at the screen, relayed the coverage and left.\n\"We were like, 'Yep, that's what they're running,'\" Duke said. \"He had a knack for it, but a lot of that is from a lot of work.\"\nIt didn't end when he got to college; it intensified.\n\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\n\"He was always in the building,\" Mack Brown said. \"He has no hobbies. He's a football junkie, a gym rat. Before he had his current girlfriend, it was Valentine's Day and I said, 'You got a date? Doing anything? He said, 'Yeah, I've got a date with Madden.' We used to laugh and say he's been in the building more than I have.\"\nDuke witnessed his son's football evolution in the spring of 2020, when he lived at home during the pandemic. He'd catch Howell on videoconferences with his Tar Heels coaches.\n\"Just the things he knew, that he had learned in one year, they put a lot on him,\" Duke said. \"He was talking about defensive fronts, knowing the fronts to check to a good play. Most quarterbacks are studying coverages. He was more IDing the front, making calls, what the protections are, checking the protections. Stuff like that; he was light years ahead from the year before.\"\nBecause Howell enrolled in January -- cutting short his senior year of high school -- he needed to catch up fast. Howell did not have a veteran quarterback to learn from. His two competitors were both redshirt freshmen. But, at a time when he should have been prepping for his final high school baseball season, he was displaying his promise in UNC's spring practices.\n\"We went to town on learning the offense,\" said Longo, now at Wisconsin. \"We set up a schedule to meet and he didn't miss a minute. He pounded the film and he'd come in every day and have a list of questions and have an agenda. He's just incredible from a want-to standpoint. His talent was ahead in the spring. Everything else was by the summer.\"\nPersonal quarterback coach Anthony Boone said that rapid growth is not surprising. He has experienced it while working with Howell as well.\n\"It's not something you had to tell him; he just did it,\" Boone said. \"He read online, 'This is what quarterbacks do,' and he took it to heart.\"\nHOWELL WAS RECRUITED by almost every big-time program, including Alabama, Ohio State and Clemson. Howell settled on Florida State but flipped to North Carolina after it hired Longo, previously at Ole Miss, as offensive coordinator.\nAt one point, Howell was going to also play baseball in college, a plan he abandoned after finding football success his freshman year.\nHowell is a natural athlete. As a high school junior, he was a pitcher whose fastball was clocked at 93 mph. Howell's ERA was 0.60, and pro scouts were interested.\nHe also played safety and linebacker in high school. One college coach told his dad he would have recruited him as a linebacker, had he not been a quarterback.\nAfter his sophomore year in college, Duke Howell bought Sam a set of golf clubs. Sam golfs only between February and June, not wanting it to interfere with the football season. Two years later, he accompanied his dad on a golf trip and shot an 82.\n\"Never had a lesson, but he's so competitive,\" Duke said. \"The average guy can't stay focused. [Sam] competes on every shot. Every shot. It's because he's mentally tough; it doesn't matter what sport.\n\"He's a highly focused individual. The biggest trait he has, obviously he's competitive, but his toughness is what he drives off of. Not just physically tough, but mentally tough.\"\nALL THE ELEMENTS that made Howell a success in the past have led the Commanders to believe he'll do the same in the NFL.\nBefore the 2022 draft, one member of the organization said they would have targeted Howell in the second or third round had they not already traded for Carson Wentz that offseason. Duke said the family was told pre-draft to expect Sam to be selected anywhere between the 20th and 40th picks.\nThen he lasted until the fifth round.\n\"There was never a doubt in my mind that Sam [could] produce or play at this level,\" Commanders offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. \"I was shocked that he went as late as he did.\"\nIn January, Rivera named Howell the starter going into offseason workouts. He never relinquished the position and, after the second preseason game, Rivera named him the starter for the season opener.\n\"He's now more than a serviceable quarterback,\" Rivera said. \"He's a guy that's growing. He's a guy that can win. ... I'm excited for it, excited for the team.\"\nHowell is showing that growth, whether by becoming more involved in film sessions -- communicating with receivers what he wants on certain routes -- or by understanding how to handle a situation better.\nIf Howell continues on an upward path, then Washington has a starting quarterback on an inexpensive contract through the 2025 season, allowing it to invest at other positions.\nOn Monday, Rivera said he expected Howell to have a strong performance against Philadelphia after struggling versus Buffalo. Howell had a career-best 76.4 quarterback rating -- a week after enduring his worst (18.4).\n\"He's a very resilient, very tough-minded young man. He bounces back very well at a lot of things,\" Rivera said. \"With him, you're going to have some really good positive plus moments, there's going to be some tough moments. He'll get better and better. I've always been confident in him and just been very optimistic about his potential.\""}
{"title": "'Where receivers go to die': 15 years later, does the quote about Chicago still ring true?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:19:41", "text": "Pat McAfee and his crew share their concerns about the Chicago Bears and QB Justin Fields. (2:48)\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Weeks ahead of the 2023 season, Chicago Bears receiver Darnell Mooney decided to rewatch one of the toughest moments of his career. It was Oct. 5, 2022, when the Bears hosted the Washington Commanders, and both offenses struggled. But with 30 seconds remaining and the Commanders leading 12-7, the Bears had a chance at a game-winning touchdown with a fourth-and-goal on the Washington 4.\nBears quarterback Justin Fields faked a toss and lofted a pass to Mooney, who jumped and nearly caught the ball while he was above the goal line for the touchdown, but he bobbled it and didn't secure the ball until he was driven out of the end zone by inches.\nWashington ball -- and game. Mooney said he was being \"accountable\" by watching every detail of that play as a new season neared, one with the promise of putting the bad memories of a three-win disaster in the rearview mirror. But with the Bears now at 0-4 after losing their 14th straight on Sunday, and more receiver drama unfolding with Chase Claypool, the echoes of a defining quote reverberated through Halas Hall.\nIt's the 15th anniversary of ex-Bears receiver Muhsin Muhammad telling Sports Illustrated that Chicago \"is where receivers go to die.\"\n• The rise of Commanders QB Sam Howell\n• Claypool adds to Bears' legacy of issues\n• Rookie QB Richardson's poise key for Colts\n• Bills offense chasing history\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\nSecond-year general manager Ryan Poles tried to change that narrative. He orchestrated a blockbuster trade in March, sending the No. 1 overall pick to the Carolina Panthers for a package that included DJ Moore, a true No. 1 receiver who's 26 and is being looked at to expedite the development of 24-year-old quarterback Justin Fields.\nBut as the Bears prepare for Thursday's rematch with the Commanders (8:15 p.m. ET, Prime Video), they rank 24th in passing yards (186.3 per game) after ranking last in 2022 (130.5). Moore is doing his part, ranking 14th at 75.3 receiving yards per game, but Mooney has eight catches total and Claypool's future in Chicago is in doubt.\nSeveral Bears receivers said they're aware of Muhammad's quote, and they believe the current unit could help change that perception. But history doesn't support their optimism. The Bears have had one first-team All-Pro receiver in the past 15 years in Brandon Marshall, and they've been unable to attract elite free agents because of a lack of quarterback consistency (18 starting QBs in the past 15 years) and a lack of success, with their last playoff win coming in 2011. One player agent said free agents take a hard look at who will be passing them the ball before signing.\n\"When you're talking about [wide receiver], it had been a huge issue for us because of the lack of stability at the most important position on the field,\" said Josh Lucas, the Bears' director of player personnel from 2015 to '22. \"We always knew as long as we didn't have an attractive quarterback that wide receivers wanted to come play with, we would be up against the eight ball.\"\nThe Bears acquired Claypool in a trade deadline move on Nov. 1, 2022, and he didn't come cheap. Chicago sent its second-round pick, which proved to be No. 32 overall -- essentially a first-rounder -- because Miami's first-rounder was stripped by a sanction.\nClaypool caught 18 passes for 191 yards and one score over 10 games for Chicago. His lackluster effort, especially when it came to blocking, was addressed by coach Matt Eberflus after a Week 2 loss. And Claypool's frustration was evident Friday when he said he didn't think he was being put in the best position to showcase his skill set. Two days later, he was a healthy scratch, although Eberflus said what Claypool said didn't have anything to do with him being inactive. He's also being asked not to attend team activities this week.\n\"We'll see where it goes from there,\" Eberflus said Monday. \"Ryan handles all those things, all those trades and transactions, and we'll see where it goes.\"\nConversely, Moore has been what the Bears needed. He had eight receptions for 131 yards and a touchdown Sunday to boost his season numbers to 19 catches, 301 yards and 2 TDs. He now has two games topping 100 receiving yards, becoming the first Bears receiver to do so in the first four weeks since Allen Robinson in 2020.\nMarshall said the connection between Fields and Moore reminds him of what he had with Jay Cutler.\n\"They have the chemistry already,\" Marshall said. \"You saw them in training camp.\"\nIf there was a silver lining Sunday for Chicago, it's that the offense showed some progress, especially Fields, who had his first 300-yard-passing game (335) and his first game with four passing touchdowns. The Bears entered Week 4 ranked 29th in yards per game at 250 and 26th in scoring at 15.7, and they gained 471 yards and scored 28. But that improvement did come against a Broncos team that yielded 70 points the previous week to the Miami Dolphins, and it did come in a 31-28 loss.\n\"When you're 0-4, no one's done the job well enough,\" Eberflus said. \"That's just facts.\n\"It's a results business, and we have to do a better job collectively as a group.\"\nWithout Claypool, there will be pressure on Mooney to regain his 2021 form, when he caught 81 passes for 1,055 yards and four TDs. But optimism about a Fields-Mooney connection faded last season when he caught 40 passes for 493 yards and two scores.\nThat's one of the reasons Mooney wanted to revisit the play vs. Washington: to learn from his mistakes. He was optimistic the addition of Moore would allow this group to rehabilitate the image of the Bears' receiving corps, but that was before the Claypool saga.\n\"I don't believe ... where it's like, 'Oh my goodness, this team is cursed,''' Marshall said in reference to Muhammad's quote. \"I just believe that you go out there and do your job.\"\nClaypool's absence also means receivers such as rookie Tyler Scott will have to contribute sooner than expected.\n\"I definitely heard [Muhammad's quote],\" Scott said. \"I don't put too much stock into it. That's how he felt, and that's his opinion.\n\"At the end of the day, each generation comes and everybody has a new opportunity. That's how I see it. Why can't you change that stigma or culture that Chicago may have, or that he felt that they had?\"\nMarshall and Alshon Jeffery were the Bears' most recent Pro Bowl receivers in 2013. In the nine seasons since, Chicago receivers have ranked 28th in targets, 31st in receiving yards and 30th in first-down receptions, and they are tied for 28th in receiving touchdowns.\nSince the start of modern NFL free agency in 1993, the Bears' biggest free agent acquisition at wide receiver was Robinson in 2018. Like Moore, Marshall had come via trade, and the Bears drafted Jeffery.\nLucas said the timing was perfect to sign Robinson. Mitch Trubisky, whom the Bears traded up to take at No. 2 overall, was entering his second season and Matt Nagy was taking over as head coach. Nagy had spent the previous 10 seasons under Andy Reid in Philadelphia and Kansas City.\nRobinson thrived with 1,147 yards and seven touchdowns in 2019 and 1,250 yards and six TDs the following year. But Trubisky left as a free agent for the Buffalo Bills in 2021, and Robinson grew unhappy over his contract situation and left as a free agent for the Los Angeles Rams last season.\nThe Bears are hoping Fields can develop into the type of quarterback who can attract free agents, but there's another scenario in which Fields' future may lie elsewhere. It's possible the Bears could land the No. 1 overall pick for the second year in a row. Chicago not only has its No. 1 pick, but also Carolina's. The Bears and Panthers are the only 0-4 teams in the NFL.\nIf that happens, the Bears would be in position to draft the overwhelming choice for the top pick in USC quarterback Caleb Williams, which would put Fields on the trading block.\nAnd while Williams might help attract free agents, it would mean another spin on the QB revolving door. Muhammad's frustration with the Bears was linked to the quarterback carousel he dealt with over three seasons (2005-07), having played with Kyle Orton, Rex Grossman, Brian Griese and Jeff Blake. That played a role in Muhammad's output taking a step back from the first nine years of his career in Carolina, where he earned first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors.\n\"We'd have to take a hard look at who's playing quarterback for them before signing with Chicago,\" one agent told ESPN. \"Few receivers can truly produce no matter [who's throwing them the ball], and even then there's no guarantee that will continue if the quarterback situation isn't good.\n\"I wouldn't be doing my job if I got them to a place where their career could fall off a cliff.\"\nESPN Jets reporter Rich Cimini contributed to this report."}

(1:48)\nThe NFL on Wednesday defended its recent coverage of pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce amid backlash from fans and even Kelce himself, who said the league is \"overdoing it\" with its attention toward the duo's rumored romance.\nSwift has attended the Chiefs' past two games, including their 23-20 win over the New York Jets on Sunday night at MetLife Stadium, which was the most watched Sunday show since the Super Bowl with an average of 27 million TV viewers, according to NBC Sports.\nThe broadcast featured ads for the forthcoming concert film \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" and on several occasions cut to Swift, who cheered on the Chiefs enthusiastically from her luxury box seats, while commentators made references to her song lyrics.\nThe NFL has played along, particularly on its social media accounts.

(0:22)\nThe NFL is considering discipline against Seattle Seahawks safety Jamal Adams for his actions toward an independent concussion doctor appointed by the league and NFLPA following his sideline evaluation in Monday night's game, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Wednesday.\nAdams, who was making his season debut against the New York Giants, was injured on the ninth play of the game when he took a knee to his helmet while trying to bring down a scrambling Daniel Jones.

(1:06)\nSAN DIEGO -- The Los Angeles Lakers might have the Nuggets on their minds this week, but Denver coach Michael Malone said the defending NBA champions have nothing but respect for the Lakers and have turned the page from the Western Conference finals sweep of Los Angeles.\nMalone was asked Wednesday about how some of the Lakers talked about his team this week and how they have been motivated by trash talk from Malone and the Nuggets all summer.\n\"Oh, they're talking about us? That was what, four months ago?\" Malone said after practice at the Nuggets' training camp at UC San Diego. \"I can't speak for anybody in L.A., but if they're still worried about us, that's on them.\n\"This is a new season, a new challenge, and it was a hell of a series against them. I know it was a 4-0 sweep, but all those games seemed like they went down to the wire. We have tremendous respect for that team. I have tremendous respect for Darvin Ham as a coach and the job that he did. But yeah, I don't listen to any of that stuff. I don't know what they're saying, and if we're on their minds, then I guess that's on them.\"\nThere certainly will be added spice to the season opener between the Nuggets and Lakers in Denver on Oct. 24. Anthony Davis told Spectrum SportsNet during Monday's media day that he found the trash talk from the Nuggets after their sweep of the Lakers to be \"motivational.\"\n\"There was just so much of that going on,\" Davis said. \"It was like, 'All right, we get it, y'all won.' But me and [LeBron James] had some conversations like, 'We can't wait [to play them again].'\"\nDuring the Western Conference finals, Malone said the narrative was much more about the Lakers than the Nuggets. After the sweep, Malone was asked whether he believed the Nuggets would be overshadowed by their Finals opponent, the Miami Heat, much like he felt about the national chatter being focused on the Lakers during the conference finals.\n\"If anybody is still talking about the Lakers in the NBA Finals, that's on them. They've gone fishing. We're still playing,\" Malone said before the Finals.\nAt the Denver championship parade, Malone was introduced as \"the Lakers' daddy.\" Also, during an interview on the \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" Malone joked that he was contemplating retirement after the win, a response to James telling ESPN he was considering retirement during the offseason.\nFormer Nuggets forward Bruce Brown, who signed with the Indiana Pacers as a free agent during the offseason, said on the \"Run Your Race\" podcast in July that it \"never felt like we were gonna lose any game\" when asked how close each contest was against the Lakers in the conference finals.\n\"I think everybody knows it was pointed at us,\" Lakers swingman Austin Reaves said of the Nuggets' comments after Tuesday's practice. \"They can do it indirectly if they want, but I think it was very obvious to the public eye. That's why everybody was talking about it.\"\nJames posted on his Instagram in June, without acknowledging Malone -- his former assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers -- by name: \"I hear I'm on your mind that much, huh??? I mean I guess I see why ... Enjoy your light but just know I'm the SUN.\"\nIn addition, Ham joined the \"This League Uncut\" podcast the following month and said, \"This s--- ain't over.\"\nMalone wasted no time on Monday's media day saying that Denver is leaving last season in the past and focusing on trying to repeat. The Nuggets, however, will spend one more night celebrating their title when they receive their rings and raise the championship banner before facing the Lakers in the opener.\nAs to whether there is a budding rivalry between the Lakers and Nuggets, who have faced each other twice in the Western Conference finals since 2020, Malone said no.\n\"That's not a rivalry,\" Malone said. \"I mean, you can't play a team in the Western Conference finals twice in the last couple of years and think it's a rivalry.\n\"When I think of rivalry, I think Boston-L.A. I think of the Knicks and the Miami Heat back in the day. But I don't welcome it or not welcome it [with the Lakers]. I'm on 2023-24. I'm not living four months ago.\""}

Left-hander Yusei Kikuchi, one of four Blue Jays who made 31 or more starts this season, was greeted by a single from Max Kepler. Pinch-hitter Donovan Solano walked, Carlos Correa put the Twins up with his single, and pinch-hitter Willi Castro's double-play groundout got another run on the board as Minnesota plated both its runs in what ultimately was a 2-0 series-clinching win.\nThe decision to remove Berrios was a hotly debated topic during the game and remained so after it.\n\"He had electric stuff. Tough to take him out,\" Schneider said. \"But I think with the way they're constructed, you want to utilize your whole roster. It didn't work out. You can look at it broadly and say it didn't work out because they scored two runs when we did make a change. You can also look at the fact it didn't work out and we didn't take advantage of at-bats we had with runners in scoring position.\n\"So you can sit here and second-guess me, second-guess the organization, second-guess anybody. I get that. I get that. And it's tough. And it didn't work out for us today or yesterday. But that's baseball sometimes. There's 29 teams that are going to say the same thing when the season's over.\"\nBerrios ended up throwing 47 pitches, allowing three hits and ultimately taking the loss.\n\"I just control what I can control,\" Berrios told reporters. \"I pitched my ass off.\n\"I understand the move [to remove him], and I have to deal with that.\"\nBlue Jays infielder Whit Merrifield said he didn't like what happened.\n\"I hated it, frankly,\" he said, according to SI.com. \"It's not what cost us the game, but it's the kind of baseball decisions that are taking away from managers and baseball, at this stage of the game.\"\nAdded Vlad Guerrero Jr. through an interpreter, via the Toronto Star: \"Obviously everybody was surprised. Everybody was surprised by the decision, but there are things you can't control. You can ask yourself many times, it was a hard decision, but yeah, we were surprised.\"\nToronto has now been swept in the wild-card round in two straight postseasons under Schneider and for the third time in four seasons overall.\n\"We got beat up two years in a row in the playoffs,\" Bo Bichette said. \"So I think there's a lot of reflection needed, from players but from the organization from top to down. Everybody needs to reflect to see what we can do better. So I think that's the next step.\"\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."}

{"title": "How Texas has gotten bigger, better under Steve Sarkisian", "date": "2023-10-05 13:32:58", "text": "Paul Finebaum breaks down the high stakes for Oklahoma and Texas in their upcoming matchup. (0:40)\nSteve Sarkisian had one key piece of feedback for athletic director Chris Del Conte when he studied his potential roster while interviewing for the Texas coaching job.\n\"We need bigger humans in our program, and we need more of them,\" he recalled at Big 12 media day in 2022. \"The numbers weren't the way I would've liked it and the body structure ... there's just a lot to it.\"\nSarkisian's first year seemed to bear that out. The Longhorns finished 5-7, and he said multiple times there needed to be a lot of new faces on the roster. And there was a reason: The Longhorns' highly touted recruiting classes in 2018 and 2019 brought in nine offensive linemen. But by Sarkisian's first year, four were no longer on the roster.\nNow, as No. 3 Texas sits at 5-0 heading into the annual Red River Rivalry showdown against No. 12 Oklahoma (noon ET, ABC/ESPN App), it'll be the biggest test to date of Sarkisian's project to return Texas to glory.\nLast year, Texas won the golden hat for the first time since 2018 in devastatingly dominant fashion, handing Oklahoma its biggest shutout loss in school history (49-0). It was the highest-scoring game for Texas in the 118-game series. But inconsistency plagued the Longhorns the rest of the season, going 4-3 from then on, en route to an 8-5 finish.\nSo far, those big humans are making their presence felt in Texas' strong start (its first 5-0 start since making the national title game in 2009). On defense, 6-foot-4, 362-pound T'Vondre Sweat is a run-stopping force who has helped the Longhorns allow just 3.07 yards per carry, their fewest in their first five games since 2010, according to ESPN Stats & Information. On the other side, an offensive line that returns all five starters from a year ago averages just over 6-4 and about 325 pounds. Texas is one of seven teams nationally to average more than 190 rushing yards (191.8) and allow fewer than 95 (94.6) per game.\nSarkisian's offense has always been the star attraction. It attracts talent, with his first recruiting class headlined by Ja'Tavion Sanders and Xavier Worthy, who instantly became two of Texas' best and flashiest offensive weapons. He added some strength the next year with DJ Campbell and Kelvin Banks, two of those offensive linemen, who were the most highly rated recruits in the '22 class, according to ESPN Recruiting.\nBut the biggest difference in this year's success over past years has been the defense, which will be tested by a Sooners offense that is No. 3 nationally in scoring (averaging 47.4 points) and No. 7 in passing (352.4 yards).\nThe Longhorns have added big pieces on that side of the ball. In 2023, linebacker Anthony Hill Jr. was a five-star signee who ranked behind only quarterback Arch Manning in the Texas class. He has already made a big impact with two sacks on third-down plays against Alabama, including on the Tide's final offensive drive to help Texas seal the win. Senior transfer Jalen Catalon came from Arkansas and has provided a physical presence at free safety, making seven tackles against Alabama and a big hit on Saturday against Kansas that led to a fumble.\nPlugging newcomers in alongside stars like Jaylan Ford, the preseason Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, has allowed the Longhorns the luxury of newfound depth to rotate heavily.\n\"I think it's been huge,\" Sarkisian said this week of the defense. \"We've gone through first halves of games where we played upwards of 30 guys. Sometimes you don't feel the effect of that rotation in the first half. But naturally, you look at some of these fourth quarters we've been having now. ... I think we're more fresh physically. We're more fresh mentally.\"\nAs a result, the defense is stifling opponents. Compared to their first five games over the past 20 years, the Longhorns are allowing the fewest yards per game since 2010 (290.8). They're pressuring opposing QBs on 37% of plays, best for the Longhorns since ESPN has been tracking the stat in 2011. Opposing QBs are off target on 18% of their passes and have completed just 53.5% of their passes.\nSenior Jahdae Barron said the players can trust that whoever is in the game can get the job done.\n\"When we look to the left and right of each other, we know that we are all brothers, and we've all been through so much throughout the summer, and we know that we are a family,\" Barron said. \"We've built a bond on and off the field so we know how to play for one another and we just keep playing.\"\nIt also has allowed the offense to keep from panicking. On Saturday, the Longhorns led Kansas just 13-7 at halftime. By the end of the game, it was 40-14.\nA year ago, it was likely either running back Bijan Robinson or receiver Worthy would be the stars quarterback Quinn Ewers had to lean on in key moments. On Saturday, Georgia transfer Adonai Mitchell had a career day, catching 10 passes for 141 yards and a touchdown, with Worthy adding seven catches for 93 yards.\nSophomore running back Jonathon Brooks has eclipsed the 100-yard mark in three straight games, including a 218-yard, two-touchdown performance against Kansas. Sanders, who was injured against the Jayhawks, should return and already has two 100-yard receiving games this year as a rare talent at tight end, with five catches for 114 yards against Alabama.\nMitchell was quick to say how much having Worthy on the other side helps him.\n\"It's crazy how much attention he gets and how the defense just has to respect who he is,\" Mitchell said. But Sarkisian said the presence of Mitchell is a difference-maker for Worthy, too.\n\"For Xavier to catch seven balls last year, it would take about 14 or 15 attempts in his direction because everybody knew we have to throw it there,\" Sarkisian said after the Kansas game. \"Now all of a sudden, when you have a complementary receiver on the other side, sooner or later people are going to start paying more attention to No. 5 [Mitchell] and with JT [Sanders] and with Jordan [Whittington] and now the running game with Jonathon the way he's running, now we've got a really good variety of players that the ball can get spread around to.\"\nOf course, all of that helps Ewers, who has an embarrassment of riches and doesn't have to do it all. He's averaging 271 passing yards per game with 10 touchdowns to just one interception. Opponents have gotten pressure on just 24% of his dropbacks, Texas' lowest rate since 2016.\nEwers also has started to trust his running ability when all those offensive threats attract coverage, rushing for 30- and 29-yard touchdowns in the past two games, two of his four rushing scores this year.\n\"He's figured out, 'Man, maybe I'm a little faster than I thought.'\" Sarkisian said.\nIt's all part of what Ewers said was a new dedication this offseason to getting in better shape.\n\"This is where I want to be,\" Ewers said. \"I think I took a lot of time analyzing myself last year and I want to be able to do stuff like this and I think I really worked on it this offseason. For it to start working out, it's pretty cool.\"\nSarkisian said on Monday he's preparing for a bit of a chess match against Oklahoma's Brent Venables, who he said has \"been doing it too long at too high of a level to think they weren't going to get that thing fixed\" after last year's 6-7 meltdown, in which they finished 122nd in total defense, allowing 461 yards per game.\n\"They've got a lot of defense,\" Sarkisian said. \"They've got a lot of coverages. They've got a lot of pressure packages. So you know, it's definitely challenging on that front. Especially when it's all on the same accord and working well together.\"\nBut Texas has been building for this moment. In the two titans' final season in the Big 12, they're both 5-0 for only the third time in the rivalry's history.\n\"We know it's going to be a great challenge,\" Sarkisian said. \"We're looking forward to it, looking forward to seeing our fans in Dallas for, in my opinion, the best setting in college football. This is going to be an awesome environment.\""}
{"title": "MLB Wild Card Series: Analysis and takeaways from a FOUR-sweep day!", "date": "2023-10-05 13:35:49", "text": "Well, that was fast!\nOn the second day of Wild Card week, all four series were decided: The Texas Rangers kicked off the day by eliminating the Tampa Bay Rays with a dominant 7-1 win, and the Minnesota Twins won their first playoff series since 2002 by sweeping the Toronto Blue Jays.The Arizona Diamondbacks knocked off the NL Central-winning Milwaukee Brewers, and the Philadelphia Phillies dominated the Miami Marlins in front of a raucous home crowd.\nWe've got you covered with our takeaways on each series -- and what's next for the four teams eliminated Wednesday.\nKey links: Day 1 | Everything you need to know | Bracket | Picks | Watch on ESPN, ABC\n\nTwins 2, Blue Jays 0: Sometimes the analysis is simple: The Twins pitched well, the Blue Jays didn't hit well -- and the Twins swept two low-scoring games for their first postseason series win since 2002. Give credit to a Minnesota pitching staff that has ability to make a deep postseason run. Pablo Lopez and Sonny Gray were both excellent in their starts and match up favorably with any team's top two starters. The bullpen has several guys who can pump it up into the upper 90s. That relief corps has the ability to be dominant this October (although manager Rocco Baldelli's insistence on using Louie Varland in high-leverage situations may bite him at some point). The question is whether the Twins can score enough runs -- but don't discount their chances of knocking off the Astros in the ALDS. As for the Jays, they remain without a postseason win in the Vladimir Guerrero Jr./Bo Bichette era, and you have to wonder whether the team needs a major offensive overhaul in the offseason. -- David Schoenfield\n\nRangers 7, Rays 1: Give the Rangers credit: They lost that last series of the season in Seattle, costing them the AL West title, and then had to fly cross-country to play a tough Rays team that had the best home record in the AL. We saw the best version of the Rangers, especially with Jordan Montgomery and Nathan Eovaldi combining to allow just one run in 17⅔ innings. We saw a lineup that has power up and down the lineup -- including rookie Evan Carter, who is having an October breakout.\nWhat we didn't learn: Can the bullpen close out a tight game? The starters went deep and the games weren't close. And manager Bruce Bochy's decision to bat Robbie Grossman third against right-handed starters, with some other good hitters to choose from, remains more than a little questionable given Grossman has hit .182 with a .569 OPS against righties the past two seasons. We'll see if that continues in Baltimore. -- Schoenfield\n\nArizona 5, Brewers 2: What we witnessed during a very brief NL wild card round in Milwaukee might well have been a young, talented team embarking on a new chapter in its history. Arizona's sweep was impressive -- not because its flashy athleticism was on full blast but because the team showed the big stage was not too big. It's a cliched observation to be sure, but it fits.\nThe Diamondbacks displayed professional, disciplined at-bats in both games. The quality of their at-bats improved as the games progressed, and they got to Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta the second time through the order. They did it with power, too, always a good formula for postseason winning.\nThe Arizona bullpen was impressive in the two games, with manager Torey Lovullo showing no compunction about trotting out a parade of guys you've probably never heard of. But Kevin Ginkel, Joe Mantiply, Miguel Castro and others have all gotten rolling late in the season -- and when a bullpen gathers steam in the playoffs, anything can happen.\nTo be sure, it's a gut-punch loss for Milwaukee, which squandered numerous scoring chances with multiple runners on base and so come away from a 94-win season with little to show for it. But credit for that perhaps goes to Arizona too, which did an outstanding job managing situations. If the D-Backs keep that up over the next week, this matchup against the heavily favored Dodgers might be an awful lot of fun. -- Bradford Doolittle\n\nPhillies 7, Marlins 1: The Phillies dominated in all phases of the game in their sweep of the Marlins. In Game 2, Aaron Nola cruised through seven scoreless innings and the offense ripped out six extra-base hits, including a 110-mph home run from J.T. Realmuto and a Bryson Stott grand slam to break the game open. Can we read too much into these two games? Not really, as the Marlins had the weakest offense of any of the playoff times. Still, the Phillies certainly look like the team that rolled through the NL side of the bracket last season -- except this team is a little deeper, better defensively and still has that raucous home crowd behind them. This sets up what could be the most exciting series of the postseason: Phillies versus Braves. The Braves won the season series 8 to 5, including four out of seven in September.

This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- DoolittleHouston AstrosNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champsALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield Ready for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000.

If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- DoolittleMinnesota TwinsNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champsALDS opponent: Astros (46.7% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 10.5% | Caesars odds: +2000Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins stay healthy enough? Everything went Minnesota's way in the opening round, but health remains a question. Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis. Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- GonzalezEditor's PicksPassan: Why all 12 MLB playoff teams can win the World Series -- and which one actually will3dJeff PassanOctober ace tiers: Ranking the top 15 starting pitchers for the 2023 MLB playoffs5dKiley McDanielAn A+ for the O's ... and SIX F's!? Full regular-season grades for all 30 MLB teams8dDavid Schoenfield2 RelatedWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- DoolittleTexas RangersNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild cardALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- SchoenfieldHow the Rangers got to OctoberAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »Passan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- DoolittleNational LeagueAtlanta BravesNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champsNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- SchoenfieldThe year of the HR-crushing BravesCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.MLB execs on how to beat Atlanta » Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- SchoenfieldWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- DoolittleLos Angeles DodgersNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champsNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 23The one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- GonzalezL.A.'s dominant transition yearCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs. Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs » 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- DoolittlePhiladelphia PhilliesNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild cardNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- GonzalezEarly MLB free agency rankingsNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason. Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- DoolittleArizona DiamondbacksNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild cardNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- SchoenfieldHow the D-backs learned to contendWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »Passan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle\n\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers (50.2% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista.

Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\n\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\n\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}
{"title": "WNBA Finals predictions: Can Aces repeat or will Liberty win first title?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:53:43", "text": "Seven of 18 WNBA Finals have gone the distance since the best-of-five format started in 2005. With the top two seeds and preseason favorites playing for the 2023 WNBA championship, will we see an eighth rendition of a winner-take-all Game 5 when the Las Vegas Aces face the New York Liberty?\nWe couldn't ask for a better setup, with a matchup of superstars in their primes -- Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson and New York's Breanna Stewart -- as two teams with the top talent and what appears to be the best chemistry meet. The Finals will begin Sunday in Las Vegas at 3 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN App.\nThe most recent five-game WNBA Finals was in 2019, when the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun. That was a matchup of the top two teams in the standings, as was the case in 2016 and 2017, when the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx went the distance and alternated in taking home the trophy.\nThis season, the Liberty beat the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup final, while the teams split their four regular-season meetings. They played four times in August, so those games are still fresh in their minds.\nAlmost anywhere you look in this series, you'll see a No. 1 pick or an MVP or a statistical leader -- or someone who is all three.\nBoth coaches are former WNBA players; Las Vegas' Becky Hammon led the Aces to the league title last year, while New York's Sandy Brondello guided the Phoenix Mercury to the 2014 championship.\nThe fan bases come at this from a different perspective. The Aces' franchise dates to the start of the WNBA in 1997 as the Utah Starzz, but their time in Las Vegas has been short and successful. They moved from San Antonio to the Strip in 2018, and they are appearing in the Finals for the third time.\nNew York, on the other hand, is the only still-existing original WNBA franchise that has not won a title. While the Liberty players -- none of whom has been with the team since before 2019 -- might not really feel that historical weight, the longtime Liberty fans do.\nSo which superteam will be the 2023 champion? ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel preview the Finals.\nVoepel: Stewart's shooting woes have been a surprise. She was at 46.5% overall and 35.5% from behind the arc in the regular season. In the Liberty's six playoff games, those percentages have dropped to 35.6 and 20.7. Of course, if she got a lot of her misses out of the way before the Finals, that's good news for the Liberty.\nPhilippou: Having covered the Liberty-Sun series in person, New York seemed to develop grit in real time to overcome a 0-1 deficit versus an uber-tough Connecticut squad and win three straight games, including two at Mohegan Sun Arena. Different people stepped up in different moments for the Liberty, but for the most part, they stayed poised to close out such a competitive series in four games.\nI am surprised the Liberty's bench hasn't seen more minutes in the playoffs, since their depth seemed to be an advantage when considering New York as a contender earlier this season. Does that change against the Aces? Kayla Thornton's toughness and energy can turn around a game, as can Marine Johannes' shooting, and Stefanie Dolson adds post depth against a team that doesn't have a ton of it. Johannes had a stellar outing versus the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup championship, but she has played only 42 minutes this postseason.\nPelton: In addition to seconding what Alexa said, I agree Stewart's postseason slump has been a surprise. When the Seattle Storm lost to Las Vegas in last year's semifinals, it was the first time a healthy Stewart had been knocked out of the playoffs since 2017. And even then, Stewart set a playoff record with 42 points in the final game of a hard-fought series. Going back to UConn, and including EuroLeague competition, Stewart has almost always been at her best when the stakes are the highest. They don't come much higher than in this series.\nPhilippou: Yes, the Finals are a whole new series, but those games -- particularly the August ones -- showed us a lot about how these teams match up. That said, I expect Wilson to play closer to how she did Aug. 28 against the Liberty (23 points) than say how she fared Aug. 6, when she tallied nine points on 2-for-14 shooting and tweeted, \"I doubt I'll ever shoot 2-14 again I pray I don't lol.\" Since then, she has shot below 40% just once, and she has been playing on another level over the past two months or so. The Liberty have excellent defenders in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, but they'll still have their hands full trying to slow down Wilson.\nVoepel: The Aces' 98-81 victory over the Liberty on June 29 doesn't have much bearing on this series, as Candace Parker was still playing for the Aces, and Jones wasn't quite in the playing form she is now. The other four matchups, all in August, are likely indicative of what we will see in the Finals. The Aces didn't play well in their first game in Brooklyn nor in the Commissioner's Cup final in Las Vegas. Those will be games the Aces will review in preparation because they were far from their best in both.\nThe Aces and Liberty split their regular-season series, but New York beat Las Vegas in their Aug. 15 Commissioner's Cup championship game, which doesn't count toward WNBA standings or statistics. While the Aces are 2-3 against New York, they went 37-4 against the rest of the league, and only the Liberty had multiple wins against Las Vegas, per ESPN Stats & Information.\nPelton: It's interesting that head-to-head results haven't been particularly predictive of Finals results. Since the WNBA went to a single playoff table in 2016, and not including the shortened 2020 Wubble season, teams that won the regular-season series have gone just 2-4 in the Finals. And both of those winners, the 2018 Storm and last year's Aces, also had home-court advantage in the Finals. However, we've never seen teams play each other this often before the Finals. All of those previous head-to-head series were three games rather than the five times Las Vegas and New York have already met this year.\nPelton: Given the firepower on both sides, I think it's more about which team can consistently get stops. New York was 15-0 in the regular season (and 1-0 so far in the playoffs) when holding opponents to 95 points per 100 possessions or fewer. One of those games was the Aug. 6 blowout win over Las Vegas that represented the Aces' worst offensive performance of the season in terms of points per possession -- and the Liberty's best on defense.\nPhilippou: Defensively, for the reasons Pelton stated, but also because if you ask both Hammon and Brondello, they'd say defense wins championships. Not just by the pure nature of getting stops and keeping an opponent off the scoreboard, but for these two teams in particular, defense (and defensive rebounding) fuels offense on the other end, especially in transition.\nThe Aces have had the best defensive rating in both the regular season and playoffs, but they allowed the Liberty to score at least 80 points in all of their previous meetings except one -- Aug. 17, the only time Las Vegas beat New York in their four matchups that month.\nTop-seeded Las Vegas and No. 2 seed New York dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, they ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nVoepel: The Aces have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Wilson, but she has given much praise to Kiah Stokes as the true anchor of Las Vegas' defense. The Aces' Jackie Young is one of the league's best defensive guards and at 6 feet tall actually can take on just about anyone. Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark is also a versatile defender.\nIt makes sense to say defense will prevail in this series, for all the reasons Alexa and Kevin point out. Still, let's add this: The Aces can be like a runaway train on offense, and that can take over games. The Aces won playoff games scoring 97 points and 64 points, which shows how effective they can be on both ends of the court.\nPhilippou: Jones' emergence into her MVP-level self is arguably the single biggest development that has catapulted this Liberty team into a contender. In the postseason, she has had six double-doubles in as many games; and in the second half alone of Game 4 in the semifinals, Jones came up with 20 points and eight rebounds.\nGoing up against the Mystics' and Sun's frontcourts is different than facing that of the Aces' (especially with Wilson being unstoppable as of late). But if Jones can play like she did in New York's August meetings versus Las Vegas, the Liberty are much better positioned to win.\nAnother X factor is Liberty forward Betnijah Laney, who has scored at least 19 points in all but one of New York's postseason games and will be critical to helping contain the Aces' high-powered guards.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nVoepel: Jones is the biggest X factor overall in the series. The biggest for Las Vegas is Kelsey Plum's 3-point shooting, because that can really fuel the Aces. Plum averaged 2.4 3s per game and shot 38.9% from behind the arc in the regular season; during the Aces' five playoff games, she was at 3.2 and 42.1%. Plum, Young and Chelsea Gray all can do damage from long range, but if Plum gets in a groove, it makes Las Vegas' offense all the harder to stop.\nPelton: Stokes. Over the course of the season, as well as the playoffs, the Aces' starting lineup with Stokes in place of the injured Parker -- the group that led Las Vegas to last year's title -- has remained dominant.\nHowever, that hasn't been the case against the Liberty. In 45 minutes across the five meetings, the Aces were outscored by 19 points with their starting five on the court. Although Hammon can always go small with Clark in Stokes' place, not being able to keep Stokes on the court will leave Las Vegas painfully thin.\nPhilippou: Liberty in 5. I went back and forth and wouldn't be shocked to be proved wrong. But at the end of the day, it's hard to ignore how much the Liberty dominated the Aces in their most recent meetings in August. Plus, New York had a much tougher road to the championship series, and being battle-tested will pay off. Jones won MVP of the Commissioner's Cup championship game thanks to her dominance in the paint on both ends and on the glass, and I project her to take home Finals MVP should the Liberty win.\nVoepel: Aces in 5. This feels like the 2016 and 2017 Lynx-Sparks Finals, when there was such a good case for both teams to win both years. They split, with the Sparks winning in 2016 and the Lynx in 2017. The Sparks won 2016's Game 5 on Minnesota's home court, which is so hard to do in the clinching game of a playoff series. Then the Lynx won in Minneapolis in 2017's Game 5 -- although at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena, because Target Center was being refurbished. The WNBA's most recent Finals Game 5 was in 2019, when Washington beat Connecticut on the Mystics' home court.\nIt seems like this year, the Aces -- who celebrated their 2022 title in Connecticut -- might win it at home.\nPelton: Liberty in 4. That's not a reflection on how close the series might be, but lower-seeded teams that have won the Finals in the best-of-five era have been more likely to close out at home than win a Game 5 on the road. If Parker were healthy, I'd be inclined to pick Las Vegas. But New York has been the (slightly) better team since the All-Star break, and I don't expect Stewart's shooting slump to carry over into the Finals.\nRamona Shelburne: Aces in 5. Las Vegas misses Parker, and this matchup is going to be difficult. But the Aces are the defending champs until someone takes the title from them. You've got to knock them off, and that's difficult over a best-of-five series."}

Only Green spoke up. \"We need you to be better,\" Green continued. \"You're supposed to show us how to do this.\"\nGreen was calm and measured, witnesses recall.\n\"He did it from a place of, 'I'm seeking knowledge,'\" John Lucas, the longtime Rockets assistant coach who now works in the front office, told ESPN. \"It made Jalen a leader among the younger guys.\"\nThere was no retort, no heated back-and-forth. \"The truth has no feelings,\" Lucas said.\n\"It was about showing everyone needs to be held accountable,\" Green told ESPN.\nEighteen months later, Green is the highest draft pick and headliner of one of the NBA's deepest pools of young talent -- the product of three straight losing seasons in which the Rockets won just 59 combined games and prioritized their own first-round picks.\nIn Green, Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, Houston has six high-wattage prospects -- including three top-four picks in Thompson, Smith, and Green. The Rockets have surrounded them with veterans in Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jeff Green, and Jock Landale. (They nearly snagged Brook Lopez from the Milwaukee Bucks, sources said.)\nThe veterans are around to teach habits and help the Rockets win more; Houston owes its 2024 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, protected for the top four draft slots -- the first of two painful debts stemming from the Daryl Morey regime's ill-fated 2019 swap of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook in a desperate bid to placate Harden. By the cold reality of incentives, the losing has to stop.\nMeanwhile, Houston's front office already has to look years ahead: Is it even possible to pay all six of those young guys second contracts under this new collective bargaining agreement -- even with restricted free agency still a powerful cudgel? If none of those players becomes a No. 1-level superstar, how do the Rockets find one? Or does the talent fit so well as to compensate for the lack of that amorphous \"best player on a title team\" -- becoming (one day) one of those greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts contenders? What Green remains a low-percentage shooter who doesn't bring enough outside of points? What if the whole thing fizzles?\nRight now, Green probably represents their best chance at that superstar -- the apex ball handler. He has internal competition. Thompson has star potential. Smith surged last season, blew up in summer league, and seems poised for another leap in Year 2 on both ends. Sengun could be an All-Star-level producer on offense as soon as this season -- in part because of his promising two-man game with Green -- though Sengun has to reach a passable level on defense.\nBut Green has tantalizing scoring tools and a willingness, he and his coaches say, to lean into more of a playmaking role and to give more effort on defense. In Year 3, he now has to live the message he delivered to that would-be veteran mentor: play unselfishly, play hard, play defense -- always.\nVanVleet is the new point guard, but the Rockets still want the ball in Green's hands. (The Rockets have banished Kevin Porter Jr. from the team as he faces domestic violence charges. The basketball impact -- way down the list of what matters in the Porter case -- is that Green and the rest of Houston's young core will have more opportunities to handle the ball.)\nVanVleet's ability to work off the ball is one reason Houston's decision-makers, including new head coach Ime Udoka, preferred VanVleet over a free agency reunion with Harden.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.' If we want Jalen and the young guys to take the next steps, we need them to have the ball. As for me saying I don't want James, that was never the case. It was about fit.\"\nIt is on Green to pay off that faith by digging deeper into nonscoring aspects of the game.\n\"This is a huge year for him,\" Rafael Stone, the Rockets general manager, told ESPN. \"It's on him to really put together all the things he's worked on. You see individual games where he's locked in -- whether it's on-ball defense, help-side defense, making the right reads in the pick-and-roll. And then there are other games where he just kind of let go of the rope. He's a bucket. It's about all the little things.\"\nA lot of young lottery picks chase points. For some players and their agents, points are the best vehicle to that first big payday. But Houston's coaches are unanimous that Green can become more well-rounded in a season where winning has suddenly become a priority. And where Green ends up in three, four, five years along an unusually wide possibility of outcomes could make or break this new Houston experiment.\n\"He's growing into a pro,\" said Lucas, who worked closely with Green during his rookie season, tweaking Green's jumper and quickening the release. \"His savvy is coming. He's an absolute delight to work with.\"\nGreen said he's ready.\n\"I can contribute to winning,\" he told ESPN. \"I'm an all-around player.\"\nGREEN'S COMBINATION OF speed, burst, and leaping ability is rare even among players toward the top of the draft. During his 1-on-0 pre-draft workout with the Rockets, Green lost the ball on the way up during a layup drill, reached out in midair to snare it, and dunked with power. \"It was like, 'Holy s---, I haven't seen that one before,'\" Stone recalled. \"His athleticism popped. He has one of the highest ceilings of any player that has been drafted recently, and we are in the business of drafting for upside.\"\nOne executive from another team drafting around Green's range told his front office that Green could lead the league in scoring one day.\n\"I have never coached anyone like him,\" Brad Roznovsky, who coached Green for three years at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno, California, told ESPN. \"And I never will again.\"\nAt age 20 on a rebuilding Rockets team -- facing elite defenders almost every game -- Green averaged 22 points and almost four assists. He knifed his way to six free throws per game. Some high-usage ball handlers never average that many free throws. Green was inefficient, but he is on a clear All-Star trajectory.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nRival executives often project his potential peak as similar to those of Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and some statistical models suggest those as decent comparisons. They are also close to Green's height (6-foot-4), a tick shorter than the big wing ball-handlers who often rule the league.\nBeal and LaVine have made five combined All-Star teams, and that number should jump. Beal made one All-NBA team. Those are objectively good outcomes, even for a much-hyped No. 2 pick with Green's scoring chops.\nBut neither has ever been the No. 1 option on a dangerous postseason team. Beal is now the third option on a contender in the Phoenix Suns. LaVine's Chicago Bulls have flatlined in mediocrity. The Rockets aren't putting any ceiling on Green yet, and they shouldn't.\nStill, there is an enormous gap between where Green is now and All-Star-level efficiency. Green shot 41.6% last season -- 33.8% on 3s, 47.1% on 2s. He converted just 55% at the rim.\nThere is low-hanging fruit to pluck. Green chucks up a lot of low-chance jumpers early in the clock when one pass or dribble would keep the offense chugging toward something better.\nGreen has taken (by a hair) more pull-up 3s than catch-and-shoot treys in his career, per NBA.com. He's capable of hitting those shots, but too many come early in possessions. Some are off-balance, over multiple defenders.\n\"There were just too many possessions where he took poor shots with three guys on him,\" Udoka said.\nAlmost one-third of Green's shots in 2022-23 were midrangers, a ton by the standards of the analytics-heavy Rockets. The team is fine with those looks late in the shot clock. They know elite defenses sometimes snuff everything else. Green hit 42% on long 2s last season, and has a knack for stopping on a dime, rising into the clouds, and generating clean on-balance looks. With more judiciousness, that percentage could climb into the high-40s.\nBut the team would like Green to bag contested pull-up 2s that come with time left to explore.\n\"What's important for Jalen is making sure he takes virtually none of those,\" Stone said. \"If that shot [a long 2] is contested, there has to be a better shot for someone else.\"\nOn some of those plays, the right pass is in front of him:\nWatch Sengun roll free then turn his palms to the sky in exasperation after Green jacks a long 2 with 12 seconds on the shot clock instead of threading the pocket pass.\nWhat's both encouraging and frustrating is that Green has those passes in his bag. When trapped, Green is happy to slip the ball to an open teammate immediately.\nThere are plenty of instances of Green making the basic pocket pass as soon as it opens:\nThen just a minute later -- as in that game against the Bulls -- Green might ignore that identical pocket pass in favor of a wayward drive, or toss it too late:\nGreen attempted shots on about 47% of his pick-and-rolls that resulted in the end of possessions -- 43rd among 174 ball handlers who ran at least 200 such plays, per Second Spectrum. Green dished assists on only 9.8% of those actions -- 163rd among that 174-player sample.\nGreen is determined to find a better pass-or-shoot balance.\n\"It's simple reads,\" Green said. \"The pocket pass to Alpie [Sengun], or if the low man helps over, hitting that shooter in the corner.\"\nGREEN SPENT MUCH of the summer in Los Angeles, training with a personal coach -- Adam Harrington, a former assistant for both the Thunder and the Nets -- and participating in 5-on-5 runs with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and other NBA stars. Udoka watched a lot of those pickup games, including one in which Green and Smith were on the same team -- facing a squad that included both Durant and Booker.\n\"In my mind, it was Houston against Phoenix,\" Udoka said. He saw progress in Green's passing.\n\"He has the ability to make the right play,\" Udoka continued. \"You don't always see it on a young team where it's your turn, my turn, and guys are taking poor shots at times. But when the level of talent is raised around him, he makes the right reads. Now there are no excuses. I've seen you do it.\"\nObserving those pickup games, Udoka would sometimes shout for Green to set a flare screen or cut to the rim. Green has flashed some instincts to cut back door when Sengun -- a clever passer -- has the ball at the elbow. Those plays hint at a decent feel -- something that should translate to passing.\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBut they were mere flashes. Houston's offense last season was stagnant. Porter and Green pounded the air out of the ball. On some possessions, they had to wait several seconds before a Houston big man realized he should run up to set a screen. There was no structure, no pace. Spacing was cluttered.\n\"There was a lot of standing around,\" Udoka said.\nLike a lot of young guards, Green sometimes dribbled around the arc without purpose -- bobbing and weaving in the general area of picks without going anywhere. He sometimes rushed through moves, zooming forward before really executing them -- before giving defenders a chance to take the bait.\nVanVleet should loosen spacing and allow Green to attack more off the catch -- with the floor in motion. \"We want to use him more off the ball,\" Udoka said of Green. \"We want him coming off screens and slashing. I don't know if it's natural for him, but you've seen glimpses.\"\nSpacing remains a challenge. Defenses will ignore both Brooks and Eason on the perimeter until they prove themselves as shooters; against certain Houston lineups, defenses had centers guard Eason and hang near the paint. (Eason, by the way, has a chance to be a really good two-way player. He seems to have magnets in his hands, sucking up steals and rebounds that appear out of reach. The Rockets are optimistic he can do more with the ball on offense.) With Sengun and Landale, it might be hard for Udoka to get to lineups in which Smith plays small-ball center.\nGreen oozes ballhandling craft that he is just starting to harness. He can lull defenders to sleep with languid hesitation dribbles toward picks, and then dust them by darting away from those screens. He works nasty in-and-out dribbles with either hand:\nGreen is slim, but at 6-foot-4 with his speed and leaping ability, he could develop a Westbrook-esque style of turbocharged drives through smaller point guard defenders:\nGreen can get to the rim almost at will. His approach and judgment once there has been addled. Green has a habit of flying at rim protectors without a plan and throwing up wild, flailing hope shots.\n\"You have to know where your dump-offs are,\" Udoka said. \"Jalen is used to being able to finish over anyone, but if you get separation and Joel Embiid is sitting in the paint, you can take the midranger instead of attacking him.\"\nIN OFFSEASON WORKOUTS, Harrington slowed everything down and had Green walk through the final two or three steps of every typical action over and over: planting to catch the ball running off a pick; rising for a contested layup; leaping for a pull-up 3; loading off one foot to take a Ray Allen-style leaning jumper.\n\"It was about balance,\" Green said. Harrington wanted Green to feel what each foot should be doing -- to download the body mechanics so that he is comfortable, strong, and poised in every situation.\nThat could lead to more plays where it all comes together:\nThere are not many 20-year-olds who can work all those skills -- all those changes of direction and cadence -- into one pick-and-roll. Green slithers to his right around that Sengun screen then slows down to pin his defender on his hip -- waiting for Sengun to find space. Green veers left, then back right -- finally getting Xavier Tillman to commit and unlocking that hook pass.\nGreen spent a lot of time in L.A. around Durant, watching him work and listening to Durant's advice. Durant told Green that every practice and drill should mimic game intensity.\n\"That's what stuck with me -- to really make everything game-like,\" Green said.\nThe harder work comes on defense. Green has been a pretty glaring minus on that end. Bigger opponents have bullied him, and Green has gotten lost now and then in rotation.\nBut Green can become at least an average defender. He has good length, and he seems to care. His lean frame has its advantages. Harrington developed a mantra for him: Avoid every screen.\n\"We've argued a lot,\" Lucas said about Green when the subject turned to defense. \"Jalen can guard when he wants to. He just hasn't been required to yet.\"\n(Lucas loves needling Green to get under his skin and motivate him. He sometimes asks Green where he was selected in the draft. When Green replies that he was the second pick, Lucas -- the top pick in 1976 -- boasts that he might have already been at the after party or even asleep by the time the second pick rolled around in his draft. \"He gets so mad,\" Lucas said, laughing. When Lucas finds out Green admires an opposing player -- De'Aaron Fox and Anthony Edwards, as examples -- he tells Green that if he is such a fan, Lucas can walk to the opponent locker room and ask for a pair of signed shoes.)Top stories of the week from Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\n\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nDefense is not optional under Udoka. \"Defense is more of a mentality,\" the coach said. \"He will be challenged a lot more.\"\nUdoka spares no one in film sessions. \"You'll get called out if you are the weak link,\" Udoka said. \"I'll call him out in front of the whole team. I'm equal opportunity in that.\"\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the mental and physical burden of being a true NBA superstar. Entire defenses are designed to stop you. They change schemes several times within quarters, trying to get in your head. Every possession involves a half-dozen small decisions, all made under pressure. You have to at least execute on defense. And you have to do it 82 times -- and then 10 or 15 or 20 more times in the postseason, when the talent is better, the coaching is more targeted, and everything is done with more urgency.\nLucas is confident. \"In another year, he will really be a professional,\" Lucas said of Green. \"Next season [2024-25], he is going to take off like Ja Morant and Devin Booker.\"\nEven optimists know how much distance lies between where Green is now and where those guys -- and Beal, even LaVine -- have reached. Perhaps it's best to approach this season with smaller goals.\n\"I want to be better for my teammates,\" Green said. \"I'm always going to be able to score. Now, it's more about contributing to my team in other ways.\""}
{"title": "VAR doesn't work without enough cameras and angles -- just ask the NWSL", "date": "2023-10-05 14:48:00", "text": "On the same day that the Premier League had what became a defining blunder for VAR in a high-profile match, the National Women's Soccer League was having just another weekend in its bumpy first season using video replays.\nAmong the calls in question were a penalty that was unconvincingly reversed after review in Chicago and, the next day, an equalizing goal in Seattle that OL Reign coach Laura Harvey insisted afterward was offside. The problem with both decisions was not entirely human error, but the lack of technology available with which the hard-working (and underpaid) humans could make the right decision.\nBoth decisions had major implications on the tightest NWSL playoff race in history. A probable 1-0 Reign win was turned into a 1-1 draw. Racing Louisville could've pulled level, but instead the Chicago Red Stars won, 1-0. VAR, or video-assisted refereeing, was introduced to ensure such calls are right, but it may have done the opposite.\nNone of this drama is new for the NWSL, where defining offside calls are made weekly without truly definitive angles. In Seattle on Sunday, Kerolin's equalizer for the North Carolina Courage stood after a five-plus minute review by referee Elton Garcia -- the official had to try to analyze an offside line from a horrendous angle that was anything but in line with the last defender.\nUnlike in that crucial moment of Saturday's Liverpool-Tottenham game, NWSL referees are not armed with two-dimensional lines to draw across a replay. They do not have the benefit of semi-automated offside, which was used at the 2023 World Cup. They also do not have goal-line technology, nor any cameras on the end lines to provide a definitive angle on would-be goals (which, you guessed it, has been an issue in the NWSL this season).\nInstead, they are at the mercy of the camera angles that they have, which often are not enough to truly make a definitive call on where the offside line is. By the letter of the law -- that a decision must include a \"clear and obvious error\" to be reversed -- NWSL referees are often handcuffed to the call made on the field for lack of sufficient video evidence. Except when they are not.\nOn Saturday in Chicago, with Racing Louisville trailing the Red Stars in the second half, Louisville midfielder Savannah DeMelo was taken down in the box by Chicago midfielder Julia Bianchi. Referee Sergii Demianchuk pointed to the spot for a penalty kick, which looked obvious in real time. The next four minutes were spent in consultation with the VAR, Luis Guardia, and included an extended look at the makeshift monitor setup on a rolling media cart at midfield in SeatGeek Stadium.\n\"This is one of the most important VAR decisions of the entire season,\" commentator Mike Watts said on the broadcast during the stoppage. As Demianchuk emerged from the monitor to deliver the verdict, Watts added: \"Here is a season-changing decision.\"\nDemianchuk jogged back to the penalty area, made the universal \"TV\" sign for VAR review, and motioned for a drop ball. No penalty.\nThe decision was shocking, not so much in that it was an egregious error but because there appeared to be no evidence to support the determination of a clear and obvious error. Bianchi most certainly makes contact with DeMelo in the box. Exactly how much and how forcefully -- or whether she mostly gets the ball -- could only be determined by a reverse angle that did not exist. (Viewers at home are privy to the same replays that appear on the monitor for the referee's review.)\nIf the call on the field was a penalty, it should have stood based on the evidence available.\nAsked by a pool reporter after the game why the call was overturned, and what the clear and obvious error was, Demianchuk's written response was: \"The defender played the ball prior to making contact with the opponent.\"\nThis is not about one referee or one incident, to be clear. VAR's rollout in the NWSL has been hit-and-miss since the opening weekend when Angel City FC was twice on the wrong end of harsh decisions that changed the entire complexion of a home match against NJ/NY Gotham FC.\nEarlier in September during a video review of a goal, referee Alyssa Nichols asked whether a player interfered with an opponent and the assistant VAR said, \"We would need a different angle.\" No other angle was shown to Nichols and Angel City was awarded a goal. Professional Referee Organization later said the goal should not have counted because the player did interfere with an opponent.\nVAR is both a solution and another layer of complication -- that is not unique to the NWSL. What is unique to the NWSL is that VAR has arrived without ample technological support.\nAll NWSL games in 2023 use HD cameras and fiber transmission, according to a league spokesperson. The rare games aired on CBS, including Friday's farewell to Megan Rapinoe and the NWSL Championship scheduled for Nov. 11, utilize 14 cameras. Games that air on CBS Sports Network and that are streamed on Paramount+ have only six cameras, two more than they did for most of last season.\nThe slight numerical increase and improvement to broadcast-quality cameras happened in August 2022 in response to increasing problems with match streams. It was a product fix that also ostensibly helped with the implementation of VAR. All those upgrades likely cost seven figures.\nPerhaps we've entered the era of champagne problems for the NWSL, which is part of becoming big-time as the league wants to (and should) be. Thus far, \"more\" is still not enough. Premier League games, to use the most extreme example, are captured by at least 30 cameras. MLS had a previous minimum of eight cameras per broadcast.\nIn that light, some of the issues with VAR in NWSL -- emphasis on \"some,\" because there are still plenty of improvements to be made in the officiating overall -- can be viewed through the lens of the league's inadequate media rights deal.\nLynn Williams joins \"Futbol Americas\" to talk about why the USWNT failed at the FIFA Women's World Cup.\nCBS reportedly paid $4.5 million for a three-year contract that expires in the coming months. (It was extended by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic canceling the 2020 regular season.) The NWSL -- as in, the owner/operators of each franchise collectively, along with whatever sponsorship money comes in from league headquarters -- foots the bill to produce games.\nLast month, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said she hopes to be able to announce the future of the league's media rights before the NWSL Championship. The league has been in search of a big payday for its next rights deal, but it is seeking that in an unpredictable market filled with media layoffs -- all while new, unproven players in the space unpredictably splash cash on certain properties.\nLeague sources say that a means to an end could involve multiple rights holders to maximize the return from each -- as in, go find the NWSL on multiple channels. Solutions could be confirmed in the coming weeks. Whatever those are, they matter for more reasons than just where fans can find games, and how good the broadcast is.\nVAR has been a good step toward accountability in a league that long lacked it in so many departments. It will require time and continued training to improve the process. It will also require the league to double down on investment in technology to support it."}
{"title": "'Bro, it's your defense': Alabama lost a superstar and somehow got better, thanks to Dallas Turner", "date": "2023-10-05 15:32:17", "text": "On SEC This Morning, host Peter Burns claims he can make Dallas Turner rage quit a game of Madden while they chat about his hobbies off the football field. (3:41)\nAS JALEN MILROE gets more comfortable at quarterback, as the offensive line gets its act together, as penalties and turnovers continue to mount and an offensive identity only now begins to come into focus, one thing has kept the Alabama dynasty on life support and within earshot of the playoff conversation: its defense.\nThrough five games -- admittedly a smallish sample size but not insignificant, either -- the Crimson Tide have given up 4.42 yards per play against FBS opponents, which ranks ninth nationally. Turnovers and pressures are up from last season. Opposing quarterbacks' ratings are down.\nIt has been a while since an Alabama defense has looked this good, on pace to allow fewer than 300 yards per game for the first time since 2017. Against Ole Miss two weeks ago, it held the Rebels to 10 points, their fewest in an SEC game under coach Lane Kiffin and well short of their previous average of 52.7 points per game. And lest that be labeled a fluke, Ole Miss hung 55 on LSU its next time out.\nLast weekend, Alabama kept Mississippi State quarterback Will Rogers, the SEC's No. 2 all-time leading passer, in check to the tune of 107 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. And lest that be labeled a fluke as well, Rogers was coming off 487 yards passing against South Carolina.\nDoes this all mean the return of vintage Nick Saban defenses? It's probably too soon to tell. We'll learn more Saturday when the Tide travel to Texas A&M (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS) for the first time since they gave up 41 points in a loss there two years ago. But while we wait, it may be time to ask an important question: How, after losing arguably the best defensive player in college football in Will Anderson, did the defense get better?\nCredit cornerbacks Malachi Moore and Terrion Arnold for stepping up. The same goes for linebackers Deontae Lawson and Chris Braswell. But the place to start is the man who on paper was tasked with replacing Anderson.\nDallas Turner spent the past two seasons quietly making a name for himself as one of the best young players in the country -- a blend of speed, agility and strength that's perfectly suited for the modern edge rusher. Playing opposite Anderson at outside linebacker, the South Florida native flourished in a role that was part sidekick, part understudy. His 12.5 sacks during that time were solid, ranking in the top 50 nationally, but they were dwarfed by Anderson and his FBS-best 27.5 sacks.\nWhen Anderson left for the NFL draft in January, he pulled Turner aside and told him pointedly, \"Bro, it's your defense.\"\nAnderson, drafted No. 3 overall, said he told Saban the same thing, stressing that the outside linebackers set the tone.\n\"[Turner] can be one of the best to come through Alabama,\" Anderson told ESPN. \"He would always say, 'Bro, I wanna do what you do.' And I always told him, 'Do better than what I did.' And I honestly believe he can do that, 100 percent.\"\nThat includes surpassing Anderson's 17.5 sacks and 34 tackles for loss as a sophomore, he said.\n\"I truly believe that,\" Anderson said. \"I know the type of hard work he puts in. I know his mentality. I know the grit and the love that he has for the game, that he can go out there and do all those things.\"\nAfter posting 3.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and a forced fumble against Ole Miss, Turner wore a T-shirt with a likeness of himself flexing in uniform. Soft-spoken, he let his attire do the work.\nWritten in all-caps above the cartoon image were the words, \"NO LIMIT.\"\nIt's what Turner feels about Alabama this season -- \"There's no limit to how good the defense can be,\" he said -- and how coaches feel about his potential as one of the most gifted edge rushers in college football.\nTURNER'S FOOTBALL ASCENSION was first written in code on a PlayStation outside of Seoul, South Korea. It was 2001, and Delon Turner was nearing the end of his professional career for Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus of the Korean Basketball League when he and a roommate passed the time during an off day by playing Madden.\nThey competed in full seasons against one another with simple rules. They each allowed the other to create one player and give that player an unlimited rating, making that player the best on the field.\nDelon's roommate created a running back and named him after his son, Jaylen. And because Delon couldn't tackle the 99-rated Jaylen with anyone on the roster, he made a 99-rated defensive end as a countermeasure.\nHe didn't have a son of his own yet, so he picked a name at random: Dallas.\nFast-forward two years and a return to the U.S., the name stuck. But the unique story of Dallas' birth didn't end there.\n\"As [my wife] was giving labor,\" Delon recalled, \"I was watching the Pro Bowl.\"\nThe stars aligned perfectly as Delon handed down not only his athletic ability but his work ethic as a professional athlete. Dallas seemed to understand the big picture at a young age, like when he gave up a promising basketball career, which had included a coveted Team USA invite, to focus on football. He went to American Heritage High School to get coached by former Miami Dolphin Pat Surtain. And sensing he needed a change of scenery before college, he transferred to St. Thomas Aquinas, where he would receive coaching from another former Dolphin, Jason Taylor, a first-ballot Hall of Famer and one of the best defensive ends to ever play the game.\n\"God blessed Dallas with a lot of talent and length and height and size,\" Taylor said. \"So you combine that with the skills learned on the basketball court -- your lateral movement, your foot quickness, your hand-eye coordination, instantaneously going from offense to defense and having to backpedal and turn and open your hips and roll and run and all the things -- and then you transplant that into a kid that has some dog in them and is highly, highly competitive and physical and hungry, it's a nasty combination.\"\nBut the thing Taylor said he appreciated most about Dallas was how open he was to coaching. Already a high-profile recruit once he got to St. Thomas Aquinas, Taylor said Dallas \"wanted to be pushed.\" So much so that Delon hired pass-rush specialist Javon Gopie to work with Dallas starting his sophomore season of high school. Gopie said Dallas told him right off the bat, \"These are the things I'm great at, but I want to be more intentional and become a smarter pass-rusher.\"\nWhen Nick Saban came calling, Taylor didn't sugarcoat what an Alabama offer meant. Taylor, who was coached by Saban for two years in the NFL and credits him with taking his career from good to great, told Dallas, \"You have to be willing to go there and work and grind and be coached hard.\"\n\"That place isn't for everybody,\" Taylor said, \"and he didn't shy away from it.\"\nDallas considered Georgia, Florida, Michigan and Oklahoma. But he said, \"My family trusted Nick Saban and the coaching staff over there to help me get where I need to go.\"\nDelon said there was one more factor that helped seal the deal.\nDelon recalled the family visiting campus for a game against No. 3 Georgia when a newcomer named Will Anderson stood out, racking up four tackles and a quarterback hurry. Anderson would go on to register seven sacks in his final six games as a true freshman.\nDallas told Delon after the game, \"If that guy can do it, I can do it.\"\nAnd then when it came to other colleges, \"everybody else was a distant second,\" Delon said.\nTURNER WAS QUIET when he got to Alabama. Naturally reserved, he watched Anderson and veterans like Chris Allen work and kept his distance at first.\nAnderson was having none of that, though, welcoming him to the team with some good-natured ribbing about his weight.\n\"Dallas,\" Anderson chided him, \"you're a little big to play outside linebacker.\"\nTruth be told, Turner was in fine shape. He just needed time to find his place on the defense, starting out on the bench until Drew Sanders suffered a season-ending injury five games into the 2021 season.\nBy that time, Anderson had already taken Turner under his wing, teaching him patience.\n\"From the get-go, it was an easy relationship to build,\" Anderson said. \"He came in with his head on right, he was willing to listen to the older guys in the room, and he just wanted to be great. And when you have guys like that, who share the mentality that I have, we just gravitate towards each other.\"\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nBy a shared mentality, Anderson meant, \"Whatever it takes to be great.\"\nLike Anderson, Turner came on late as a freshman, registering all 5.5 of his sacks in his final seven games.\nThe two became close -- \"That's my best friend, my little bro,\" Anderson said -- spending countless hours in the film room studying one another.\n\"It was never a competition between me and Will,\" Turner said. \"Because I always knew Will was good. I knew when I came in that people were going to be better than me. So I just tried to look at it as just be a sponge, just soak up everything.\"\nAnderson said Turner taught him a few things, too, like what techniques to use against certain offensive tackles.\nWhereas Anderson overwhelmed opponents with his strength and speed, Turner was a tactician. Their go-to moves even coincided with their nicknames: Anderson went by \"Speed-to-power Will\" while Turner went by \"Stab Club Dal.\"\nOffensive lineman JC Latham said he constantly has to be on the lookout for Turner's lethal \"ghost\" move, where he deploys a stutter step and curls under contact to get to the quarterback.\n\"Dallas has a pass-rush repertoire that allows him to dive deep into many different things,\" Latham said. \"So even though both [Turner and Anderson] are extremely talented, extremely great, they have two different types of styles to play.\"\nAnderson got all the publicity. He even picked up the catchy nickname, \"The Terminator,\" from then-offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian.\nTurner flew below the radar. \"It's just Dallas for now,\" he said.\nREPLACE WILL ANDERSON?\nAs in, replace an All-American and one of the best defensive players to ever come through Alabama?\nNo, Saban wasn't buying that premise at all.\n\"You don't kind of look at it like somebody's replacing somebody,\" he said. \"You look at it like, what do you need to continue to help develop that guy to play well.\"\nGopie has seen the long arc of Turner's development -- the five-star prospect with his pick of schools, the standout freshman at Alabama and the perceived sophomore dip last season, going from 8.5 sacks in 2021 to four sacks in 2022. Gopie said the numbers are a bit misleading because Turner was still affecting the quarterback as a sophomore. And the analytics back that up, showing a pressure rate of 12.2% vs. 13.8% the year before. Turner's third-down pressure rate actually improved 4.9 percentage points.\nBut Gopie recognized the pressure entering Turner's junior season. With Anderson no longer rushing off the opposite edge, it was fair to wonder how effective Turner would be.\n\"Last year when Will was projected a top-five pick, I think Dallas knew at that moment, 'OK, my time is coming and it's time for me to be able to lead the group,'\" Gopie said. \"He's no longer the young guy anymore.\"\nGopie said it has been encouraging to see Turner lean on his family and the pass-rush community he has been a part of during the offseason in South Florida, working with pros like Greg Russo, Shaq Lawson and Bradley Chubb.\n\"I think leaning on everybody that he has in his corner has really really empowered him to embrace this position,\" Gopie said. \"And he's excited for it.\"\nAt SEC media days this summer, Turner acknowledged what was at stake in what could be his final season in college. ESPN rates him a consensus top-10 pick in next year's NFL draft.\nA reporter reminded him that no Alabama player during the Saban era has gone three years without winning a national championship. But before the reporter could finish his sentence, Turner pointed to his ring finger, where a piece of jewelry should be.\nRemembering the losses the past two seasons and hearing all the criticism of the defense has been like adding fuel to their collective fire, Turner said.\nWhen Anderson said he \"cried [his] eyes out\" after Alabama suffered its second loss of the 2022 season at LSU, Turner said he was right there with him.\n\"But I feel like [Anderson] has taught me some things leadership wise to how to lead the team in the right direction,\" he said. \"But I feel like now we have all the right pieces now that we need all the right guys in the locker room, all the leaders that we need, too, to get to where we need to go.\"\nTurner promised he'd take \"full ownership.\"\nThat accountability showed after a Week 2 loss to Texas. Turner took it personally, calling it \"sickening\" that they gave up 34 points at home. The next day, the veterans on the team called a players-only meeting to clear the air. Turner called it a \"come-together moment\" in which they \"set the tone of what it's going to be on Saturdays.\"\nIn the three games since, Turner has been a man on fire, with 17 tackles, two forced fumbles and 5.5 sacks, which is second most among Power 5 players this season.\nDon't look now, but Turner's rate of sacks per game (1.1) and tackles for loss (1.5) are both higher than Anderson's last season.\nSo how good can he be?\nTaylor said there's no limit.\n\"As good as he wants,\" he said. \"He's an ultra-talented kid. Got a lot of bend, really good twitch, long, powerful. I mean, he's got everything. The length, the hand usage, plays a great pad level. He's as competitive as any kid I've been around. He's very gifted. Now the rest is up to him.\""}

Zach Edey and other elite big men decided against turning pro and returned for another year. Some of the top stars changed locations (see: Hunter Dickinson to Kansas). Coaches, too. Ed Cooley is at Georgetown now. Micah Shrewsberry is at Notre Dame.\nAll of that and we haven't even discussed the nearly 2,000 players who entered the transfer portal.\nThe change and volatility have made it even more difficult to project who will win conference player of the year honors in each of the 32 Division I men's leagues. But we'll give it a shot.\nSome of the candidates were easy to pick. (The Big South could probably give Drew Pember his second consecutive player of the year honor today if it wanted to.) Others were more difficult to identify.\nBut we're excited to see how it all plays out and how accurate we are at the end of the season.\nHere are our preseason predictions for player of the year in each league -- and the top competition they'll have to beat.\nJump to each conference:\nAmerican | America East |  ACC |  ASUN | A-10| Big 12 |  Big East |  Big Sky |  Big South |  Big Ten |  Big West |  CAA |  C-USA |  Horizon | Ivy | MAAC |  MAC |  MEAC |  MVC |  MW |  NEC |  OVC |  Pac-12 |  Patriot  |  SEC |  SoCon |  Southland |  SWAC |  Summit  |  Sun Belt |  WCC |  WAC\n \nAlijah Martin | 6-2 | G | Florida Atlantic Owls\nAfter averaging 15.2 PPG during FAU's run to the Final Four last season, Martin is back to lead the Owls in their first season in the AAC.\nTop competition: Jordan Brown, Memphis Tigers (19.3 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 1.2 BPG at Louisiana)\n \nClarence O. Daniels II | 6-foot-6 | F | New Hampshire Wildcats\nAlthough he had multiple suitors after entering the transfer portal this summer, Daniels (15.3 PPG, 10.7 RPG) decided to return to New Hampshire.

He could also help erase the memory of that first-round loss to Fairleigh Dickinson with a deep run in the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Terrence Shannon Jr., Illinois Fighting Illini (17.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG)\n \nAjay Mitchell | 6-4 | G | UC Santa Barbara Gauchos\nMitchell (16.3 PPG, 5.1 APG), who led the Gauchos to a conference tournament crown and NCAA tournament appearance last season, will chase his second consecutive Big West Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Elijah Pepper, UC Davis Aggies (22.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG)\n \nTyler Thomas | 6-3 | G | Hofstra Pride\nThe all-CAA second-teamer last season (16.5 PPG, 41% from 3) has one goal: to carry Hofstra to its first NCAA tournament appearance (the school won the CAA title in 2020 and would have played had the NCAA tournament not been canceled due to COVID-19) since 2001.\nTop competition: Charles Thompson, Towson Tigers (12.2 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 1.7 BPG)\n \nDontaie Allen | 6-6 | G | Western Kentucky Hilltoppers\nIn February and March, the former Kentucky guard began to hit his stride, seeing four games with 17 points or more. That momentum could propel Allen (9.3 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line) to new heights under new head coach Steve Lutz.\nTop competition: Kyle Rode, Liberty Flames (10.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line)\n \nBJ Freeman | 6-6 | G | Milwaukee Panthers\nFreeman showed his promise with a 43-point performance in a win over Stetson in last season's CBI. The guard, who averaged 18.22 PPG, could now help lead a program that's on an upward trajectory (22-12, 14-6 league) to its first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade.\nTop competition: Marques Warrick, Northern Kentucky Norse (18.8 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMatt Knowling | 6-5 | F | Yale Bulldogs\nThe all-Ivy League first-teamer (13.6 PPG) headlines a squad of key returners who were instrumental in winning the regular-season title.

But he was already a contender before they left, thanks to a sizzling February and March (20.4 PPG over the last nine games of the 2022-23 season).\nTop competition: Parker Bjorklund, St. Thomas-Minnesota Tommies (22.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG)\n \nAustin Crowley | 6-5 | G | Southern Miss Golden Eagles\nThe all-Sun Belt first-teamer returns to avenge a 4-for-13 performance in a first-round Sun Belt Conference tournament loss to South Alabama -- the same loss that sent the league's regular-season champs home much earlier than anticipated.\nTop competition: Donovan Gregory, Appalachian State Mountaineers (12.5 PPG, 4.3 APG)\n \nPJ Henry | 5-10 | G | Texas Southern Tigers\nFor the last three years, Texas Southern has won the SWAC tournament, and therefore the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.

With his return to college basketball, Harrison hopes to prove his 20-point effort in the Lopes' 82-70 loss to Gonzaga in the first round wasn't a fluke.\nTop competition: Cameron Tyson, Seattle U Redhawks (18.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG)\n \nAidan Mahaney | 6-3 | G | Saint Mary's Gaels\nWith Drew Timme gone, Mahaney (13.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line) could emerge as the face of West Coast Conference basketball -- particularly if he can lead the Gaels to another conference title (they shared the crown with Gonzaga last season) and an NCAA tournament berth.\nTop competition: Ryan Nembhard, Gonzaga Bulldogs (12.1 PPG, 4.8 APG at Creighton)"}
{"title": "All the biggest storylines of the 2023-24 offseason", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:23", "text": "Has it really only been six months?\nThe buzzer sounded on UConn's win over San Diego State in the men's college basketball national championship game exactly six months ago -- but the entire landscape of the sport has changed in that time. Rick Pitino is back in the big time; Bob Huggins is no longer coaching. Arizona will be headed to the Big 12; the Pac-12 is essentially no more. More than 1,800 players entered the transfer portal; another couple hundred turned pro.\nSimply put, there's been an incredible amount of change.\nBut before we turn the page and fully look ahead to the 2023-24 season, which tips off Nov. 6, let's take stock of exactly what happened in the past six months.\nIf the last thing you remember about college hoops is confetti falling from the NRG Stadium rafters after the Huskies won their fifth national championship in 25 years, ESPN's men's college basketball experts -- Jeff Borzello, John Gasaway, Joe Lunardi and Myron Medcalf -- are here to help you catch up.\nJump to:\nBiggest headlines | Coach & player movements | Bracketology risers and fallers | High school recruiting spotlights\n \nLeBron James says his son Bronny has begun his rehab process so he can play with USC this season.\nBronny James suffers cardiac incident\nDuring a July team workout at USC, the 5-star recruit and son of LeBron James collapsed after suffering cardiac arrest. James is recovering and attending his classes on campus. But his basketball future -- his father has said he hopes to one day play with Bronny in the NBA -- is unclear, per a recent statement from the university.\nHunter Dickinson picks Kansas\nIn May, the former Michigan star and top recruit in the transfer portal picked the Jayhawks over multiple suitors coveting the big man who averaged 18.5 points and 9.0 rebounds last season. In interviews, Dickinson implied his decision was partly influenced by name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities. His arrival likely elevates Kansas, which returns Dajuan Harris Jr. and K.J. Adams Jr., to the No. 1 spot in every reputable preseason poll.\nZach Edey, Donovan Clingan and Kyle Filipowski return\nThe current state of big men in college basketball is strong with three elite players returning for another season. Edey, the Purdue star who won the Wooden Award last season, is back to help a Purdue squad that suffered a historic upset against 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson in the 2023 NCAA tournament. Clingan, the 7-footer who averaged 1.8 blocks in just 13.1 minutes per game, will attempt to lead UConn to a second consecutive national title. And Filipowski, who is currently recovering from hip surgery, will try to lead Duke to its second Final Four appearance since 2015.\nControversy surrounds Rick Pitino hiring at St. John's\nIn three years at Iona, Pitino led the Gaels to two league titles and two NCAA tournament appearances. Pitino repeatedly stated he was content at the New Rochelle, New York, school and had no interest in other jobs. But he was eventually wooed by St. John's, which is just 30 minutes from his hometown of Oyster Bay, New York. The Hall of Fame coach has already made a massive impact in the transfer portal, adding Harvard star Chris Ledlum (18.8 PPG) and Penn's Jordan Dingle (23.4 PPG) along with other standouts who should immediately boost the Red Storm in the Big East race. But Mike Anderson, St. John's former head coach, has sued the school in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, claiming the school fired him for cause without justification.\nJahvon Quinerly picks Memphis Tigers\nLast season, the guard was critical to Alabama's NCAA tournament run, but he announced he would transfer to his third school when he committed to Penny Hardaway in July. As a grad transfer, Quinerly is immediately eligible for the squad that last season allowed former SMU transfer Kendric Davis to blossom. Quinerly, who averaged 8.7 PPG in Tuscaloosa last season, joins a nucleus that could include 27-year-old DeAndre Williams -- provided he is granted a waiver to play another season.\nChris \"Mad Dog\" Russo sounds off on the lack of rivalries between the teams heading to the Big Ten and Big 12 in 2024.\nBig 12 becomes superconference, rejects Gonzaga, UConn\nIn August, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark announced that talks with Gonzaga and UConn about joining the league ended after the conference decided to add four Pac-12 squads. While the Zags and Huskies would have strengthened men's basketball in a league that is arguably the nation's best, pound-for-pound, the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Utah and Colorado in 2024-25 also enhance the league. With Houston, BYU, Cincinnati and UCF all joining this season, the Big 12 will boast seven teams that finished 2022-23 within the top 30 on KenPom.\nMikey Williams' basketball career jeopardized by gun incident\nWith millions of followers on social media, the four-star recruit and Memphis commit was well-known even outside of basketball when he was in high school. But Williams' college hoops career is now on hold. Earlier this year, Williams was charged with six felonies after he allegedly fired a weapon at multiple individuals who had come to his San Diego home. He pled not guilty in the initial court hearing, but Memphis released a statement last week saying Williams will not be with the team until there is a resolution in his legal case.\nEd Cooley leaves Providence for Georgetown\nFor more than a decade, Cooley was the face of Providence basketball in his hometown. Under him, the Friars reached the NCAA tournament seven times. But his bond with the late John Thompson contributed to his shocking decision to accept the head coaching job at Georgetown. Providence officials and fans were blindsided by the move, which now gives Georgetown a proven leader as it attempts to rebuild the program following the turbulent Patrick Ewing era. -- Medcalf\n \nThe biggest movement of the summer was actually an exit. Bob Huggins entered the offseason No. 3 all time in career wins as a Division I men's coach, behind only Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim. Now, well, he's still No. 3, but that number for wins (935) will stay where it is until further notice.\nHuggins appeared to resign as West Virginia coach on June 17 after he was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. Then, in early July, he insisted he never formally resigned. Cue the lawyers. But Huggins is out, and Josh Eilert is interim head coach of the Mountaineers.\nNor should we look past a very different and truly historic offseason movement, one 65 years in the making. On June 8, the NCAA announced that all numbers from 0 to 99 will once again be permitted on men's college basketball jerseys. We haven't seen a 6, 7, 8 or 9 on the floor since Bill Russell rocked No. 6 for the San Francisco Dons in the 1950s.\nWho will be the first player to follow in George Mikan's footsteps with a No. 99 in hoops? The new season will literally look different than anything many of us have seen before. -- Gasaway\n \nRick Pitino chats on \"SportsCenter\" about why he decided to become the next coach at St. John's.\nIt's both embarrassing and instructive to look back at where we ranked teams at the start of the offseason versus now, with the tip off of a new season right around the corner. Alas, that is the assignment, and here are the results:\nBIGGEST RISER: St. John's Red Storm (No. 170 to No. 45, projected Last Four In). The Red Storm fired Mike Anderson on March 10 and needed only 10 days to lure Rick Pitino from New Rochelle (and Iona) to Queens. Myron covered the larger St. John's saga above, but suffice to say, Pitino's pursuit of an NCAA tournament bid -- and beyond -- for the Red Storm will be among the major storylines of the 2023-24 campaign.\nOTHER RISERS:\nIllinois Fighting Illini (No. 74 to No. 18, projected 5-seed). Illinois gained ground by essentially standing still, retaining 6-foot-6 senior Terrence Shannon Jr. and 6-10 junior Coleman Hawkins, a pair of standouts who figured to leave the program at the end of last season. Now, the Illini have the experience and production to challenge presumptive Big Ten favorites Purdue and Michigan State.\nMississippi State Bulldogs (No. 78 to No. 29, projected 8-seed). The Bulldogs already overachieved in Year 1 under Chris Jans, reaching the NCAA First Four. The surprising return of 6-2 senior Dashawn Davis, a presumed departure, means the trend line points even further up in Starkville.\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\nNorthwestern Wildcats (No. 76 to No. 32, projected 8-seed)\nOregon Ducks (No. 75 to No. 34, projected 9-seed)\nKansas State Wildcats (No. 70 to No. 41, projected First Four)\nVirginia Cavaliers (No. 72 to No. 43, projected First Four)\nStanford Cardinal (No. 77 to No. 49, projected First Four Out)\nNew Mexico Lobos (No. 95 to No. 50, projected Next Four Out)\nUtah Utes (No. 81 to No. 53)\nSeton Hall Pirates (No. 84 to No. 56)\nLSU Tigers (No. 96 to No. 64)\nNevada Wolf Pack (No. 121 to No. 68)\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nBIGGEST FALLER: Washington State Cougars (from No. 42, projected 11-seed, to No. 76). The Cougars' best players are now in Atlanta (Mouhamed Gueye, NBA Hawks), in Cleveland (Justin Powell, NBA Cavaliers), at Villanova (TJ Bamba, transfer portal) and at USC (DJ Rodman, transfer portal). The Cougars also don't have a conference after this season. Other than that ...\nOTHER FALLERS:\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish (from No. 183 to No. 214). The rebuilding Irish were always going to be a heavy lift for new coach Micah Shrewsberry. The loss of grad transfer Cormac Ryan to North Carolina makes the start of the post-Mike Brey era that much harder.\nMiami Hurricanes (from No. 10, projected 3-seed, to No. 33, projected 9-seed). Folks remain justifiably high on the Hurricanes, but it's hard not to forecast at least a one-season drop after a Final Four finish led by ACC player of the year Isaiah Wong, subsequently picked by the Indiana Pacers in the NBA draft.\nMORE FALLERS:\nUCLA Bruins (from No. 11, projected 3-seed, to No. 25, projected 7-seed)\nProvidence Friars (from No. 32, projected 8-seed, to No. 44, projected Last Four In)\nRutgers Scarlet Knights (from No. 35, projected 89-seed, to No. 47, projected First Four Out)\nOhio State Buckeyes (from No. 36, projected 9-seed, to No. 48, projected First Four Out)\nBoise State Broncos (from No. 38, projected 10-seed, to No. 52, projected Next Four Out)\nMichigan Wolverines (from No. 43, projected First Four, to No. 61)\nVirginia Tech Hokies (from No. 44, projected First Four, to No. 60)\n-- Lunardi\n \nCooper Flagg shows out with three nice dunks before playing in the SLAM Summer Classic.\nRon Holland decommits from Texas, goes pro\nHolland -- now the projected No. 1 pick in the 2024 NBA draft -- was expected to be the cornerstone of Texas' 2023-24 roster. He committed to the Longhorns in November and stayed committed, despite Chris Beard's firing. After weeks of speculation, however, the No. 2-ranked recruit in the 2024 class announced in late April he was reopening his recruitment. One month later, Holland chose to play for the G League Ignite.\nBronny James signs with USC\nJames' cardiac arrest was the biggest story of the summer, but his recruitment was one of the biggest stories of the spring. He became a legitimate five-star prospect and a projected first-round draft pick during his high school senior season then impressed at the postseason all-star games. There was very little concrete information about his recruitment, but USC emerged as the favorite over the final weeks and ultimately beat out Oregon and Ohio State.\nMackenzie Mgbako flips from Duke to Indiana\nOn the same day that Kyle Filipowski announced he was returning to Duke, Mgbako -- a top-10 recruit in the 2024 class -- requested a release from his letter of intent to the Blue Devils. He considered several schools following his decommitment, including Kansas, St. John's and Louisville, but picked Mike Woodson and Indiana, where he should immediately be a go-to scorer.\nCooper Flagg cements himself as the No. 1 recruit -- and reclassifies to 2024\nFlagg was the story of the summer in the recruiting world. Entering July, there was a debate over which player was the best in high school basketball: Flagg, Cameron Boozer or A.J. Dybantsa. A couple of weeks later, there was a clear winner. Flagg averaged 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 6.9 blocks at the prestigious Nike EYBL Peach Jam, including three triple-doubles. He then moved from the 2025 class into the 2024 class, and Flagg is in the process of taking his official visits. He went to UConn in late September, and he will head Duke this month. -- Borzello"}
{"title": "The offseason in five minutes: Everything you need to know", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "The 2022-23 season ended with the most-viewed women's college basketball game on record as the national championship returned to network television for the first time since 1995. Broadcast on ABC and ESPN2, 9.9 million viewers tuned in as LSU beat Iowa 102-85.\nWhat has happened since then? Glad you asked.\nWe head into 2023-24 with LSU ranked No. 1 in ESPN's Way-Too-Early Top 25. For the second straight offseason, coach Kim Mulkey cleaned up in the transfer portal to make the Tigers -- who have Final Four Most Outstanding Player Angel Reese back -- the favorites on the road to Cleveland, where the national semifinals and title game will be played April 5-7 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nDespite big personnel losses, led by WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston, South Carolina -- which spent all last season at No. 1 before losing in the Final Four -- will still be in the hunt. With Paige Bueckers, who missed last season because of an ACL injury, and Azzi Fudd, who was limited to 15 games by knee issues, back and healthy, UConn is another front-runner as the Huskies pursue a 12th national championship.\nBut while some things remain the same ... along comes conference realignment. Stanford seeks one more Pac-12 title before the conference as we know it dissolves. Stanford's next stop, incongruous as this is, is the ACC. UCLA, expected to be Stanford's biggest Pac-12 challenger, is headed to the Big Ten next season. But more on that in a minute.\nIowa senior Caitlin Clark, the NCAA tournament supernova and reigning national player of the year, is back -- maybe for more than this season. Clark's incoming freshman class of 2020-21 is the last that can use the COVID-19 waiver to return for a fifth year, so WNBA teams likely will have to wait until the end of the college season to find out exactly which players -- such as Bueckers, Clark, Reese and Stanford's Cameron Brink -- are in the draft pool and potential lottery picks.\nBut before we tip off the new season on Nov. 6, ESPN's Michael Voepel, Alexa Philippou and Charlie Creme look at what has gone on since LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy, and how it impacts the coming season.\n\nJump to:\nHeadlines | Key transfers, coaching news, recruits | Bracketology risers and fallers\nOn \"The Paul Finebaum Show,\" Carolyn Peck explains why the talented Gamecocks and a gritty Tennessee will be stiff competition for the reigning national champs.\nLSU gets even better\nThe transfer portal has been kind of like free agency in college, and more than 1,000 players entered the portal this past offseason. LSU bringing in Hailey Van Lith from Louisville and Aneesah Morrow from DePaul gave the Tigers the \"portal championship\" a year after they did the same with Reese from Maryland in summer 2022. More on the other biggest transfers below.\nUConn back to full strength?\nWhile UConn's absurd streak of 14 consecutive Final Four appearances came to an end, the Huskies seem due for better luck after two seasons of multiple injuries.\nBueckers was national player of the year as a freshman and then battled through injuries to get UConn to the NCAA championship game as a sophomore. The Huskies missed her last season, but she seems to have gone through rehab well, is cleared to play and is ready to regain her status as one of the college game's biggest stars.\nSo long, Pac-12\nWe should have seen it coming when UCLA and USC announced in summer 2022 that they were headed to the Big Ten. The Pac-12 was crumbling, with the walls officially tumbling in summer 2023. With four teams headed to the Big Ten, four to the Big 12, two to the ACC and two others with an uncertain future, the Pac-12's swan song in 2023-24 is an ode to how football and television revenue have rendered geographic ties in college almost irrelevant.\nWell-played, Big 12\nIn summer 2010, the Big 12 appeared on the verge of collapse. It survived with 10 teams, and now will be adding Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah next season, putting the league at 16 teams after Texas and Oklahoma depart for the SEC. From a women's hoops perspective, the league will miss the Longhorns and Sooners, but the Utes (No. 5 in ESPN rankings) and Buffaloes (No. 22) are having program resurgences. And Arizona is just a few years removed from its appearance in the 2021 NCAA final.\n\nKa-ching!\nThe college world has changed with Name, Image and Likeness opportunities, especially for the bigger stars in women's sports. Players such as Reese and Clark have spent time since the national championship game shooting television commercials and being paid for appearing at events. -- Voepel\nCheck out highlights from No. 1 recruit Lauren Betts as she announces her intention to transfer from Stanford.\nAny discussion of the biggest player and coach news this offseason must start with LSU. Not only did Mulkey get the two best players in the transfer portal, she signed the No. 1 recruiting class, including two -- Mikaylah Williams and Aalyah Del Rosario -- of the top seven players in the 2023 class. Then early last month, the four-time national championship coach got a 10-year, $36 million contract extension, making her the highest paid coach in women's basketball.\nOut west, meanwhile, Lauren Betts' decision to leave Stanford for UCLA could signal a power shift in the Pac-12. The 6-foot-7 center was the top recruit in 2022 (and No. 3 in our transfer rankings) and had a promising showing for Team USA at the AmeriCup.\nAside from LSU, a handful of SEC schools did everything they could to keep up in the transfer portal:\nTennessee, seeking its first Final Four since 2008, when the Lady Vols won their eighth title, added a new backcourt. Destinee Wells (Belmont) and Jewel Spear (Wake Forest) are two scoring guards, something the Lady Vols have lacked in recent years.\nOle Miss brought in three new starters, and coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin didn't even need that many. Fresh off their first Sweet 16 since 2007, the Rebels have Kennedy Todd-Williams (North Carolina), KK Deans (Florida) and Kharyssa Richardson (Auburn) on what is now a deep and versatile roster.\nJoni Taylor joins \"The Paul Finebaum Show\" and reflects on Texas A&M's expectations, while emphasizing the spirit of coaching among the best in the SEC.\nOutside the SEC, TCU underwent the biggest shake-up from the end of the regular season until now. Of the more than four dozen Division I coaching changes this offseason, Mark Campbell from Sacramento State to the Horned Frogs has had the biggest impact so far.\nAfter seven years as an assistant at Oregon in which he spearheaded the recruitment of Sabrina Ionescu, Ruthy Hebard and Satou Sabally, and then two seasons with Hornets, which included the program's only NCAA tournament appearance, Campbell has already reformed TCU without even coaching a game. He plucked Jaden Owens (Baylor), Madison Conner (Arizona), Agnes Emma-Nnopu (Stanford) and Sedona Prince (Oregon) out of the portal, significantly improving a roster that went 1-17 in the Big 12 a year ago. -- Creme\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nAfter South Carolina's Boston, Laeticia Amihere, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton were all selected in the 2023 WNBA draft, a changing of the guard is headed to Columbia this fall. Dawn Staley has plenty of reinforcements ready to take the mantle, such as center Kamilla Cardoso and point guard Raven Johnson, but she also brings in the nation's No. 2-ranked recruiting class and was active in the transfer portal, signing Te-Hina Paopao from Oregon as well as Sakima Walker, the 2023 NJCAA player of the year.\n\nIn the Pac-12, USC returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014 and will look for its first appearance in the Associated Press preseason poll since 2011. Now the legendary program adds No. 1 overall recruit Juju Watkins and several experienced players from the portal. It is unclear if/when Aaliyah Gayles will make her college debut after recovering from being shot 10 times at a party in April 2022, but social media indicates she has been practicing. -- Philippou\nHow different did our projections look between our April 18 update shortly after LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy to our latest field of 68 on Sept. 19? These were the biggest women's Bracketology movers.\nBiggest riser: TCU\nNR to No. 41/projected Last Four Byes\nAs mentioned above, Campbell has reshaped the Horned Frogs into a veteran, NCAA tournament-worthy team. Once he finished all his work in the transfer portal, TCU was a No. 11 seed in last month's projection.\nOther risers\nMississippi State: No. 37/projected Last Four Byes to No. 21/projected No. 6 seed\nAfter two wins in the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs upgraded their talent, too. Lauren Park-Lane (Seton Hall), Darrione Rogers (DePaul) and Erynn Barnum (Arkansas) will give the offense more punch. The Bulldogs were already a tournament team, but Sam Purcell pushed his Bulldogs more safely into the field.\nTexas A&M: No. 44/projected Last Four In to No. 28/projected No. 7 seed\nThe Aggies were too young a year ago and finished 9-20. So Joni Taylor made it a priority to bring in some experience. Graduate student Endyia Rogers (Oregon), senior Aicha Coulibaly (Auburn) and redshirt junior Lauren Ware (Arizona) give Taylor some veterans to put around ultra-talented sophomore Janiah Barker.\nBiggest faller: Arkansas\nFrom No. 26/projected No. 7 seed to No. 44/projected Last Four In\nWhen Barnum left the Razorbacks for Mississippi State, she helped elevate the Bulldogs and left Arkansas without a proven go-to scorer.\nOther fallers\nNC State: From No. 25/projected No. 7 seed to No. 33/projected No. 9 seed\nThe Wolfpack got passed by a few teams because of portal inactivity. After losing Jakia Brown-Turner to Maryland, NC State didn't add anyone of impact. -- Creme"}
{"title": "Who's the player of the year in all 32 women's college basketball conferences?", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "Caitlin Clark is the clear favorite for the 2023-24 women's college basketball national player of the year. The Iowa guard became a household name last season, winning every major postseason award for which she was eligible. She even transcended women's basketball by taking home the Sullivan Award, given to the year's best amateur athlete.\nBut despite being the preseason front-runner, Clark has plenty of competition.\nPaige Bueckers is back from a season lost to a knee injury, and the UConn guard won most of the national player of the year honors when she and Clark were freshmen in 2020-21. LSU's Angel Reese also returns after outdueling Clark for a national championship and the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player in April.\nCameron Brink of Stanford and Elizabeth Kitley of Virginia Tech are two post players who have both played in the Final Four and can dominate, just in a different fashion than Clark.\nAll these players will be among the favorites to win player of the year in their respective leagues. But they aren't the only ones. It's time to break down the prospective winners in all 32 conferences.\nSome are fifth- and sixth-year seniors looking for one more season of success. Others are young players about to make their mark, or transfers from big-name schools looking to renew their careers at mid-majors. All will have a chance to pick up some hardware at season's end.\nNavigate to each league:\nAmerican | America East |  ACC |  Atlantic Sun | A-10 | Big 12 |  Big East |  Big Sky |  Big South |  Big Ten |  Big West |  CAA |  C-USA |  Horizon | Ivy | MAAC |  MAC |  MEAC |  MVC |  MW |  NEC |  OVC |  Pac-12 |  Patriot  |  SEC |  SoCon |  Southland |  SWAC |  Summit  |  Sun Belt |  WCC |  WAC\n\n \nDanae McNeal, 6-0, G, East Carolina Pirates\nAfter being named AAC Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player and first-team all-conference, the big prize is about the only honor left for McNeal to win as she enters her fifth season. McNeal's scoring average jumped from 8.4 PPG to 17.4 PPG, which was good for second in the league. She also ranked eighth in the country with 97 steals for the AAC tournament champs.\nTop competition: Sammie Puisis, 6-1, G, South Florida Bulls\nThe Bulls' top returning scorer at 15.6 PPG, Puisis also led the AAC in 3-point shooting percentage (38.7%).\n \nAdrianna Smith, 6-0, F, Maine Black Bears\nWith teammate and 2022 conference POY Anne Simon sidelined for much of last season with injuries, Smith came out of nowhere to win the award in 2023. Smith jumped from 2.1 points and 2.0 rebounds per game as a freshman to a league-leading 18.0 PPG and 9.5 RPG last year. Her 23.5 PPG and 10.3 RPG in conference games marked the first time since 1994 that an America East player averaged over 20 points and 10 rebounds.\nTop competition: Emma Utterback, 5-8, G, Vermont Catamounts\nThe America East leader in assists, Utterback is a big reason why the Catamounts had their best season in 13 years.\n \nElizabeth Kitley, 6-4, C, Virginia Tech Hokies\nAstonishingly consistent over the past three seasons, Kitley is the reigning two-time conference player of the year. Adding the honor this year would mean joining Alana Beard and Alyssa Thomas as the only three-time winners. Kitley has averaged 18.1, 18.2 and 18.2 points and 10.4, 9.8 and 10.7 rebounds per game the past three seasons all while shooting between 53.1% and 55.8% from the field.\nTop competition: Olivia Miles, 5-10, G, Notre Dame Fighting Irish\nMuch of Miles' All-American potential and Notre Dame's fate this season hinges on her recovery from a knee injury suffered late last season. It doesn't appear she will start the season on the court, but when she gets to a 100%, Miles might be the best passing point guard in the country.\n \nAntwainette Walker, 5-11, G, Eastern Kentucky Colonels\nAfter one season at Little Rock and two more at Marquette, Walker settled into EKU, earning ASUN Newcomer of the Year and first-team all-conference. She led the league in scoring (21.0 PPG) and steals (2.4 SPG) and was second in rebounding (9.4 RPG).\nTop competition: Ajulu Thatha, 6-1, F, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles\nA grad transfer from SIU Edwardsville, Thatha earned all-OVC honors with 13.7 points and a league-leading 9.7 rebounds per game. She will play her fifth year with the Eagles, looking to be the best player on the A-SUN's best team.\n \nMaye Toure, 6-1, F, Rhode Island Rams\nA summer of international basketball a year ago for the France native propelled her from a little-used player on Rhode Island's bench to the Rams' best player. She led the A-10 regular-season co-champs in scoring (13.8 PPG) and rebounding (8.2 RPG). An outstanding athlete and tireless worker, Toure might be ready to be the conference's best player.\nTop competition: Kyla McMakin, 5-11, G, Saint Louis Billikens\nIn her four collegiate seasons (including three at Longwood), McMakin has never averaged fewer than 17.2 points per game. Her 27 points against UMass in the A-10 title game propelled the Billikens to their first conference tournament championship.\n \nPaige Bueckers, 5-11, G, UConn Huskies\nIt feels so long ago that Bueckers was the best player in college basketball, but it was only 2020-21 that she took home every national player of the year. Injuries cost her much of 2021-22 and all of last season. But she showed her ability to bounce back when her recovery two years ago led to Huskies run to the national championship game. That included a Bridgeport Regional MOP and a Final Four all-tournament selection for Bueckers. Completely healthy, Bueckers will be back in the running for national honors again.\nTop competition: Aaliyah Edwards, 6-3, F, UConn Huskies\nUConn guard Azzi Fudd could be thrown into the mix here as well, with the Huskies expected to dominate the Big East if they stay healthy. Edwards is the one UConn star who has been healthy throughout her career, and she blossomed last season as one of the best frontcourt players in the country. She led the Huskies with 16.6 points per game and the Big East with a 58.9 field goal percentage.\n \nJamie Loera, 5-9, G, Eastern Washington Eagles\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nAfter three seasons with minimal playing time at Arizona State, Loera joined the Eagles and became the Big Sky's Defensive Player of the Year (2.6 SPG). She also ranked third in the conference in assists (5.1 APG) and scored 11.4 points per game.\nTop competition: Carmen Gfeller, 6-1, F, Montana Lady Griz\nAn all-conference honoree in each of the last three seasons, Gfeller led the Lady Griz in scoring (14.2 PPG) and emerged as one of the Big Sky's best shooters.\n \nLauren Bevis, 5-5, G, High Point Panthers\nSecond in the POY voting last year with Gardner-Webb, Bevis brings 15.4 points per game and 40.9% 3-point shooting to the Panthers for her bonus season.\nTop competition: Christabel Ezumah, 6-2, F, Campbell Fighting Camels\nBlossoming as a junior, Ezumah was named first-team all-Big South while setting career highs with 10.3 PPG and 9.3 RPG.\n \nRori Harmon, 5-6, G, Texas Longhorns\nOne of the best defensive players in the country regardless of position, Harmon is the glue that kept the Longhorns together on their way to a share of the Big 12 regular-season title. Her 7.4 assists per game were a program record, and she and Caitlin Clark were the only players in the country last season to average over 11 points, seven assists and five rebounds.\nTop competition: Darianna Littlepage-Buggs, 6-1, F, Baylor Bears\nA potential breakout star as a sophomore, Littlepage-Buggs was one of the best freshmen in the country last season. She was a unanimous choice as the top rookie in the Big 12. With the Bears now fully separated from the Kim Mulkey era, Littlepage-Buggs might be the face of the program.\n \nCaitlin Clark, 6-0, G, Iowa Hawkeyes\nThe Big Ten has a host of good players, but Clark as Big Ten Player of the Year might be the easiest prediction of the 32. There is no more dynamic scorer in the game, and she has also led the country in assists two years running. Her shooting range is incomparable, and no player elicits more excitement. Clark's career averages of 27.2 points, 7.9 assists and 7.0 rebounds are staggering.\nTop competition: Mackenzie Holmes 6-3, F, Indiana Hoosiers\nIn most leagues, in most years, Holmes would be a heavy favorite to be a conference player of the year. Clark makes that nearly impossible in the Big Ten. Holmes, whose decision to stay for a fifth year keeps Indiana among the best teams in the country, was the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and a first-team All-American.\n \nLily Wahinekapu, 5-7, G, Hawaii Rainbow Wahine\nIn two seasons Wahinekapu has been the Big West Freshman of the Year at Cal State Fullerton and a first-team all-conference team selection at Hawaii. She led the Rainbow Wahine in points (12.9 PPG), assists (2.9 APG), steals (1.7 SPG), minutes (32.2 MPG), 3-point percentage (33.1%) and free throws.\nTop competition: Evanne Turner, 5-9, G, UC Davis Aggies\nThe Aggies' all-time leading 3-point shooter, Turner led the Big West in scoring last season at 15.1 PPG.\n \nKylie Kornegay-Lucas, 5-10, G, Towson Tigers\nAfter leaving Virginia, Kornegay-Lucas has been the CAA Sixth Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. Her offense was on display last season as well, leading the Tigers in scoring (14.0 PPG), rebounding (7.3 RPG) and assists (4.0 PPG).\nTop competition: Jada Logan, 5-9, G, Charleston Cougars\nIn her first season with the Cougars, Logan was second in the CAA in scoring (18.0 PPG) and recorded the second triple-double in program history.\n \nSavannah Wheeler, 5-6, G, Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders\nWheeler was the top scorer (15.1 PPG) on a Blue Raiders' team that set the CUSA record for most league wins (18). She also led the Blue Raiders in assists.\nTop competition: Destiny Salary, 6-0, G, Western Kentucky Lady Toppers\nA former four-star recruit, Salary played the last two seasons at Ole Miss and now has a great opportunity with the Lady Toppers.\n \nDestiny Leo, 5-10, G, Cleveland State Vikings\nPrimed to be one of the best players in Horizon League history, Leo will be attempting to defend her 2023 Player of the Year trophy. For the second straight season, Leo led the league in scoring (17.9 PPG) and was among the country's best free throw shooters (91.1%).\nTop competition: Brooke Quarles-Daniels, 5-7, G, Oakland Golden Grizzlies\nOne of the most decorated recruits in Oakland history, Quarles-Daniels was the Horizon's best freshman a year ago and led the Golden Grizzlies with 12.1 points and 3.1 assists per game.\n \nAbbey Hsu, 5-11, G, Columbia Lions\nOne of the most prolific shooters in the country, Hsu set the Ivy single-season record for 3-pointers and ranked second in the country with 3.3 treys made per game. Her 17.8 points per game led the league -- and she could be even better after spending the summer competing with Team USA at the AmeriCup in Mexico.\nTop competition: Kaitlyn Chen, 5-9 G, Princeton Tigers\nLast season's winner and the Ivy League tournament Most Outstanding Player each of the last two years, Chen remains the leader on the Ivy League's best team.\n \nAaliyah Parker, 5-9, G, Niagara Purple Eagles\nThe only underclassman on the all-MAC first-team, Parker led the conference is scoring (16.9 PPG) and ranked second in the country with 3.4 steals per game. That all helped the Purple Eagles to the postseason as a Division I program for the first time in their history.\nTop competition: Anajah Brown, 6-1, F, Siena Saints\nIf the Saints are to challenge for their first regular-season title since 2004, Brown, coming off a third-team all-MAAC season, will have to be one of the conference's best players.\n \nQuinesha Lockett, 5-10, G, Toledo Rockets\nWith one of the best three-year runs in program history, Lockett will be on every national mid-major player of the year list. She was voted the Mid-American's best player a year ago after averaging 17.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals per game.\nTop competition: Reagan Bass, 6-1, F, Akron Zips\nThe only underclassman to make the all-conference first team, Bass ranked in the top 10 in scoring (17.1 PPG), rebounding (7.7 RPG), field goal percentage (51.3%) and blocks (1.1 BPG).\n \nDiamond Johnson, 5-5, G, Norfolk State Spartans\nFew players in the MEAC have ever had the résumé of Johnson. After an all-Big Ten freshman team season at Rutgers, Johnson was the ACC's Sixth Player of the Year in 2022 and NC State's leading scorer (12.3 PPG) last season. Her presence makes the Spartans a heavy favorite for a third consecutive regular-season title.\nTop competition: Destiny Howell, 6-0, G, Howard Bison\nLast year's winner, Howell led the MEAC in scoring (16.8 PPG) and 3-point field goal percentage (35.6%).\n \nKatelyn Young, 6-1, F, Murray State Racers\nHad the Racers been more successful last season (8th place in the MVC), Young might be going for a POY three-peat. She won it in the OVC in 2022 and then led the MVC in scoring (20.1 PPG) and rebounding (8.1 RPG) a year ago. According to HerHoopStats' advance metrics, she was 12th in the country in offensive win shares.\nTop competition: Grace Boffeli, 6-1, F, Northern Iowa Panthers\nIf UNI is going to win its first MVC title since 2016, Boffeli will need to have a big year. Duplicating last year's 16.1 PPG, 9.2 RPG and 55.3% shooting from the field would qualify.\n \nDesi-Rae Young, 6-1, C, UNLV Lady Rebels\nYoung won MWC Player of the Year in 2022 and then had an even better season last year but lost out to Colorado State's McKenna Hofschild. The award is Young's to lose this time around. The Lady Rebels have been the dominant team in the MWC for consecutive seasons, and Young is a big reason why. Last year she led the league in rebounding (10.2 RPG) and was second in points per game (17.8) and field goal percentage (59.4%).\nTop competition: Allyson Fertig, 6-4, C, Wyoming Cowgirls\nThe two best players in the MWC might be centers, a rarity in the modern game, but it was Fertig (13.6 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 59.6 FG%) who elevated the Cowgirls to second place in the conference and a WNIT berth.\n \nNy'Ceara Pryor, 5-3, G, Sacred Heart Pioneers\nNo freshman dominated her league the way Pryor did in the NEC. She led the conference in scoring (17.7 PPG), assists (4.3 APG) and steals (3.7 SPG) and became the first in league history to win player of the year, freshman of the year and defensive player of the year in the same season.\nTop competition: Jayme DeCesare, 5-5, G, Merrimack Warriors\nMerrimack enjoyed its best season since moving to Division I in 2019-2020. DeCesare was a big part of it with 10.2 points and 3.5 rebounds per game and a first-team all-league nod.\n \nSharnecce Currie-Jelks, 6-2, F, UT Martin Skyhawks\nExpect the Skyhawks to be back near the top of the OVC like they were in 2020 and 2021 -- and expect Currie-Jelks to lead them. Last season's OVC Freshman of the Year was second in scoring (15.2 PPG), fifth in rebounding (6.9 RPG) and first in field goal percentage (53.9%).\nTop competition: Macy McGlone, 6-3, F, Eastern Illinois Panthers\nWith the graduation of Lariah Washington, expect even more opportunity for the Panthers' second-leading scorer and the OVC's top returning rebounder.\n \nCameron Brink, 6-4, F, Stanford Cardinal\nAs last season wore on it became clear that Brink was Stanford's best player. That will be the case from day one this year, when she will be the No. 1 option for the Cardinal every trip up the floor. She set career highs in points, rebounds and assists in 2022-23, but most notable were her 3.5 blocks per game. Those solidified her status as one of the best defensive players in the country.\nTop competition: Alissa Pili, 6-2, F, Utah Utes\nLast year's winner, Pili led the conference in scoring (20.7 PPG) and field goal percentage (59.0%). In her first year with the Utes after transferring from USC, Pili transformed the Utes into an elite program, earning their highest NCAA tournament seed ever (No. 2).\n \nLex Therien, 6-1, F, Loyola Maryland Greyhounds\nHer team's improvement from a 4-14 league mark might be necessary for Therien's candidacy, but she has done plenty on her own, averaging a double-double in each of her first two seasons.\nTop competition: Caitlin Weimar, 6-4, F, Boston University Terriers\nVoted the league's best defensive player last season, Weimar was also BU's leading scorer (15.5 PPG) and rebounder (10.0 RPG).\n \nRickea Jackson, 6-2, F, Tennessee Lady Vols\nDespite a four-year career in the SEC that has seen her average 17.4 points per game over time with both Mississippi State and the Lady Vols, Jackson hasn't received as much attention as some other conference stars. That might change this season. Her game grew more efficient in her first season in Knoxville. Jackson's 54.8 field goal percentage was a career best, and her 19.2 PPG ranked third in the conference.\nTop competition: Angel Reese, 6-3, F, LSU Tigers\nWith the arrivals of Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow to LSU, Reese's numbers that were so eye-popping a year ago (23.0 PPG, 15.4 RPG) might take a hit, but she still easily qualifies as one of the best players in the SEC and in the country.\n \nRachel Rose, 5-7, G, Wofford Terriers\nOn Rose's shoulders, the Terriers won their first conference championship in 2023. She led the team in nearly every offensive statistical category, and the conference coaches selected the sophomore as the player of the year. Another season like that and Rose will probably win over the media, too.\nTop competition: Raven Thompson, 5-10, F, Chattanooga Mocs\nThompson's 19-point, nine-rebound performance in the SoCon tournament title game prevented Wofford from reaching its first NCAA tournament. That earned her tournament Most Outstanding Player after she had already won SoCon Freshman of the Year.\n \nAlecia Westbrook, 6-1, F, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi Islanders\nLast season's winner, Westbrook has averaged a double-double and won the SLC's Defensive Player of the Year in consecutive years. As the Islanders' leading scorer and the league's leading rebounder, Westbrook helped Texas A&M-CC win its first conference championship in 2023 (shared with SE Louisiana).\nTop competition: Akasha Davis, 6-2, F, Lamar Cardinals\nDavis followed up a freshman of the year campaign by finishing second in the league in scoring (14.6 PPG) and rebounding (8.8 RPG) and first in field goal percentage (61.4%) as a sophomore.\n \nKacie Borowicz, 5-7, G, North Dakota Fighting Hawks\nThe Summit League's leading scorer each of the last two seasons, Borowicz decided to come back for her bonus year for a three-peat. Borowicz also topped the Summit in assists last season and has been one of the country's best free throw shooters in her four years in Grand Forks.\nTop competition: Hannah Cooper, 5-7, G, Oral Roberts Golden Eagles\nCooper went from 6.5 points per game in 2021-22 to 20.3 last year, good for second in the league to Borowicz. She topped the Summit in steals (2.5 SPG) and minutes (36.9 MPG).\n \nDomonique Davis, 5-6, G, Southern Miss Lady Eagles\nDespite a drop-off in her 3-point shooting, Davis set a career-high in scoring (17.2 PPG), helping the Lady Eagles to a three-way tie for first place, their first regular-season conference championship in 29 years.\nTop competition: Terren Ward, 5-11, G, Georgia Southern Eagles\nOne year after winning Sun Belt Sixth Player of the Year, Ward increased her scoring and rebounding, leading the conference at 18.4 points per game.\n \nTi'lan Boler, 6-1, G, Jackson State Lady Tigers\nThe most versatile player on the league's best team, Boler was especially good down the stretch, scoring in double figures in five of the season's final six games as the Lady Tigers won their third consecutive SWAC regular-season title.\nTop competition: Chanel Wilson, 5-7, F, Bethune-Cookman Wildcats\nAfter getting minimal playing time in two years at Indiana, Wilson transferred to Bethune-Cookman and was the SWAC Newcomer of the Year.\n \nTrinity San Antonio, 5-10, G, Grand Canyon Lopes\nSan Antonio's decision to transfer from Cal Baptist to Grand Canyon could shift the fate of the two programs fighting for a WAC title in 2023-24. San Antonio was a first-team all-WAC selection after filling the stat sheet with 14.1 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.7 APG and 2.3 SPG.\nTop competition: Breaunna Gillen, 5-9, G, Utah Tech Trailblazers\nGillen enters her fifth season in St. George as the Trailblazers' all-time assist leader. She was the league leader at 6.5 APG a year ago and finished second in scoring (17.8 PPG).\n \nYvonne Ejim, 6-1, F, Gonzaga Bulldogs\nBecoming a full-time starter for the first-time last season, Ejim led the defending regular-season champs in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, and was a finalist for the Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Kaylynne Truong, 5-8, G, Gonzaga Bulldogs\nEjim's biggest challengers are likely to come from her own team. Truong was last year's winner after scoring 15.8 points per game and leading the WCC with 5.0 assists per game."}
{"title": "Wood: Difficult to keep making weight, moving up after Warrington title defense", "date": "2023-10-05 16:31:25", "text": "Leigh Wood believes Saturday's world title defense could be his last as making the featherweight limit is becoming increasingly difficult for him.\nWood (27-3, 16 KOs), the WBA featherweight champion and ESPN's No. 2 at 126 pounds, defends his title against English rival Josh Warrington (31-2-1, 8 KOs) on Saturday at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, England.\nWood, 35, managed his weight perfectly for his last outing in May, which resulted in an impressive performance as he contained and outpointed the dangerous Mauricio Lara after flooring him early on. The Mexican went into the fight as ESPN's No. 1 at featherweight after stopping Wood in the seventh round of their first fight in February, but was stripped of the belt the day before for missing the weight.\n\"It gets harder every time to make the featherweight limit,\" Wood told ESPN. \"The last time against Lara was harder than before and Lara not making the weight made me feel even more sorry for myself. I know what it is like.\n\"I'm 35 now and I've been making this weight for a long time, it doesn't get easier. I think it takes a little bit out of me and I would be stronger at junior lightweight, definitely. There's nothing more I can cut, except if I was to cut an arm off.\"\nFor Wood, the climax of his career could be at junior lightweight even if he beats Leeds native Warrington. Both are two-time world champions in the last phase of their careers looking to set up a big fight for next year.\n\"I said two more fights after I beat Lara, but it's a fight-by-fight basis really,\" Wood said. \"I don't want to retire from boxing until I'm the first boxer to headline at the City Ground in Nottingham. The timing meant we couldn't do the Warrington fight there in the summer -- the ground had a new pitch laid [before the English Premier League season started in August] and even the Nottingham Forest players couldn't train on it.\"\nJoe Cordina (16-0, 9 KOs), the IBF junior lightweight champion, is a possibility for the winner of Saturday's fight in Sheffield, as like Wood and Warrington he is promoted by Matchroom. Cordina defends his belt against Edward Vazquez on Nov. 4 in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\"My focus is on Josh Warrington but I'm confident and if I did move up Joe Cordina is a possibility, he's a great fighter,\" Wood told ESPN. \"My dream is to fight at the City Ground, and I have to win this one to make it happen. It would have to be a unification fight or perhaps a rematch with Michael Conlan to keep me at featherweight.\"\nWood's career leapt from domestic to elite level when he knocked out Xu Can in the last round for the WBA world title in July 2021, before doing the same to Michael Conlan in 2022's ESPN fight of the year. Despite his strong recent performances, Wood is aware that Warrington represents a different challenge.\n\"My discipline and patience was what I was pleased most about against Lara,\" Wood told ESPN. \"I had to stay switched on when there was not a lot happening because he likes to jump in and surprise you. I learned that the hard way in the first fight with him. Patience was also key in the second fight, not to go leaving myself open.\nWoods believes he needs a different approach against Warrington because he's a different style of a fighter.\n\"There are things he does well but there are areas I know I can exploit against him,\" Wood said.\nWood insists the pressure is on Warrington this time after Warrington lost the IBF belt to Luis Alberto Lopez a year ago. Warrington, 32, was also stopped by Lara in 2021, broke his jaw in a hard-fought stoppage win over Kiko Martinez in 2022, and then lost a majority decision against to Lopez.\n\"There's a lot of pressure on Josh for this one, he knows it will be very hard to come back from another defeat,\" Wood said. \"He's not fought for a while and it favors me that I have momentum, I'm better when I'm active. This is my third fight inside eight months, activity has served me well through my career. I think Josh is boxing well, I don't think he's on the slide and he lost a close fight versus Lopez.\n\"There's a lot on the line for both of us.\"\nOn the undercard, Cecilia Braekhus -- once the biggest star in women's boxing -- gets a chance to revive her career at the age of 42.\nThe Colombia-born, Norway-based boxer challenges Terri Harper for the WBA and vacant WBO junior middleweight titles after suffering two losses in her last three fights.\nBraekhus (37-2, 9 KOs) lost back-to-back decisions to Jessica McCaskill for the undisputed welterweight championship in 2020 and 2021.\nBut Harper (14-1-1, 6 KOs), 26, from Doncaster not far from Sheffield, will be boosted by home support as well as her recent form and will be making a second WBA title defense.\nShe said: \"I've got to take away her jab and stay busy. I believe I can stop her.\""}
{"title": "Ross Chastain is too busy to trade barbs with NASCAR rivals", "date": "2023-10-05 17:37:36", "text": "HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. -- Ross Chastain is very comfortable at Waffle House.\nThat is where he is seated on a Tuesday morning, two days after finishing dead last at Talladega, which happened one week after finishing second at Texas, and only five days ahead of Sunday's NASCAR playoff 12-teams-to-eight cutoff event on the Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval, where he will start the race sitting three positions and nine points on the wrong side of that elimination line. So close, but so much work to do.\nYet here the three-time Cup Series racer winner is, the maestro behind the Hail Melon maneuver at Martinsville Speedway one year ago that became a crossover social media sensation, calmly knocking down coffee, over-easy eggs, grits and a peanut-butter-smeared waffle. He's in a bright yellow booth that is sandwiched directly between an off-duty landscaping crew and four vacationing husbands who have chosen to sit across the restaurant from their wives. No one in the place, not the patrons, not the java-pouring server, not even the batter-splattered cook at the griddle, has any idea that there is a race car driver in their midst.\nAnd not just any stock car racer but NASCAR's current lightning rod.\nThe guy who inspires as many boos as cheers. See: the seemingly 50/50 split of praise and ridicule that followed the Hail Melon (and a NASCAR rule change to prevent it from happening again), even after it cut through the NFL noise to put NASCAR on the media map and earned him a spot in 2022's Championship Four.\nThe guy whose name now comes up even when he isn't involved. See: a NASCAR on Fox Instagram post of Saturday's Truck Series fight between Matt Crafton and Nick Sanchez that produced nearly 900 comments. The top comment reads: \"I don't know how but it was Chastain's fault.\"\nThe guy who can't seem to get through a month without eliciting barb-covered sound bites about him from the sport's biggest stars.\nMartin Truex Jr. in August: \"Get your s--- together.\"\nKyle Busch, same day: \"I got Chastained.\"\nDenny Hamlin on his podcast after a wreck with Chastain in March: \"I think that Ross doesn't like it when I speak his name in the media and when I have this microphone. I told him I have a microphone and I'm going to call it like I see it. Until you get a microphone, you can then say whatever you want about me.\"\nSitting here in this Waffle House booth north of Charlotte, Ross Chastain is given that microphone. A chance to smother and cover the NASCAR world with a sharpened, witty response. Tape is rolling. The platform of the Worldwide Leader in Sports awaits.\nBut his reaction is the same now as it has been whenever he received similar \"Here's a flamethrower\" invitations from other outlets and shows. He shakes his head and smiles.\n\"I'm good, man. I've got too much work to do,\" the driver from Florida says to ESPN. \"I don't know what a response to anything said about me is going to do. It would be easy, sure. It would be easy to fire back on Twitter or go on a radio show or podcast and respond to stuff that's been said about me, and I am sure that it would get a big response. A lot of clicks and likes and dislikes and whatever. For a few hours, maybe a day. But the next day, you know what? I would still have the same work to do, and now I'd be a day behind because I spent it doing all of that stuff that doesn't matter. The work matters.\"\nHe smiles again.\n\"The best response is in results, and the only way to achieve results is through hard work.\"\nChastain knows hard work. In fact, he has arrived here for late breakfast having already put in a day's worth of it. There's body work, which he has just done for a couple of hours on the basketball court under the eye of a former college coach. There's racing work, having already conferred with Josh Wise, former NASCAR competitor and USAC champion, who is now a driver development and performance adviser with Team Chevy, walking racers through their physical and mental preparation before each race.\nBy week's end Chastain will have also been coached up by everyone from crew chief Phil Surgen to Olympic speed skating legend Dan Jansen, a longtime Charlotte-area resident, who helps the racer dive even further into his physical and mental shape. All the while he is ingesting all the data he can possibly process from throughout 2023 as well as last year's Roval event, where he finished 37th. That won't be good enough this time around.\n\"It's a lot, but it's all right here,\" he says, thumping the cover of ... a leather-bound notebook? \"I write everything down in here. I'm old-school like that.\"\nRoss Chastain is old-school all the time. That's why he still loves Waffle House.\n\"Waffle House, or sausage, egg and cheese biscuit in the truck, or even a Snickers bar and a soda in the truck. That's breakfast, man,\" he says as he busts the yolk from the white. \"I don't eat this as much as I used to, but I probably still eat it more than I should. I guarantee you my dad and brother still had one of those combos this morning on the way to work.\"\nThat would be down in Punta Gorda, where father Ralph and brother Chad, six years younger, still spend their days farming, managing thousands of acres in South Florida that produce more than 2,000 watermelons per acre. The work is grueling, hot and intense.\nWhen Ralph started putting Ross to work as a kid, the problem was never getting his son to work, it was getting him to slow down. Whenever Ross was behind the wheel of one of the sawed-off school buses used to transport the melons or a tractor rigged to plow or grade land, the kid had his foot in the throttle, seeking to beat whoever was doing the same job a few rows over.\nThe Chastains, eighth-generation watermelon farmers, worked six days a week. On the seventh day, they rested. Ross slowed down only to park in front of the television to watch his hero Jeff Gordon battle rivals on the racetrack, beginning with Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace and then on to the next-gen likes of Busch and Kevin Harvick.\n\"Every step of my ladder wasn't supposed to happen,\" he recalls now. \"When I was 12 and we started, we were just supposed to do some local racing in Florida and nothing else. Then we were like, 'You know what? Let's try the next level, just one race, just so we can say that we did it.' Then that turned into the next step and the next step and all along the way.\"\nThe watermelon industry, enamored with one of its own moving up the NASCAR ladder, started providing some financial help. That has been framed up by Chastain critics as a silver-spoon kid buying rides, but, spoiler alert, bringing sponsorship to help land gigs is the way of the motorsports world.\n\"There are plenty of guys with rich daddies backing up a truckload of cash that keeps the guy in that car even when he's clearly a total disaster,\" explained Stacy Compton, the former Cup Series racer and ESPN analyst, not long after giving Chastain his first ride in the NASCAR Truck Series in 2011, replacing just-departed Justin Marks. \"Then there are the guys who have just enough to get themselves into a car for a race or two and they know if they are bad, the money's going to run out, the ride is going back to the shop and they all disappear forever. That guy, the second guy, you are never going to outwork that guy because he is literally racing for his racing life.\"\nChastain has raced for his racing life for so long that he doesn't know how else to go about it. Since that debut for Compton on July 29, 2011, he has made 493 starts across NASCAR's three national series, and at one point he set the record for most consecutive starts in all of those series to start a single season. It took him 66 tries spread out over nine years to finally earn the first of his four Truck Series wins, 132 tries over five seasons to grab the first of his three Xfinity Series wins and 121 starts spread out over six years before he shocked the world with the first of his three Cup Series wins, on the road course in Austin, Texas, on March 27, 2022.\n\"What people don't see, and this isn't unique to me, but they don't see the fighting to make it, is that you spend your time between those races not working on racing,\" Chastain says, sitting up straight over his untouched toast. \"It's phone calls and sales calls and business meetings. That's what this notebook was full of then. And for every deal you get done, there are 10 times that many that don't. Or deals that do and then, for whatever reason, stuff beyond your control, they fall apart.\"\nThe Smash™️ pic.twitter.com/aBJ8e99Wgi\nHe says he felt an indescribable relief in 2021 when new boss Chip Ganassi told him to stop with all of that other stuff and just worry about racing. Then, at midseason, while at a test session, he learned that Ganassi had sold the team to Marks, the racer whose vacancy with Compton had given Chastain his big league break a decade earlier. Newly rebranded Trackhouse Racing was an unknown at best, and even after Chastain had been assured that he would still be with the team, switching from the No. 42 Chevy to the No. 1 in 2022, the arrival of NASCAR's one-size-fits-all Next Gen car was the biggest unknown of them all.\n\"When 2022 started, we knew we had a little bit of an edge and I could feel it as soon as we started unloading for practice at the racetrack every weekend,\" Chastain remembers now of the season when he won not once but twice, including the Hail Melon and his rise through the ranks, to the ire of those who characterized it as reckless. \"I remember feeling this super-intense feeling of, 'Man, you'd better take advantage of this now because you don't know how long this is going to last.' So, yeah, as a driver, I attacked. If there was an opening, I was driving it in there. I was driving like I had better do it now because one day it might all go away. And that's how I felt.\"\nIt's a feeling straight from the farm. Watermelons are harvested only 100 days per year. Anyone who doesn't figure out how to get all they can out of those 100 days will spend the other 265 sifting through the want ads.\n\"This year, as the other teams have caught up to us, you have to change the way you approach the day,\" Chastain says. \"When you don't have the fastest car every week, you can't be in attack mode all the time. You pick your spots. But when you are there, when the chance comes, you can't hesitate. If you do, someone else won't and it's gone.\"\nChastain has only recently been introduced to the term \"imposter syndrome,\" explained to him by his longtime girlfriend, Erika Anne Turner. The official definition, as written by the National Library of Medicine is \"a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills or accomplishments among high-achieving individuals.\" In other words, a fear of being exposed as a fraud, even among people whose accomplishments are many and indisputable.\nIn the NASCAR garage, a world full of rags-to-riches stories, it is a common refrain and feeling. Richard Childress, a high school dropout who has gone on to win six Cup Series titles as a team owner and made countless millions across multiple industries, speaks of recurring dreams that he is in his office when people rush in and begin taking everything away, telling him the jig is up and he has to go back to being homeless in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Childress says Dale Earnhardt confessed to having the same feelings.\nIt isn't a long psychological walk to understand that anyone who keeps that kind of feeling compartmentalized all the time would, like Chastain, employ every type of coach he can; take every ride he can every weekend, even if it doesn't pay; and spend his own money jetting to driving schools to drive Mazda Miatas around road courses, all in an effort to find the edge that will keep him not even up front but gainfully employed.\n\"I don't have any doubt that I should be here, but yes, there is always that feeling of not being here tomorrow,\" Chastain says in reaction to a discussion about Childress' and Earnhardt's fears. \"I absolutely catch myself looking around on Sundays and thinking, 'Man, I am out here racing with Kevin Harvick! And Denny Hamlin! And Kyle Busch!' I can't believe it. It's the dream, the dream I had as a kid, and you don't want to wake up from it.\"\nThat dream, the one conjured up by the kid racing roofless school buses full of watermelons through the fields of Punta Gorda, did not include being called out publicly by those same drivers, but that's the reality of life as the Melon Man. A student of NASCAR history, he also knows he is in good company. Harvick, Hamlin, Busch, Brad Keselowski and even Gordon, they all spent their formative Cup Series days having to race amid scoldings from their elders and contemporaries. In a way, it's the ultimate compliment, no matter how much it might hurt.\nSometimes, they even turn into actual compliments. Just last week, Hamlin said of Chastain's current NASCAR playoffs effort: \"The dude keeps making chicken salad out of chicken s---, most weeks. I mean, he does. Not saying his car is chicken s---, but where [Trackhouse] is at, he's optimizing his day 95% of the time.\"\nChastain knows it all. He reads it all. He is aware of when he has won over the legends and he is aware of when he has pissed them off. He also knows he is perfectly capable of defending himself. We all do. Just ask Noah Gragson.\nBut don't bother trying to bait him into doing so at the Huntersville Waffle House. There is too much to do.\n\"I can't race any harder or work any harder than I already do,\" he says, throwing his napkin like a syrup-stained surrender flag onto the table. Ross Chastain is officially looking ahead to Sunday, merely the latest chapter in a lifetime of racing do-or-dies. \"But I can race smarter. That work is never done.\""}
{"title": "USC at Michigan? Ohio State at Oregon? Big Ten's best matchups in 2024", "date": "2023-10-05 20:05:00", "text": "With the additions of Oregon, Washington, USC and UCLA, the Big Ten conference revealed its matchups for the 2024 to 2028 seasons on Thursday.\nThose matchups included 12 protected annual games, preserving rivalries and games of historical significance such as Ohio State-Michigan and the matchup of newcomers USC and UCLA.\nThere is a lot to digest with the matchups being released, and while we don't know exact dates and times, we do know which teams will face each other and how the future of the Big Ten will be shaped. Our writers analyzed the new Big Ten, breaking down the best games and the toughest and easiest matchups.\nJump to:\n2024 matchups\n\nTom VanHaaren: The 2024 schedule has a lot of really exciting matchups, but I think I'm most excited for USC traveling to Ann Arbor to play Michigan. We don't know yet if Caleb Williams will be the quarterback for the Trojans, but with Lincoln Riley as the head coach, we know the offense will be explosive. The Wolverines have put together a balanced team and have a defense that has stifled opponents this season. Putting USC's offense against Michigan's defense would be fun to watch.\nBlake Baumgartner: Ohio State's visit to Eugene to tangle with the Ducks is another great matchup. The two schools last met in Columbus back in 2021, with Oregon pulling off the upset of a top-10 Buckeyes team. Dan Lanning has been doing work on the recruiting trail and the race to succeed Bo Nix at quarterback will be fun to watch, as top-25 overall prospect Michael Van Buren (No. 23 overall in 2024) headlines a class that ESPN has ranked fourth. Kyle McCord has another year of eligibility for Ryan Day & Co. and will only be better following his experience in 2023.\nPaolo Uggetti: I'm with Tom and Blake, but for the sake of variety, how about Penn State traveling to USC in a rematch of the thrilling 2017 Rose Bowl? Sure, the players and some coaches are different now, but both offenses should be plenty explosive enough to provide a fitting encore. Really, any Big Ten team traveling to Los Angeles for a game against USC will make for an awesome environment not only because of the number of out-of-town fans who will make the trip, but also the transplants who already call the city their home.\nVanHaaren: Washington has a pretty tough schedule in 2024 with Iowa, Oregon, Penn State, Michigan, UCLA and USC all on tap. They'll have to travel to Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Penn State. That Penn State game on the road could be a tough one considering how hard it is to play at Beaver Stadium. The Huskies also will have to travel to Rutgers, which will be a hike across the country. Washington is at home against Michigan, Northwestern, UCLA and USC, but that is a lot to take on in one season considering the team will likely be breaking in a new quarterback after Michael Penix Jr.'s eligibility runs out.\nBaumgartner: Michigan has four games on its 2024 schedule that immediately pop off the page -- road dates with Washington and Ohio State to couple with games in Ann Arbor against USC and Oregon. Having to make only one trek out to the West Coast helps logistically. Much has been made about the quality (or lack thereof) of the Wolverines' nonconference slate the past few seasons. We knew that was likely to take care of itself with the addition of the four Pac-12 schools. But to finally see what that looks like on paper hammers home how difficult it will be to win a Big Ten crown, let alone back-to-back titles as the Wolverines have done the past two years.\nUggetti: Nebraska will have to go on the road to both Ohio State and USC in 2024. While the rest of their road games (Indiana, Iowa, Purdue) as well as their home games (Illinois, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin) don't present too tough a task, the two matchups against juggernauts on their home turf are enough to make their schedule next season one of the tougher ones in the conference. And given how they've looked so far this season, one can almost assume those two games will be near-automatic losses for the Cornhuskers.\nUggetti: In terms of big-name teams, I think Ohio State got the easiest draw in Year 1 of the new Big Ten. The Buckeyes travel to Northwestern, Michigan State, Penn State and will have to go to Oregon as their lone West Coast trip. They avoid playing USC, Washington and UCLA. That trip to Autzen will be much anticipated and, aside from perhaps the road trip to Penn State and hosting Michigan in the annual rivalry game, could be Ohio State's toughest task of the season.\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nVanHaaren: Rutgers has USC, UCLA and Washington, which will be a difficult stretch. But the Scarlet Knights don't have Michigan, Penn State or Ohio State on their schedule. That seems like a good trade-off, especially because the USC game is the only West Coast away game Rutgers will have in 2024. The matchups against Illinois, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington and Wisconsin will all be at home.\nBaumgartner: Logistically, Iowa's schedule stands out. Only once do the Hawkeyes have to travel out to the Pacific time zone -- for a game at the Rose Bowl with UCLA.

{"title": "Are United's making Hojlund's life harder by asking him to do the (near) unprecedented?", "date": "2023-10-05 20:18:19", "text": "Gab & Juls analyse Rasmus Hojlund's performance in Man United's 4-3 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. (1:04)\nAt the risk of piling on to the laundry list of Manchester United concerns -- back-to-back Champions League defeats, four defeats in seven games to open the Premier League season, no sign of the football Erik Ten Hag played at Ajax, Antony being questioned by police in two countries for assaulting women, Jadon Sancho exiled from the squad, Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martínez injured, the club being wholly or partly up for sale and nobody meeting the owners' expectations, Harry Maguire sticking around and the Glazers, too -- I wonder if it's time to fret over Rasmus Hojlund.\nIt has nothing to do with his attitude or his production thus far. Despite being injured going into the season, the young center-forward has looked, sharp, motivated and gifted. He scored a fine goal against Galatasaray and was among those least to blame for the home defeat.\nRather, I'm concerned about the enormity of the task in front of him: playing center-forward at his age on a team of United's magnitude at a time when all is not well and still living up to expectations.\nHojlund does not turn 21 until Feb. 4. He reportedly cost the club a whopping €70m ($73.5m) in transfer fees, rising to €80m ($84m) this past summer. To put this in context, according to Transfermarkt, only 42 players in the history of the game have changed clubs for bigger fees. Of those, just 11 were under the age of 21 and of those 11, none was a central striker, and none moved to a club facing the sort of turmoil currently engulfing United.\nIt's not just that Hojlund moved to an enormous club for enormous money at a very young age, either; it's that he will have to get serious playing time of the sort that center-forwards aren't usually afforded at his age. Why? Because United are in four competitions and they only have two other realistic options up front. One is Marcus Rashford, who is arguably their best player and has been far more productive playing out wide. The other is Anthony Martial, who has scored all of 11 goals in his last 67 league appearances. He also has a poor injury record and hasn't impressed in a long, long time, which explains why his contract expires in June and there has been no talk of extending it.\nAll this translates to a lot of minutes on the pitch for Hojlund, and that's not something we see very often at that age, especially at a major club with a lot of pressure.\nClubs are more willing these days than they were in the past to put their faith in youngsters, but when they do, it's overwhelmingly in certain positions: out on the wing, perhaps in attacking midfield, occasionally at fullback. These are roles where, rightly or wrongly, mistakes are easier to tolerate by fans, media and (crucially) teammates. Precocious center-forwards -- especially ones like Hojlund -- are not quite as rare as teenage keepers, but they're not far off either.\nTake the last five seasons in Europe's Big Five leagues and a cut off of, say, 60% of a team's minutes (2,052) as a reasonable amount for a starter. That's 118 teams multiplied by five seasons, which is 590 times it could have happened. Well, it only happened on 21 occasions and once you whittle down the players who split their between up front and out wide -- like João Félix in 2019-20 at Atletico Madrid, Christian Kouamé at Genoa in 2018-19 or Amine Gouiri at Nice in 2020-21 -- and stick to proper center-forwards, you're left with just 17 instances where this has happened.\nOf those, there are just two examples in the Premier League: Armando Broja at Southampton (2021-22), and Rashford at Manchester United (2018-19). And Rashford isn't a great comp here, since United often played a front two that season and unlike Hojlund, he'd been at the club from a young age and had 2½ years as a regular under his belt when he did it.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nElsewhere around Europe, you have Erling Haaland, who did it twice (no surprise there), but we're talking about a phenom and an outlier. With a few exceptions, most who did it were at small clubs with far less pressure, where it was OK to \"chuck in the kid\" and see what happened -- I'm thinking here of guys like Jonathan Burkardt at Mainz (2021-22) or Youssef En-Nesyri at Leganes (2018-19). The biggest clubs where it occurred were Real Sociedad (Alexander Isak, 2020-21), Fiorentina (Dusan Vlahovic, 2020-21), Eintracht Frankfurt (Luka Jovic, 2018-19, though he often played in a front two with Sebastian Haller) and Lille (Victor Osimhen in 2019-20 and Jonathan David in 2020-21, though, again both often played in a front two).\nYou might also notice that none of those guys -- except for Osimhen in 2019-20 -- played Champions League football and that three of them played in empty stadiums during the pandemic, rather than in front of 70,000 at Old Trafford.\nRob Dawson reacts to loud boos at Old Trafford after Erik ten Hag's decision to sub Anthony Martial on for Rasmus Hojlund.\nThe bottom line? United appear to be asking Hojlund to do something that's near unprecedented in Europe's major leagues. The fact that Haaland did it, he's also from Scandinavia and there's a certain assonance to their names is pretty meaningless here. Using him as a benchmark is also unfair. We know United's budget was stretched to the limit this past summer, but with hindsight, you wonder if maybe they wouldn't have been better off picking up a veteran striker, ideally on loan, to take some of the workload off Hojlund and help him develop.\n(OK, this is where some will giggle and blurt out: \"What? You mean like Wout Weghorst?\" Laugh all you like about Weghorst, but he cost nothing in fees, gave United some meaningful minutes and they finished third in the Premier League, won the League Cup and went on a deep Europa League run with him.)\nHeck, Hojlund himself benefited from being part of an attacking corps rather than the main man last season at Atalanta, when he scored 10 goals in 34 appearances. He shared playing time with two veteran center-forwards like Luis Muriel and Duván Zapata and only made 20 starts, very rarely up front on his own. And he was the team's third-leading scorer, after Ademola Lookman and Teun Koopmeiners. There was no European football to worry about, and the focus was squarely on his personal growth.\nHojlund has impressive tools -- we can debate the transfer fee another time -- and it's entirely possible that a season of apparent hardship and turmoil at the club will only toughen him up even further and not impact his development arc one bit. But the frustrating thing is that it didn't need to be this way. There was no reason to make his job that much more difficult and the club's massive investment in him that much more difficult to come to fruition."}
{"title": "WNBA trendsetters: Why Hammon, Brondello are just the start of former players as Finals coaches", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:47", "text": "When the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty tip off the WNBA Finals on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App), the coaching matchup between Becky Hammon and Sandy Brondello will be 26 years in the making.\nAlthough former WNBA players have coached teams to the Finals before, this is the first time in league history two of them will square off against each other in the championship series.\nAlong with Coach of the Year Stephanie White, whose Connecticut Sun lost to Brondello's Liberty in the semifinals, the success Brondello and Hammon are enjoying coaching the WNBA's highest-profile teams is reflective of the league embracing former players as coaches. After never  having more than three head-coaching spots held by former players, they've made up half of the league's 12 jobs in each of the past two seasons.\nWith the WNBA's diversity coaching initiative dramatically increasing the number of assistant coaches with playing experience in the league, Brondello and Hammon might be the first former players to square off in the Finals. They won't be the last.\n\"Since 2019,\" WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said, \"we have tripled the number of former players who are head coaches and significantly increased those in the assistant coaching ranks.\"\nBRONDELLO AND HAMMON -- who have both already won WNBA titles as coaches, Brondello with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and Hammon last season with Las Vegas -- previously saw their careers overlap in San Antonio. Brondello was an assistant during Hammon's first three years with the Silver Stars, and then her head coach in 2010. The same person brought both of them to San Antonio: longtime WNBA head coach Dan Hughes, an advocate for former players on the sidelines.\nStarting with his first full-time coaching job in 2000 with the Cleveland Rockers, Hughes had a former WNBA player on every one of his staffs.\n\"I knew I wanted to be a basketball coach, but I also knew that I wanted my staffs to be diverse,\" Hughes told ESPN. \"I wanted them to be different than me. That was always important to me. So I needed somebody who came in as a player and then became a coach. I always needed that. I needed that kind of mentality as part of the brain trust that I was trying to create to make good decisions.\"\nWhen Hughes joined the Silver Stars in 2005 after the Rockers folded, he received a cold call from Brondello while driving to scout a UConn-Notre Dame matchup. She informed Hughes she was retiring after a lengthy playing career in both her native Australia and the WNBA, and wanted to become a coach. Although Hughes had no prior relationship with Brondello besides coaching against her, he immediately saw her as the right fit.\n\"I did everything but hire her that moment,\" Hughes recalled. \"It was just perfect. That's exactly what I wanted ...\n\"Just the way she played the game and thought the game, I thought she would make a great coach.\"\nWith Hammon, a consummate leader during her 16-season WNBA career, the question for Hughes was never whether she could coach but whether she would choose to do so rather than pursue a career in media or outside basketball.\nIn 2013, Hammon suffered an ACL tear in her first game and spent the remainder of the season watching from the sidelines. She told Hughes at season's end she wanted to coach and asked whether he could help connect her with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and the coach who would go on to be the winningest in league history.\n\"I went over the next day to Gregg Popovich,\" Hughes said. \"They were in the gym, him and [Spurs CEO] R.C. Buford. I said, 'How do you feel about Becky coming over?' 'Oh, we'd love to have her.' Pop said, 'Give her my phone number and give me a call.' That's kind of how that went down.\"\nAfter spending the 2013-14 season shadowing the Spurs coaching staff while rehabilitating her injury, Hammon was hired by the Spurs in 2014 as the first full-time, paid female assistant coach in the NBA upon her retirement from playing.\nHammon's journey led back to the WNBA before last season. After interviewing for NBA head-coaching jobs, Hammon chose to leave the San Antonio bench to become head coach of the Aces, who won the 2022 title and are now looking to become the first repeat WNBA champion since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002.\nSitting on the bench alongside Brondello, Hughes remembers feeling what he calls an \"unspoken understanding of the game\" shared with Hammon on the court.\n\"Becky and Sandy both have incredible offensive minds,\" Hughes said. \"I like putting people like that around me, to be honest with you, because I come at it defensively. That's my starting point. Players, a lot of times, are like that. There were times -- and Becky wouldn't necessarily have been privy to some of these, because she was on the floor -- Sandy would interpret what Becky was going to do to me on the bench before Becky did it.\"\nBecky Hammon's Las Vegas Aces and Sandy Brondello's New York Liberty dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, the teams ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nHughes, who retired from the WNBA in 2021 ranked fifth all time in coaching wins, texted with both coaches after they advanced to the Finals. He's hoping to attend Game 3 in New York, but will be torn, knowing how both coaches might feel at series' end.\n\"Mostly I'm excited for both these coaches,\" Hughes said, \"but I know the reality that one of them is going to attain an incredible moment and another one is going to have a pretty incredible loss.\"\nINEVITABLY, THE WNBA needed time to build up enough longevity for former players to go into the coaching ranks. Though a pair of superstar players retired and were immediately made head coaches in the league's early days -- with Nancy Lieberman taking over the expansion Detroit Shock in the WNBA's second season (1998) and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke coaching the Phoenix Mercury in 2001 after winning Finals MVP in each of the league's first four years -- they were outliers.\nIt wasn't until 2009, the WNBA's 13th year of existence, that former players coached against each other in a regular-season game when Jenny Boucek's Sacramento Monarchs faced Jennifer Gillom's Minnesota Lynx.\nWhen WNBA teams sought professional playing experience in the league's first decade, they often turned instead to former NBA players. Five of the league's 13 coaches to start the 2004 campaign were NBA veterans after Bill Laimbeer's Detroit Shock beat Michael Cooper's Los Angeles Sparks in the 2003 Finals.\nAs the WNBA has matured, more players, like Brondello and Hammon, have had opportunities to play full careers before moving to the sidelines, first as assistants (Hammon getting that experience in the NBA) and later as head coaches. In 2015, Brondello and White were joined by Boucek to give the WNBA a record three former players on the sidelines.\nBy 2020, however, that trend seemed to be heading the wrong direction. After Katie Smith was fired by New York, Brondello was left as the league's only former player serving as head coach. At that point, as the NBA was also seeing decreasing numbers of head coaches with playing experience, the WNBA made a subtle but important rules change.\nAs reported in March 2020 by Erica Ayala at The Athletic, the league increased the limit on assistant coaches from two to three for teams that have at least one former WNBA player as either an assistant or head coach.\nBecause teams would prefer to have larger coaching staffs, they quickly responded by hiring more former WNBA players. In 2019, seven of the league's 12 teams had a former player on staff. By 2021, that was 11 of 12, and this year, for the first time, every team has one. The total number of assistant coaches with playing experience has skyrocketed from nine in 2019 to 22 this season.\n\"This is about a pipeline of your future leaders so that the next time we have a coaching role or a general manager role or a team president role, that you have a very diverse pool to pick from,\" Engelbert said in 2021. \"So that's what our diversity initiatives are working on -- building experience, building capability so the next person up will get a job when there's an opening. You have to do that sometimes three years before the opening comes for that person to be ready now.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nWhen Hughes retired, former player Noelle Quinn was elevated to replace him with the Seattle Storm. Starting with her promotion, hiring former players as head coaches became a trend. All four coaching vacancies after the 2021 season went to players with WNBA experience. Three -- Brondello, Hammon and Vanessa Nygaard with the Phoenix Mercury -- either played or coached for Hughes.\n\"I wanted the landscape, like it is now, to be reflective of former players,\" he said. \"Women who are sitting in that head-coaching position. That was important to me.\"\nIt's also notable that, after Derek Fisher was fired by the Sparks in June 2022, this was the first season since 1998 in which no former NBA player served as a WNBA head coach.\nAs compared to the NBA, the WNBA is a little behind schedule for having two former players meet as coaches in the Finals. That first happened in what the NBA considers its 20th season of existence, 1967, when Alex Hannum's Philadelphia 76ers beat Bill Sharman's San Francisco Warriors. We're also still nowhere near the peak of former players as head coaches in the NBA, which came when 22 of 27 (81.5%) to start the 1993-94 season had playing experience.\nHaving Brondello and Hammon lead their talented teams to the Finals is sure to create more opportunities for the increasing number of assistant coaches like them who have followed a typical path from playing to coaching.\n\"I think what we're starting to see,\" recently retired WNBA star Sue Bird said when Quinn was introduced as head coach in 2021, \"is the WNBA was almost too young 15 years ago to have these players with these long, successful careers where they've played in the WNBA, they've played for multiple coaches, they've played overseas, maybe they've had national team experiences, whatever the case may be. With that is just a ball of knowledge and a wealth of experience.\n\"And now we're finally starting to see those coaches become assistant coaches, become head coaches. That's the path that we've all kind of been waiting for someone to start to forge that path and now we're starting to see it. [Quinn's] just another example of that. I think it's amazing. I think we're going to see more of it. I have zero doubt about that.\""}
{"title": "Predictions: Can Aces repeat or will Liberty win first title?", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:47", "text": "Seven of 18 WNBA Finals have gone the distance since the best-of-five format started in 2005. With the top two seeds and preseason favorites playing for the 2023 WNBA championship, will we see an eighth rendition of a winner-take-all Game 5 when the Las Vegas Aces face the New York Liberty?\nWe couldn't ask for a better setup, with a matchup of superstars in their primes -- Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson and New York's Breanna Stewart -- as two teams with the top talent and what appears to be the best chemistry meet. The Finals will begin Sunday in Las Vegas at 3 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN App.\nThe most recent five-game WNBA Finals was in 2019, when the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun. That was a matchup of the top two teams in the standings, as was the case in 2016 and 2017, when the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx went the distance and alternated in taking home the trophy.\nThis season, the Liberty beat the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup final, while the teams split their four regular-season meetings. They played four times in August, so those games are still fresh in their minds.\nAlmost anywhere you look in this series, you'll see a No. 1 pick or an MVP or a statistical leader -- or someone who is all three.\nBoth coaches are former WNBA players; Las Vegas' Becky Hammon led the Aces to the league title last year, while New York's Sandy Brondello guided the Phoenix Mercury to the 2014 championship.\nThe fan bases come at this from a different perspective. The Aces' franchise dates to the start of the WNBA in 1997 as the Utah Starzz, but their time in Las Vegas has been short and successful. They moved from San Antonio to the Strip in 2018, and they are appearing in the Finals for the third time.\nNew York, on the other hand, is the only still-existing original WNBA franchise that has not won a title. While the Liberty players -- none of whom has been with the team since before 2019 -- might not really feel that historical weight, the longtime Liberty fans do.\nSo which superteam will be the 2023 champion? ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel preview the Finals.\nVoepel: Stewart's shooting woes have been a surprise. She was at 46.5% overall and 35.5% from behind the arc in the regular season. In the Liberty's six playoff games, those percentages have dropped to 35.6 and 20.7. Of course, if she got a lot of her misses out of the way before the Finals, that's good news for the Liberty.\nPhilippou: Having covered the Liberty-Sun series in person, New York seemed to develop grit in real time to overcome a 0-1 deficit versus an uber-tough Connecticut squad and win three straight games, including two at Mohegan Sun Arena. Different people stepped up in different moments for the Liberty, but for the most part, they stayed poised to close out such a competitive series in four games.\nI am surprised the Liberty's bench hasn't seen more minutes in the playoffs, since their depth seemed to be an advantage when considering New York as a contender earlier this season. Does that change against the Aces? Kayla Thornton's toughness and energy can turn around a game, as can Marine Johannes' shooting, and Stefanie Dolson adds post depth against a team that doesn't have a ton of it. Johannes had a stellar outing versus the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup championship, but she has played only 42 minutes this postseason.\nPelton: In addition to seconding what Alexa said, I agree Stewart's postseason slump has been a surprise. When the Seattle Storm lost to Las Vegas in last year's semifinals, it was the first time a healthy Stewart had been knocked out of the playoffs since 2017. And even then, Stewart set a playoff record with 42 points in the final game of a hard-fought series. Going back to UConn, and including EuroLeague competition, Stewart has almost always been at her best when the stakes are the highest. They don't come much higher than in this series.\nPhilippou: Yes, the Finals are a whole new series, but those games -- particularly the August ones -- showed us a lot about how these teams match up. That said, I expect Wilson to play closer to how she did Aug. 28 against the Liberty (23 points) than say how she fared Aug. 6, when she tallied nine points on 2-for-14 shooting and tweeted, \"I doubt I'll ever shoot 2-14 again I pray I don't lol.\" Since then, she has shot below 40% just once, and she has been playing on another level over the past two months or so. The Liberty have excellent defenders in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, but they'll still have their hands full trying to slow down Wilson.\nVoepel: The Aces' 98-81 victory over the Liberty on June 29 doesn't have much bearing on this series, as Candace Parker was still playing for the Aces, and Jones wasn't quite in the playing form she is now. The other four matchups, all in August, are likely indicative of what we will see in the Finals. The Aces didn't play well in their first game in Brooklyn nor in the Commissioner's Cup final in Las Vegas. Those will be games the Aces will review in preparation because they were far from their best in both.\nThe Aces and Liberty split their regular-season series, but New York beat Las Vegas in their Aug. 15 Commissioner's Cup championship game, which doesn't count toward WNBA standings or statistics. While the Aces are 2-3 against New York, they went 37-4 against the rest of the league, and only the Liberty had multiple wins against Las Vegas, per ESPN Stats & Information.\nPelton: It's interesting that head-to-head results haven't been particularly predictive of Finals results. Since the WNBA went to a single playoff table in 2016, and not including the shortened 2020 Wubble season, teams that won the regular-season series have gone just 2-4 in the Finals. And both of those winners, the 2018 Storm and last year's Aces, also had home-court advantage in the Finals. However, we've never seen teams play each other this often before the Finals. All of those previous head-to-head series were three games rather than the five times Las Vegas and New York have already met this year.\nPelton: Given the firepower on both sides, I think it's more about which team can consistently get stops. New York was 15-0 in the regular season (and 1-0 so far in the playoffs) when holding opponents to 95 points per 100 possessions or fewer. One of those games was the Aug. 6 blowout win over Las Vegas that represented the Aces' worst offensive performance of the season in terms of points per possession -- and the Liberty's best on defense.\nPhilippou: Defensively, for the reasons Pelton stated, but also because if you ask both Hammon and Brondello, they'd say defense wins championships. Not just by the pure nature of getting stops and keeping an opponent off the scoreboard, but for these two teams in particular, defense (and defensive rebounding) fuels offense on the other end, especially in transition.\nThe Aces have had the best defensive rating in both the regular season and playoffs, but they allowed the Liberty to score at least 80 points in all of their previous meetings except one -- Aug. 17, the only time Las Vegas beat New York in their four matchups that month.\nTop-seeded Las Vegas and No. 2 seed New York dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, they ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nVoepel: The Aces have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Wilson, but she has given much praise to Kiah Stokes as the true anchor of Las Vegas' defense. The Aces' Jackie Young is one of the league's best defensive guards and at 6 feet tall actually can take on just about anyone. Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark is also a versatile defender.\nIt makes sense to say defense will prevail in this series, for all the reasons Alexa and Kevin point out. Still, let's add this: The Aces can be like a runaway train on offense, and that can take over games. The Aces won playoff games scoring 97 points and 64 points, which shows how effective they can be on both ends of the court.\nPhilippou: Jones' emergence into her MVP-level self is arguably the single biggest development that has catapulted this Liberty team into a contender. In the postseason, she has had six double-doubles in as many games; and in the second half alone of Game 4 in the semifinals, Jones came up with 20 points and eight rebounds.\nGoing up against the Mystics' and Sun's frontcourts is different than facing that of the Aces' (especially with Wilson being unstoppable as of late). But if Jones can play like she did in New York's August meetings versus Las Vegas, the Liberty are much better positioned to win.\nAnother X factor is Liberty forward Betnijah Laney, who has scored at least 19 points in all but one of New York's postseason games and will be critical to helping contain the Aces' high-powered guards.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nVoepel: Jones is the biggest X factor overall in the series. The biggest for Las Vegas is Kelsey Plum's 3-point shooting, because that can really fuel the Aces. Plum averaged 2.4 3s per game and shot 38.9% from behind the arc in the regular season; during the Aces' five playoff games, she was at 3.2 and 42.1%. Plum, Young and Chelsea Gray all can do damage from long range, but if Plum gets in a groove, it makes Las Vegas' offense all the harder to stop.\nPelton: Stokes. Over the course of the season, as well as the playoffs, the Aces' starting lineup with Stokes in place of the injured Parker -- the group that led Las Vegas to last year's title -- has remained dominant.\nHowever, that hasn't been the case against the Liberty. In 45 minutes across the five meetings, the Aces were outscored by 19 points with their starting five on the court. Although Hammon can always go small with Clark in Stokes' place, not being able to keep Stokes on the court will leave Las Vegas painfully thin.\nPhilippou: Liberty in 5. I went back and forth and wouldn't be shocked to be proved wrong. But at the end of the day, it's hard to ignore how much the Liberty dominated the Aces in their most recent meetings in August. Plus, New York had a much tougher road to the championship series, and being battle-tested will pay off. Jones won MVP of the Commissioner's Cup championship game thanks to her dominance in the paint on both ends and on the glass, and I project her to take home Finals MVP should the Liberty win.\nVoepel: Aces in 5. This feels like the 2016 and 2017 Lynx-Sparks Finals, when there was such a good case for both teams to win both years. They split, with the Sparks winning in 2016 and the Lynx in 2017. The Sparks won 2016's Game 5 on Minnesota's home court, which is so hard to do in the clinching game of a playoff series. Then the Lynx won in Minneapolis in 2017's Game 5 -- although at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena, because Target Center was being refurbished. The WNBA's most recent Finals Game 5 was in 2019, when Washington beat Connecticut on the Mystics' home court.\nIt seems like this year, the Aces -- who celebrated their 2022 title in Connecticut -- might win it at home.\nPelton: Liberty in 4. That's not a reflection on how close the series might be, but lower-seeded teams that have won the Finals in the best-of-five era have been more likely to close out at home than win a Game 5 on the road. If Parker were healthy, I'd be inclined to pick Las Vegas. But New York has been the (slightly) better team since the All-Star break, and I don't expect Stewart's shooting slump to carry over into the Finals.\nRamona Shelburne: Aces in 5. Las Vegas misses Parker, and this matchup is going to be difficult. But the Aces are the defending champs until someone takes the title from them.

(1:38)\nIf you were asked in August to pick five teams that would be undefeated at this point, you'd probably be quick to name the traditional powerhouses: Georgia, Ohio State, Michigan, USC, Alabama. And you'd be wrong on Alabama. But you get the point.\nWho in the world thought Louisville, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and Washington State all would be unbeaten now? Sure, maybe one or two because of the early-season schedule. But not all the wins were expected -- who thought Kentucky would wallop Florida?\nThose teams put their perfect records on the line in Week 6, which features the biggest battle of 5-0 teams with No. 12 Oklahoma facing No. 3 Texas in Saturday's Red River Rivalry.\nOur reporters preview Week 6 with a look at the surprising undefeated teams and quarterback matchups to watch, plus some of the week's best quotes.\nLouisville: When Louisville hired native son Jeff Brohm, you could feel the excitement build not only among the fan base but among the football program. He then overhauled the roster and brought in several key transfers who have paid off in big ways, starting with quarterback Jack Plummer, who played for him at Purdue. Plummer ranks No. 3 in the ACC in passing, no surprise considering Brohm's background and history, and transfer Jamari Thrash ranks No. 2 in the league in receiving. Perhaps the biggest revelation has been the Cardinals' rushing offense behind Jawhar Jordan, who leads the league with 510 yards and six touchdowns. Defensively, transfers Devin Neal (Baylor) and Cam'Ron Kelly (UNC), tied for second on the team with 24 tackles, have been big additions, too. But returner Ashton Gillotte has taken the next step with five sacks.\nBrohm described his team's 13-10 win over NC State last week as his defense's best performance of the season. But it will take a complete team effort to beat Notre Dame and end the Irish's 30-game regular-season winning streak against the ACC.\n\"We've done just enough to win five games,\" Brohm told ESPN. \"And we've shown some toughness and some grit to come back and win a few, so that's been really good to see, our guys play that hard. To this point, everything's been good. I know as a coach that our schedule will just continue to get tougher and tougher, and we're going to have challenges ahead, starting this week.\" -- Andrea Adelson\nMaryland: Winners of its first five games in a season for the first time since Ralph Friedgen coached the program to the ACC title in 2001, Maryland heads into a major spotlight Saturday when it visits the Horseshoe to tangle with No. 4 Ohio State. Taulia Tagovailoa spearheads a Terrapins offense that leads the Big Ten in total offense (454.8 YPG) while sitting behind only Penn State in scoring offense (38.6 PPG). Tagovailoa, who tops the conference with both 1,464 passing yards and 13 touchdown passes, has three games of at least three touchdown tosses, led by last week's 352-yard, five-touchdown effort in a 44-17 dispatching of Indiana. Led by Jeshaun Jones' 19 receptions, six receivers have caught at least 11 passes and eight players have found the end zone, as Tagovailoa has done a stellar job of spreading the wealth and not letting opposing defenses key on one player. Defensively, Brian Williams' unit has forced 10 turnovers combined over the past three weeks in convincing victories over Virginia, Michigan State and Indiana. It faces its stiffest challenge yet with a Buckeyes offense itching to sustain momentum from their win in South Bend on Sept. 23. -- Blake Baumgartner\nKentucky: The schedule has been more than manageable, and even the most blue-hearted Kentucky fan would acknowledge as much. Three of the Wildcats' wins have come over teams (Ball State, Akron and Vanderbilt) with a combined 4-12 record, and a fourth win came over FCS foe Eastern Kentucky. That's not to diminish the fact the Wildcats are doing the things it takes to win at a high level, in particular running the ball, stopping the run, eliminating explosive plays and forcing turnovers. They're averaging 6.48 yards per rush (second nationally) and limiting opponents to 2.54 yards per rush (eighth nationally). Ray Davis, a transfer from Vanderbilt, rushed for 280 yards last week in the 33-14 win over Florida, the most rushing yards by an FBS player this season. Kentucky dominated the line of scrimmage, as quarterback Devin Leary attempted just 19 passes, completing nine for 69 yards. He's a better passer than he's shown to this point and will have to make more plays down the field in the passing game if the Wildcats are going to keep it going, and that starts Saturday against No. 1 Georgia. Leary's top two receiving targets, Tayvion Robinson and Barion Brown, left the Florida game in the second half with injuries. Their status is up in the air. Some younger receivers may need to step up, but the Wildcats are going to need more out of their passing game as they tackle an October stretch that includes Georgia on the road and then Missouri and Tennessee at home. -- Chris Low\nMissouri: The short version for why Mizzou is 5-0 is simple: Brady Cook to Luther Burden III. But here's the longer version. The Tigers began the season with wins over South Dakota and MTSU, but the offense disappointed terribly in the process. The Tigers averaged 4.9 yards per play against MTSU, worse than Murray State (5.7) and everyone else on the Blue Raiders' schedule, and a couple of fourth-and-short punts both revealed Eliah Drinkwitz's general lack of confidence and nearly proved costly in the 23-19 win. But the frustration emanating from that evidently lit a fire. The Tigers scored at least 30 points in wins over Kansas State, Memphis and Vanderbilt -- all teams better than MTSU -- in recent weeks. And Cook has been one of the best QBs in the country in the process, averaging 364 passing yards per game with eight TDs. He's set an SEC record for consecutive passes without an interception, and he's thriving both because of Burden, the nation's leading receiver, and because other targets like Theo Wease (118 yards vs. Vanderbilt) have begun to thrive. The Tigers' defense is still a top-30 or so unit, and suddenly the offense is dynamite. And now they return home to host an LSU team that is equal parts dangerous and flawed. -- Bill Connelly\nWashington State: With half the Pac-12 ranked in the top 18 of the AP poll, the Cougars remain under the radar despite climbing from unranked to No. 13. Yet, when laying out the best wins by Pac-12 teams, it's the Cougars -- Wisconsin, Oregon State -- who stand out. Both of those win margins were by single digits, but WSU controlled both games and has impressed on both sides of the ball. There is a lot of credit to spread around, but it begins with quarterback Cam Ward. In new offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle's offense, Ward has made significant strides to become one of the best quarterbacks in the country. He's accurate, he makes good decisions, and he's playing with a general sense of calm that evaded him at times last year. Plus, the additions of Josh Kelly and Kyle Williams at receiver have given him a deep, talent group of receivers, joining Lincoln Victor. This is a team without a major problem area, which makes it a tough out each week. -- Kyle Bonagura\n\nSam Hartman (Notre Dame) vs. Jack Plummer (Louisville)\nIt might be easy to pick Plummer based on what happened last season alone. Hartman, playing for Wake Forest, had the worst game of his career at Louisville -- throwing three interceptions, losing three fumbles and taking seven sacks in a 48-21 loss. He was benched to start the fourth quarter in a game Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson called a \"disaster.\" But Hartman is in a different spot now with the Irish -- and a different offense that is not asking him to put as much on his shoulders as he did at Wake. His late-game heroics last week against Duke led Notre Dame to a 21-14 comeback victory. Meanwhile, Plummer faced all sorts of pressure from the NC State defense a week ago and did not play his best game, throwing two interceptions and getting sacked four times. Expect Notre Dame to bring the same type of pressure as NC State did, and Hartman to have a much better performance than a year ago. -- Adelson\n\nQuinn Ewers (Texas) vs. Dillon Gabriel (Oklahoma)\nGabriel notably missed this game last year due to a concussion, leading to disaster for Oklahoma. Five different players attempted a pass, including two running backs and a punter, as the Sooners managed just 39 passing yards in a historic 49-0 blowout loss, the worst in any game in school history. But this season, he's leading the Big 12 in QBR, with Ewers second. Gabriel is third nationally with eight completions of 40 or more yards, while Ewers has been inconsistent on deep balls, though he's improved in that area. Both defenses have taken huge steps this season, but Gabriel has been more consistent and will be asked to do more. In what could end up as another Texas-OU shootout, Gabriel likely will have the better numbers. -- Dave Wilson\n\nTaulia Tagovailoa (Maryland) vs. Kyle McCord (Ohio State) \nMcCord finished the Notre Dame game on an encouraging note, but Tagovailoa had five touchdown passes last week and eight in his first two Big Ten games. Maryland's receiving corps doesn't generate the attention Ohio State's does, but there's real depth with Tai Felton and West Virginia transfer Kaden Prather emerging alongside Jeshaun Jones. \"Very similar to when I was at Alabama, I had [Henry] Ruggs and [Jerry] Jeudy] and [Jaylen] Waddle and Smitty [DeVonta Smith],\" Terrapins coach Mike Locksley told me. \"Your offense is more dynamic when the ball is spread around.\" -- Adam Rittenberg\n\nDevin Leary (Kentucky) vs. Carson Beck (Georgia)\nLeary, who passed for 6,807 yards during his career at NC State, is due for a breakout game. He's thrown 10 touchdown passes and five interceptions in his first five outings for Kentucky, which really hasn't needed to throw the ball much. The Wildcats could be short-handed at receiver with Tayvion Robinson and Barion Brown both being banged up, and that won't help matters against a Georgia defense that has already intercepted eight passes and is tied for third nationally in allowing just 4.8 yards per pass attempt. Carson Beck, in his first season as Georgia's starter, is completing 72 percent of his passes and averaging right at 300 passing yards per game. The Bulldogs got star tight end Brock Bowers going in the win over Auburn last week, and that's a connection that gives Beck (and any quarterback) the edge. -- Low\nBilly Napier: The Florida coach was blunt when it came to assessing his team's 33-14 drubbing by Kentucky.\n\"There is no sugarcoating this thing. We have no excuse. We can coach better and we can play better. Hopefully, we will do that.\"\nDeion Sanders: There's no question that celebrity has surrounded the Buffaloes, and the coach was more than happy to help Snoop Dogg deliver a message to Omarion Miller, who caught seven passes for 196 yards in Colorado's Week 5 loss to USC.\n\"A dear friend called me and summoned me to get him on the phone to FaceTime. [He] wanted to talk to him and wanted to let him know that he has a tremendous gift. I don't know what the conversation was, but I know I just handed him the phone. I said, 'Somebody wants to talk to you.' He looked at the phone like, 'Oh my god.' Yeah, it was Snoop. Snoop wanted to talk to [Miller]. He wanted to challenge him.\"\nDave Clawson: The Wake Forest coach, whose team plays at Clemson on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ET, ACC Network), hasn't forgotten last year's 2OT loss to the Tigers.\n\"There are certain games in your career you never, ever get over. That's one of them. When I'm on my deathbed, that game will still bother me. Hopefully, our players feel the same way.\""}
{"title": "Gio Reyna's USMNT return raises questions for Gregg Berhalter -- on and off the field", "date": "2023-10-05 23:47:12", "text": "The rapprochement between U.S. men's national team manager Gregg Berhalter and talented attacker Gio Reyna has finally taken place.\nNow what?\nReyna is included in the latest U.S. roster, which was announced on Thursday for games against Germany on Oct. 14 and Ghana three days later. The matches will mark Reyna's first action with the USMNT since fracturing his right leg in the Concacaf Nations League final against Canada last June.\nMore critically, Reyna and Berhalter will be working together for the first time since the 2022 World Cup, when tensions between the pair led to the families of both men being engulfed by a very public feud.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nThere are still plenty of questions about what the future holds for Reyna at international level. Foremost among these is the extent to which Reyna and Berhalter's relationship is really mended.\nThere was a roughly eight-month period in which the two didn't talk following a maelstrom of incidents that stemmed from Reyna's limited playing time at the 2022 World Cup. Berhalter afterward contributed to the subsequent outing of Reyna's poor attitude, and in response Reyna's family told U.S. Soccer officials about a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter.\nSuffice it to say, there was considerable healing that needed to take place.\nOn a conference call with reporters after Thursday's roster announcement, Berhalter confirmed that the first step took place \"weeks ago\" with the two conversing over a Zoom call. He didn't provide much in the way of details beyond that, except for saying that he and Reyna are in a \"good spot\" and that it was a \"positive conversation.\"\nBerhalter did acknowledge that the process of mending the relationship is ongoing.\n\"I think it will take time,\" Berhalter said. \"It is a difference between a Zoom call and being in person. But I think that both intentions are positive, and the idea is that we work together for the team to be successful, and I think we're both prepared to do that.\"\nTime will reveal the extent to which that actually happens. There are ups and downs in any coach-player relationship, and what took place over those eight months isn't just going to wash away.\nBut the two have to begin somewhere, and the upcoming camp is the place to start. Reyna's return to the national team camp raises its own set of on-field questions, though.\nReyna hasn't played for club or country since sustaining the aforementioned right leg fracture. He has been healthy enough to be on the bench for Borussia Dortmund of late, so how much could he see the field for the U.S. team?\nBerhalter indicated his approach to using Reyna in the upcoming games will be similar to his handling of Folarin Balogun during the September window. On that occasion, with Balogun working his way back to full fitness following his move to AS Monaco, Berhalter limited the forward to 45-minute stints against Uzbekistan and Oman.\nHerc Gomez reacts to U.S. soccer sporting director Matt Crocker saying there's \"a way forward\" for Gio Reyna and Gregg Berhalter.\nBerhalter said on Thursday that his goal is to build up Reyna's fitness \"in a safe way\" and send him back to Dortmund in a position to make a greater impact for his club.\n\"We're going to be creative with the minutes,\" Berhalter said in relation to Reyna. \"We want to certainly get him on the field and work through both the Germany game, and seeing what position he plays. And then in the Ghana game, same thing, seeing how we can get him in different positions throughout the camp on the field.\"\nWhere Reyna is deployed may just be the biggest question of all. During the 2022 cycle, Reyna played almost exclusively on the wing. But against better teams, the U.S. has struggled to create chances on a consistent basis and, in response, Berhalter could look at putting the creative Reyna in a position to get on the ball more.\nAt the 2022 World Cup -- in which Reyna played a mere 52 minutes due in part to disciplinary issues -- the USMNT's xG, or expected goals, per 90 minutes of actual playing time (which includes stoppage time) was 0.91. That xG, which measures chance creation, ranked 22nd in the tournament among all 32 teams, and 12th out of the 16 teams that reached the knockout stages. Yes, that's a small sample size, but it still points to how the U.S. could use more creativity.\nOne possible solution was on display last June, when the USMNT, under interim manager B.J. Callaghan, trotted out a 4-2-3-1 with Reyna in a central attacking role. Against World Cup qualifiers Mexico and Canada, the U.S. attack looked much more fluid and the attack also benefited from Reyna handling set piece duties.\nHerculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nBerhalter didn't rule out Reyna reprising that central attacking role, but he didn't completely commit to it either.\n\"In terms of Gio, we see him being able to play three positions: center midfielder, attacking midfielder and winger,\" Berhalter said. \"And we use wingers in different ways. Sometimes the wingers are wide against the line, and sometimes they're in between the lines, and we see him as more of an in-between-the-lines winger.\"\nThe continued absence of defensive midfielder Tyler Adams due to a hamstring injury means the U.S. manager has some other questions about his midfield to solve. Does he play with a single holding midfielder or resort to a double pivot? But in the past, Berhalter has lauded how the midfield trio of Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie played together, hinting that he would continue with that group if all were healthy.\nDuring the Nations League, Callaghan noted that Reyna's ability to defend is an area where the U.S. coaching staff have asked for improvement, and the 20-year-old responded well to that challenge. If that continues to be the case, the benefits of playing Reyna centrally seem to outweigh his defensive shortcomings, especially if he has two out of Musah, McKennie and (hopefully) Adams playing behind him. It seems the time has arrived to gather more data about Reyna's ability to operate in that midfield role.\nEither way, the games against Germany and Ghana will certainly provide a stern test to see if the U.S. attack -- as well as Berhalter and Reyna -- can move forward."}

(1:17)\nThe summer transfer window has closed throughout most of Europe, but there are still moves in the works and plenty of gossip swirling around. Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!\nLionel Messi could make a sensational return to Barcelona in the January transfer window, if Inter Miami don't make the Eastern Conference playoffs.\nThat's according to Spanish outlet AS, which has suggested that the 36-year-old World Cup-winner could head back to Spotify Camp Nou in January on loan for a proper send-off at the club where he spent 17 years.\nMessi has been keen to return to Camp Nou since his departure to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. Before his move to Inter Miami, Messi admitted he had been in discussions with his former club in Spain, but financial restrictions made a move too complicated.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nInter Miami are currently seven spots adrift of playoffs line in the standings with only three matches left, though they have at least one game in hand over the teams they need to leapfrog up the table. The MLS regular season ends on Oct. 21, at which point Messi's season would be over if Miami miss playoffs.\nMoreover, Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas even hinted that he wouldn't stand in the Argentine World Cup winner's way if there was a possibility Messi could seal his dream return to Spain.\nThe Argentine skipper is contracted to Miami until 2025 but he has already stated he has no interest in extending his stay in the MLS beyond that date, per reports. Messi has also recently been linked with a move to his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys when his stay in the U.S. ends.\n- Manchester City hope to fend off interest from Real Madrid in star striker Erling Haaland by holding contract talks soon, according to The Telegraph. Haaland has scored eight goals in 10 games this season after scoring 52 last time around, which is why City are hoping to extend his contract. Reports of Real Madrid's interest in the 23-year-old have been persistent, but it won't be an easy sell -- he is playing for the current European champions and is in excellent form. Los Blancos were hoping to sign one of Kylian Mbappé or Haaland in 2024, and for now neither move seems likely.\n- Newcastle United are preparing to battle it out with Liverpool and Juventus for Nice midfielder Khephren Thuram, according to Tuttomercatoweb. The 22-year-old central midfielder has been in sensational form for the fourth-place side and number of top clubs take interest. Thuram is contracted to the club until 2025 but could be available for around €40 million. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund are also interested.\n- Juventus continue to scour the market for rising stars, and the latest name linked with the Italian club is Shakhtar Donetsk's Georgiy Sudakov, per Tuttosport. The Bianconeri have been monitoring the 21-year-old midfielder for the last two seasons, and believe he has the attacking capabilities to offer them something different. Sudakov is seen as a possible target for the January transfer window, and Juve scouts went to Belgium to watch him in Champions League action against Royal Antwerp on Wednesday, where he starred in the No. 10 role in a 3-2 victory.\n- Michael Kayode has seized his opportunity at Fiorentina this season following an cruciate ligament injury to teammate Dodô, attracting the interest of Arsenal, according to Calciomercato. The 19-year-old, who three years ago was playing in Serie D, has impressed on the right flank, and his efforts have prompted Fiorentina officials to try and extend his contract beyond its current end date in 2025. Arsenal have been monitoring his progress since first watching him at the U-19 European Championship, in which he scored the winning goal in the final.\n- Nico Williams has been a man in demand since the summer, but he could disappoint any potential suitors by extending his contract at current club Athletic Club Bilbao, per Sport. Both Real Madrid and Barcelona are reportedly on the verge of conceding defeat in their pursuit of the 21-year-old winger. Williams' current deal is set to finish at the end of this season, but Bilbao are confident he'll extend his contract before the end of the year."}
{"title": "What to know about the Warriors' WNBA expansion franchise", "date": "2023-10-06 00:46:22", "text": "Ramona Shelburne and Malika Andrews react to the Bay Area receiving a WNBA expansion team. (1:05)\nWNBA fans have long clamored for expansion, and that day is finally here: The league will add a 13th team in the Bay Area, awarded to the NBA's Golden State Warriors, that will begin play in 2025, the WNBA announced Thursday.\nA second expansion franchise is expected to be announced this year, likely Portland, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. That franchise would also begin play in 2025. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert confirmed in a news conference Thursday the league's goal is to have 14 teams by 2025.\nEngelbert and Warriors personnel declined to reveal the expansion fee the Warriors paid. Engelbert added only that it was \"a record-breaking expansion fee\" for the league, along with other significant investments that come with starting a WNBA franchise.\nThe league, which had as many as 16 teams in 2000, has held steady at 12 teams since 2010, after the Sacramento Monarchs folded the previous year. It last had 14 teams in 2008, when both the Monarchs and Houston Comets were still playing.\nThe long-awaited news of expansion won't just open up more roster spots -- which currently is at a maximum of 144, or 12 per team -- but will also reestablish the WNBA in at least one market where the league has already been: The Monarchs were an original franchise and played in Sacramento from 1997 to 2009, winning a championship in 2005. The Portland Fire were added in 2000 before the franchise folded in 2002.\nThe new team -- which will likely be called \"Golden State\" per Shelburne, though its official name and mascot are still to be determined -- will play home games at the Chase Center in San Francisco (where the Warriors play) and will practice in Oakland at the Warriors' former practice facility.\nThe Warriors are the sixth NBA franchise with a WNBA team, joining the Indiana Pacers (Indiana Fever), Minnesota Timberwolves (Minnesota Lynx), Brooklyn Nets (New York Liberty), Phoenix Suns (Phoenix Mercury) and Washington Wizards (Washington Mystics).\nGolden State also expands the league's footprint out West, giving the WNBA five teams in the Pacific or Mountain time zones.\nESPN's Alexa Philippou, Michael Voepel and Kevin Pelton break down what we know and what we are still waiting to find out about the new Golden State WNBA team and the league's expansion plans.\nWarriors personnel and Engelbert pointed to signs that women's basketball and women's sports in general are taking off. On Thursday they mentioned how viewership, attendance and merchandise sales are all going in the right direction, as well as increased sponsorship interest even within the past five to 10 years. To put it simply: \"The league is ready,\" said Joe Lacob, Warrior co-executive chairman and CEO.\nWhile the WNBA sat on expansion for over a decade, the NWSL (which began competition in 2013) has showcased the surging interest and investment in women's sports, as the league has expanded from eight to 12 teams since 2021 and has three more to come, including one in the Bay Area.\nThe inability of promising yet developing players, or even already established talented veterans, to maintain roster spots in the league has led to calls for the WNBA to expand its size, which could be done either via franchise expansion or by increasing the number of players teams are permitted to carry. WNBA stakeholders have different opinions on which route would be best, but Engelbert has maintained she believes franchise expansion is the way to go.\n\"The depth of the talent in this league has never been better, and the depth of the talent and breadth of the talent coming out of the NCAA system has never been better,\" Engelbert said Thursday.\nFranchise expansion will arrive amid enormous excitement over the crop of talent and high-profile players currently in college -- a group Engelbert called \"generational players\" Thursday -- with the likes of Iowa's Caitlin Clark, LSU's Angel Reese, Stanford's Cameron Brink, UConn's Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd and Notre Dame's Olivia Miles expected to go pro over the next few years.\nThe 2025 calendar year will be pivotal for the league even beyond expansion. While the current CBA runs through 2027, there is a mutual opt-out clause that could go into effect at the end of the 2025 campaign. The league's media rights deal with ESPN also runs through 2025. Engelbert has previously identified the new rights deal -- and as part of that the league's valuation -- as critical to the league's growth, and has said that expansion can help boost the league's value ahead of those negotiations. -- Philippou\nEngelbert said Thursday that details on how Golden State will build its roster will be discussed after the WNBA Finals when both the competition committee and board of governors meet. She said an expansion draft would likely happen in late 2024, after the draft lottery for the 2025 draft is held.\nWhile we don't know exactly how the process will go, we can look to history for precedent. In 2008, the Atlanta Dream built their inaugural roster of 13 players via an expansion draft by selecting from a pool of available players from the other 13 WNBA franchises, and by conducting multiple trades. For the expansion draft, which was held in February before free agency, each team was able to protect a maximum of six players who were not eligible for selection by Atlanta. The Dream could choose one player from each team regardless of contract status, although they couldn't select multiple unrestricted free agents. Atlanta then had the right to \"core\" that unrestricted free agent -- in the Dream's case, Betty Lennox.\nThe last time an expansion draft was held for multiple incoming franchises was in 2000: the still-running Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm as well as the now-defunct Miami Sol and Portland. In that expansion draft, the rules largely preserved existing teams, allowing them to protect eight of their nine top players. The new teams selected six players in the expansion draft and filled out their rosters in the 2000 draft or via trades.\nIn 2008, the Dream were assigned the No. 4 pick and did not participate in the lottery. In 2006, the Chicago Sky were assigned the sixth pick, behind the five teams that missed the playoffs the previous season.\n\nAgain, these aren't necessarily the rules the league will dictate as Golden State builds its roster, but they give us an idea of what could happen. -- Philippou\nAside from the Bay Area's women's basketball tradition and roots, the region makes sense from an economic perspective. Engelbert mentioned multiple times the potential to capitalize off Silicon Valley as a \"global hub of technology and commerce and innovation.\"\n\"Technology is driving our economy, and the tech center of your country doesn't have a WNBA team -- that doesn't seem right to me,\" the commissioner said. The Bay Area is also a big media market and had favorable \"demographics and the psychographics\" for a WNBA team, she said.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nEngelbert mentioned the importance of bringing in \"long-term owners committed to success, not just to the team and winning championships but to the league overall,\" and the Warriors seem like they'll fit that bill perfectly. The fact that this Golden State team will play in a state-of-the-art arena such as the Chase Center and practice in a NBA-grade facility in Oakland shows the standard for investment in the league is light-years better than where it was even five years ago.\nThe Warriors have the expertise on how to operate a massive successful basketball franchise, and Lacob has shown a commitment to women's basketball previously with his involvement in the ABL and the San Jose Lasers. He noted that the sport is in a much different place than where it was in the late-1990s, but also said, \"I'm a lot wiser now. ... We are a little more experienced and we're certainly well-capitalized and have good facilities.\"\nMany notable WNBA players have Bay Area ties: Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray, Danielle Robinson and Haley Jones are from the region. Stanford produced sisters Nneka Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike, as well as Brink, and Layshia Clarendon went to Cal. Bay Area fans would be even more excited about their new team should it manage to get any of those local legends. -- Philippou\nIt's important to remember the Monarchs franchise didn't fold for lack of fan support. It was one of the franchises that was a victim of the global financial crisis of 2006 to '08, and the Maloof family -- which then also owned the NBA's Sacramento Kings -- got out of the WNBA.\nThere were Bay Area fans who supported the Monarchs; now they won't have as far to travel. Between the Stanford fan base, former Monarchs and Lasers fans, and cultivating new fans, this organization should be able to establish a solid following. -- Voepel\nLacob boldly said in Thursday's news conference that the Golden State team will win a championship within its first five years of existence (something he also said when he purchased the Warriors). That said, history tells us not to expect too much, too soon from an expansion team. The last two franchises added to the league won a combined nine games in their first season of play, with Chicago going 5-29 and Atlanta 4-30. But their paths diverged from there.\nThe Dream landed Angel McCoughtry by winning the 2009 draft lottery and improved by 14 wins in Year 2, making the playoffs. A year after that, Atlanta reached the WNBA Finals for the first of three trips in four years led by McCoughtry.\nMeanwhile, the Sky were still struggling to make the playoffs despite arriving in the league two years earlier. Their first postseason trip didn't come until their eighth season in 2013, when the addition of future MVP Elena Delle Donne as a rookie to another future MVP in Sylvia Fowles produced a 24-10 record. Chicago made the Finals for the first time the following year.\nMaking the Finals in Year 3 might not be realistic for the Golden State franchise, but with the Warriors' resources, it's unlikely the process will be as slow as it was for the Sky. -- Pelton"}

(2:22)\nDick Butkus, arguably the fiercest Monster of the Midway, has died at age 80, the Chicago Bears announced Thursday.\nButkus became a Bears legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer in his nine-year career, which started in 1965. The middle linebacker was a vicious tackler whose intimidating presence put some players on their heels before the ball was even snapped.\nIn a statement released through the Bears, Butkus' family said he \"died peacefully in his sleep overnight\" at his home in Malibu, California.\n\"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" team chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looks for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership.\n\"He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. ... His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.\"\nDick Butkus was a legend who embodied what it means to be a Chicago Bear. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. pic.twitter.com/8UEVuuZLwi\nThe Bears took on the Commanders on Thursday night in Landover, Maryland, and a moment of silence for Butkus was held before kickoff.\nHall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones once called Butkus a \"maniac\" and \"well-conditioned animal.\" Butkus appeared to want to send a message with every tackle.\n\"I want to just let 'em know that they've been hit, and when they get up, they don't have to look to see who it was that hit 'em,\" Butkus once told NFL Films. \"It shouldn't be any puzzle. When they come to, they got to say, 'It must've been Butkus that got me.'\"\nIn a game against the rival Green Bay Packers during the 1970 season, Butkus and teammate Willie Holman hit quarterback Bart Starr so hard Starr lost his helmet and began walking toward the wrong bench.\nSaid the Chicago Tribune: \"[Starr] looked like Oscar Bonavena after Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] had finished with him.\"\nHe made the Pro Bowl in eight of his nine seasons, but a chronic knee injury abruptly ended his career in 1974 at age 31.\n\"Dick Butkus was a fierce and passionate competitor who helped define the linebacker position as one of the NFL's all-time greats,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Thursday. \"Dick's intuition, toughness and athleticism made him the model linebacker whose name will forever be linked to the position and the Chicago Bears.\n\"... We send our deepest condolences to the Butkus family, the Bears organization and the many fans and people he impacted throughout his life.\"\nButkus finished his career with 1,020 tackles and 22 interceptions. He was named first team All-Pro five times, won the George Halas Award in 1974 and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1979.\nHe also was named to the NFL's all-decade teams in the 1960s and 1970s and is a member of the league's 75th and 100th anniversary all-time teams.\nButkus spent his entire football career in Illinois. Born on Dec. 9, 1942, as the youngest of eight children, he grew up on the city's South Side as a fan of the Chicago Cardinals, the Bears' crosstown rivals. He played high school football for Chicago Vocational High School, earning a high school player of the year award as a junior.\nHe went on to compete in college at Illinois, where he played both center and linebacker. He helped the Fighting Illini to an 8-1-1 record and Rose Bowl victory in 1963. In his senior season, he made the All-America team and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting.\nThat led to Butkus being selected by the Bears with the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL draft. He had to fill the big shoes of Hall of Fame linebacker Bill George, but Butkus quickly showed he was up to the task. He set career highs with five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries during his rookie season.\nButkus would hit runners high, wrap them up and drive them to the ground like a rag doll. Sports Illustrated once called him \"The Most Feared Man in the Game.\"\nWhen the Detroit Lions unveiled an I-formation against the Bears at old Tigers Stadium, Butkus knocked every member of the \"I\" -- the center, quarterback, fullback and halfback -- out of the game.\nSaid teammate Ed O'Bradovich: \"Just to hit people wasn't good enough. He loved to crush people.\"\nA legend of the game & part of what makes the NFL's oldest rivalry so special. Sending our condolences to the family & friends of Dick Butkus & the entire @ChicagoBears organization 🙏 pic.twitter.com/dU7h8TtsWi\n\"I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately,\" Butkus once replied tongue-in-cheek when asked about his on-field reputation. \"Unless it was, you know, important... like a league game or something.\"\nButkus played for only two winning teams with the Bears, however, and never made the playoffs. He came on during the end of the George Halas era, just missing the 1963 championship season. In his final season, the Bears went 3-11.\nAfter he retired, Butkus sued the Bears for $1.6 million, contending he was provided inadequate medical care and owed the four years of salary remaining on his contract. The lawsuit was settled for $600,000, but Butkus and Halas didn't speak for five years.\nThat divide healed, however, and he became a staunch public supporter of the franchise. A year ago, he even took over the team's social media account for an evening, thrilling fans.\nThrough the Butkus Foundation, he helped establish a program at a Southern California hospital to encourage early screenings to detect heart disease. He promoted a campaign to encourage high school athletes to train and eat well and avoid performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe foundation oversees the Butkus Award, established in 1985 to honor college football's best linebacker. It was expanded in 2008 to include pros and high school players.\n\"Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch,\" McCaskey, who is Halas' grandson, said in his statement. \"His legacy and philanthropy included a mission of ridding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health.\"\nMany people knew Butkus more for his appearances in films -- such as \"The Longest Yard\" in 1974 -- and on television (\"My Two Dads\" and \"Hang Time\") after his playing days. He became a well-known pitchman in commercials. His Miller Lite commercials with Bubba Smith, in which they played off their menacing reputations, were especially well-known.\nButkus also was a sports broadcaster, even serving as a color analyst on Bears games.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame lowered its flags to half-staff in Butkus' honor.\n\"Playing in an era when middle linebacker became one of the game's glamour positions -- and several of Dick's contemporaries also would end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame -- his name most often was cited first as the epitome of what it took to excel at the highest level,\" Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement.\nButkus is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Ricky, Matt and Nikki. Nephew Luke Butkus has coached in college and the NFL, including time with the Bears.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

(0:32)\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- LSU Tigers star Angel Reese is well aware much was made about the closing moments of the women's basketball national championship game in April. LSU had sealed the program's first NCAA title, and Reese gave wrestling star John Cena's \"You can't see me\" hand motion toward Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark, then motioned to her ring finger.\nClark said after LSU's 102-85 victory in Dallas that she didn't really notice, but that she didn't think that Reese had done anything wrong. Clark said enthusiasm, emotion and even some trash-talking are a normal part of competitive sports, the same things she has done herself.\nThursday at LSU's media day, Reese shared similar sentiments. All eyes are on the Tigers -- they added top transfers Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow and are No. 1 in ESPN's preseason rankings -- and on Reese, the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. She said she is ready to move forward, but did address the hoopla from April.\n\"I love Caitlin; we've been competing since we were in AAU,\" Reese said. \"It was always fun, always competitive. One day, hopefully, we could even be teammates. She is a great player, shooter, person and teammate.\n\"The world is always going to have a good girl and a bad girl. I'll take that I'm going to be the bad guy because I know I've grown women's basketball and inspired people.\"\nReese laughed when it was pointed out that \"good vs. bad\" just depended on which team fans were rooting for.\n\"Yeah, LSU loves me, but they might not like her. People can think what they think,\" Reese said. \"Me and Caitlin are cool; we've never had any issues. Just knowing I've helped grow women's basketball, and she has, too, that's all that matters.\"\nReese also spoke of the news that the WNBA announced an expansion team Thursday, and how much she wants to play in the pro league and for the U.S. senior national team someday. Like Clark, Reese is a senior but could return for a fifth college season in 2024-25 because of the COVID-19 waiver.\nReese said she isn't thinking much now about whether she will enter the 2024 or 2025 WNBA draft. She said she will talk with her family, advisers and LSU coach Kim Mulkey about that when this college season ends -- which Reese hopes will be with another NCAA title.\nThe 6-foot-3 forward averaged 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds last season, had 34 double-doubles and has worked on her shooting range in the offseason. Morrow, a 6-1 junior forward who transferred from the DePaul Blue Demons, averaged 25.7 points and 12.2 rebounds last season. Both are eager to team up in dominating the paint this season for LSU.\n\"Angel is a competitor; I wanted to be around her every day,\" Morrow said of her decision to come to LSU. \"We are doing nothing but making each other better.\"\nAs good as the 34-2 Tigers were last season, Reese hopes they can improve. She's not just about winning games, but also winning over new fans.\n\"Women are changing the game,\" she said. \"I mean, 9.9 million people watched the [national championship] game. The feedback we've gotten, men and women reach out to us, celebrities, NBA players. Seeing we have so many people in our corner, I think that helps.\""}

He looks like third- or fourth-year LeBron.\"\nThe fact is, however, James is entering into his 21st season and as athletic as he still might appear, the team and its medical staff have to take measures to protect him in coordination with James' longtime athletic trainer, Mike Mancias.\n\"We collaborate and communicate on what those steps will be,\" Ham said. \"We make sure we come up with an effective plan.

The Mets entered the year with the largest payroll in Major League Baseball history and World Series aspirations. They ended it having dealt nearly a quarter of their major league roster at the trade deadline and finishing 75-87, fourth place in the National League East division and 29 games behind first-place Atlanta.\nEppler was hired in late 2021 after the Mets fired Zack Scott, their interim GM, who had been charged with DWI but later was found not guilty. Scott replaced Jared Porter, who was fired 38 days after being hired following an ESPN report that he had sent explicit text messages to a female reporter.\nStearns, 38, joined the Mets after seven seasons running the Milwaukee Brewers that included four playoff appearances. While his arrival in Queens had been long expected, there was no indication in his introductory news conference three days ago that Eppler would not be part of the team's infrastructure.\n\"He decided it is in everyone's best interest to fully hand over the leadership of baseball operations to David Stearns,\" Cohen said Thursday in a statement.\nEppler's first season with the Mets, whom he joined after five years as Los Angeles Angels GM, wound up with 101 wins -- and an ignominious loss to San Diego in the wild-card round.\nWhile Eppler warranted praise for a 2022 offseason in which he signed ace Max Scherzer and acquired steady starter Chris Bassitt, his lack of urgency at the trade deadline led to a trio of dud moves, as the team added only designated hitter Daniel Vogelbach, first baseman Darin Ruf and outfielder Tyler Naquin.\nAt the deadline a year earlier, in an ill-fated effort to make the postseason, the Mets had traded outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, who would become a top prospect, for infielder Javier Baez.\nThe Mets' spending spree this past winter brought back closer Edwin Diaz and center fielder Brandon Nimmo while adding future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander and Japanese star Kodai Senga to the rotation. Diaz's season-ending injury in the World Baseball Classic cast a pall on the season, and by the time the deadline rolled around, the Mets punted, trading Scherzer to the Texas Rangers and Verlander to the Houston Astros.\nNew York enters a seminal winter, with two-way star Shohei Ohtani -- whom Eppler signed as GM of the Angels -- reaching free agency and the Mets mulling the future of first baseman Pete Alonso, who is a year away from free agency and hired agent Scott Boras this week.\nThe Mets also will continue looking for a manager after Stearns fired Showalter, whom Eppler hired in December 2021, three months into his tenure."}

Last Friday, the 25-year-old wide receiver expressed frustration with his role in Chicago's offense, and he was made inactive a day later. Claypool was told by the team not to attend the Bears' game against the Denver Broncos on Sunday.\nThe team informed Claypool on Monday that he would be inactive for Thursday's game and requested that he remain away from the team while the Bears prepared for the Commanders.\nThe Bears sent a second-round pick to Pittsburgh last November for Claypool; the pick ended up being 32nd in the draft order.

(0:33)\nNorth Carolina wide receiver Tez Walker will be eligible to play in 2023 after new information emerged that the NCAA said school officials \"failed to provide\" previously.\nWalker is a transfer from Kent State, and his initial eligibility for the 2023 season was denied because he had transferred twice. His case became a flashpoint for NCAA rules, in part because Walker hadn't played during the COVID-19 season of 2020 at North Carolina Central, which did not have a season because of the pandemic.\nThursday's announcement did not specify what the new information was that prompted the NCAA to reverse its decision. Walker missed No. 14 North Carolina's first four games, which the NCAA intimated in a statement could have been avoided if the university staff had \"submitted this information weeks ago.\"\nEven with Walker's eligibility confirmed after months of public bickering, NCAA officials and UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham sparred publicly in statements Thursday in the wake of the decision. The NCAA said the \"entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided\" with timely submission of materials. Cunningham responded that UNC put forward the information as it was made available and said the NCAA \"delayed making the correct decision.\"\nThe school posted a video to social media later Thursday that showed Tar Heels coach Mack Brown delivering the news to Walker about his eligibility.\nThe moment @DevontezWalker found out he's eligible 💙🐏#CarolinaFootball 🏈 #UNCommon pic.twitter.com/DQLjUx6Dm5\nWalker, widely considered a top-50 prospect for next year's NFL draft, transferred to North Carolina in part to play with star quarterback Drake Maye.\nWalker is eligible to join the undefeated Tar Heels for Saturday's game against Syracuse, and a source told ESPN that he is expected to play, as he has been practicing with the team. His snaps are uncertain at this point.\nThe 6-foot-3 wide receiver hauled in 58 receptions for 921 yards and 11 touchdowns last season at Kent State.\n\"I'm so excited and thankful that the NCAA has granted my eligibility to play this season,\" Walker said in a statement. \"This hasn't been easy, but I'm looking forward to putting this in the past and moving forward. I always knew UNC was a special place, but it's proved it over and over again throughout the last few months. I've received so much support from the University, the athletics department, my coaches, the staff and my teammates.\"\nIn an unusually pointed statement, both NCAA president Charlie Baker and Georgia president Jere Morehead, the Division I board of directors chair, chastised North Carolina officials for their handling of Walker's case.\n\"It is unfortunate that UNC failed to provide this important information previously,\" the NCAA said in its statement, which is attributed to both Baker and Morehead. \"While we must be careful not to compromise a student-athlete's right to privacy when it comes to sensitive issues, we want to assure the Division I membership and everyone watching how the new transfer rules are applied, that this meets the new transfer waiver standards.\"\nThe statement concluded: \"UNC's behavior and decision to wage a public relations campaign is inappropriate and outside the bounds of the process UNC's own staff supported. Had the UNC staff not behaved in this fashion and submitted this information weeks ago, this entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided.\"\nUNC chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said in a statement: \"In our stated effort to exhaust all avenues, new information about this matter came to our attention and we immediately gathered and submitted it for consideration.

We want to express our gratitude to the people at UNC who have worked tirelessly to assist Tez. We never gave up. We also want to thank the NCAA for being willing to re-examine Tez's case, and ultimately deciding to grant him his eligibility.\"\nThe last previous ruling on Walker came Sept. 7, and it sparked criticism in statements from Brown and Cunningham.\nBrown said at the time that he didn't know whether he had \"ever been more disappointed\" in a group than he was in the NCAA. He ended his statement by saying: \"SHAME ON YOU!\" Cunningham called the decision \"maddening, frustrating and wrong.\"\nThat prompted an NCAA response the next week, with Morehead and another official chastising North Carolina officials and saying they were \"troubled\" by the school's response.

{"title": "Fitzgerald suing NU for $130M for wrongful firing", "date": "2023-10-06 01:30:08", "text": "Attorney Dan K. Webb announces a \"major lawsuit\" against Northwestern on behalf of former coach Pat Fitzgerald for wrongful termination. (2:35)\nCHICAGO -- Former Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald filed a wrongful termination lawsuit Thursday against the university and president Michael Schill, in which he is seeking in excess of $130 million for lost earnings as well as reputational and punitive damages.\nFitzgerald alleges Northwestern unlawfully fired him for cause July 10, three days after announcing a two-week suspension as part of corrective measures from a university-commissioned hazing investigation into the program. Northwestern's investigation, led by attorney Maggie Hickey, found that while claims of hazing from a former player were largely corroborated, there was not sufficient evidence Fitzgerald and other coaches and staff had knowledge of the incidents.\nAttorney Dan Webb, who filed the lawsuit, said Northwestern fired Fitzgerald based on \"no new facts, no new developments whatsoever, zero.\" Schill said July 8, hours after The Daily Northwestern reported details of the hazing allegations from the former player, that he \"may have erred\" with the initial discipline for Fitzgerald. Schill fired Fitzgerald two days later.\nWebb said Fitzgerald and Northwestern reached an \"oral agreement\" before the two-week suspension was announced that the coach would face no further discipline from the university.\n\"The fact that he was terminated based on no rational reasons or facts whatsoever, the fact that they've gone out and destroyed his reputation as one of the best football coaches in America, based on no legitimate reason or evidence, is disgraceful,\" said Webb, a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois who now serves as co-executive chairman of the Winston & Strawn law firm. \"It's despicable conduct on behalf of Northwestern. My client and his family are entitled to their day in court for justice.\"\nAfter conducting interviews with dozens of former Northwestern players and coaches, Webb said he does not believe \"any significant hazing occurred\" within the program but noted that new evidence could emerge at trial. He has asked for but not received Hickey's full investigative report; the university released an executive summary July 7 in announcing Fitzgerald's suspension. The lawsuit states that Fitzgerald fully cooperated with the investigation and was never confronted with any evidence he knew about hazing within the program.\nSince Webb is opposing Northwestern, he cannot talk to current players or coaches but expects to call them as witnesses at trial.\n\"They're going to say they didn't see any significant hazing other than horseplay ... between young men in the locker room,\" Webb said of those he has interviewed.\nThe lawsuit states that Fitzgerald met with Northwestern general counsel Stephanie Graham and athletic director Derrick Gragg on July 3. They presented him a plan where he would accept some punishment because of the findings in the investigation.\n\"Gragg also stated that Schill felt Fitzgerald needed to 'take a hit' for the findings summarized in the Hickey Report, even though the Hickey Report concluded that Fitzgerald and his staff did not know about any hazing activities within the Northwestern football program,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Gragg and Graham told Fitzgerald that if he agreed to this plan, wanted the two week suspension to coincide with Fitzgerald's two-week vacation, so Fitzgerald could attend an important recruiting event on Northwestern's behalf shortly after his suspension ended.\"\nWebb said the anonymous whistleblower who first came forward in November \"had a grudge against ... Coach Fitzgerald\" and that the player's plan to report false allegations of hazing was reported to Fitzgerald by a teammate during a leadership council meeting in November. A current player told ESPN in July that the whistleblower had informed him of a detailed plan with the sole objective to take down Fitzgerald. The current player relayed a conversation he said he had with the former player early this year to Northwestern trustees and other influential university figures.\nIn a response to Thursday's lawsuit, Northwestern said \"multiple current or former\" players under Fitzgerald admitted to investigators hazing that \"included nudity and sexualized acts\" occurred. The university also referred to the lawsuits filed by more than a dozen former Northwestern football players against the university -- many named Fitzgerald and Schill as defendants -- alleging they experienced and/or witnessed hazing while in the program under Fitzgerald, who led Northwestern's program from July 2006 until earlier this year.\nA two-time national defensive player of the year at Northwestern, Fitzgerald was the winningest coach in team history, going 110-101.\n\"As head coach of the football program for 17 years, Patrick Fitzgerald was responsible for the conduct of the program,\" Northwestern said in a statement. \"He had the responsibility to know that hazing was occurring and to stop it. He failed to do so. ... The safety of our students remains our highest priority, and we deeply regret that any student-athletes experienced hazing. We remain confident that the University acted appropriately in terminating Fitzgerald and we will vigorously defend our position in court.\"\nResponding to the claim Fitzgerald should have known about what was happening, Webb said, \"That's a ridiculous allegation, not supported by any evidence whatsoever.\"\nWebb said the out-of-pocket damages he is seeking for Fitzgerald include $68 million that remained on his contract, which ran through 2030, as well as future earnings losses of approximately $62 million. The lawsuit also is claiming reputational damages, emotional distress and punitive damages. Webb intends to call an expert witness who will show that Fitzgerald will \"not work again at the same level, ever again.\"\nThe lawsuit also claims no Northwestern player, coach or staff member ever reported hazing allegations directly to Fitzgerald. According to the claim, an anonymous complaint was submitted to the athletic department in August 2022 of \"serious misconduct and hazing,\" which Northwestern and police investigated and determined was unfounded.\nWebb noted Fitzgerald was proactive with anti-hazing training and told players, including freshmen and transfers, of a zero-tolerance policy within the program. Players also had several outlets to report hazing and mistreatment.\nSince July, Northwestern has implemented new mandatory anti-hazing training for all its teams before each season and hired former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to conduct a larger review of how allegations are reported in the program.\n\"Northwestern's hired a former attorney general that's going to come in and tell Northwestern where they somehow went wrong and could find a better program,\" Webb said. \"Well, they're not going to find it. My expert's going to explain to the jury that what Fitzgerald did was truly second to none in any coaching program in the United States.\"\nWebb said he talked with Northwestern about an out-of-court settlement but was \"unsuccessful.\"\n\"Settlement's always an option, but I have no reason to say that's going to happen,\" Webb said.\nA group of attorneys representing players who have filed lawsuits against Northwestern issued a statement in response to Fitzgerald's lawsuit.\n\"The filing of the lawsuit by former coach Patrick Fitzgerald is clearly all about financial gain for him and is incredibly tone deaf in defending his actions. His complaint ironically details claims that he was deeply involved in each player's life, mental health, academic career, athletic performance and potential after graduation ... all of which actually supports what we've been saying all along, that given the head coach's proximity he knew or should have known what was happening in his program. This is the legal standard: knew or should have known about the abuse, and we feel strongly that the civil lawsuits brought by his former players have merit. Together we represent numerous former players who have provided detailed allegations of abuse. We are united in our goal to get them the justice they deeply deserve,\" read the statement from the attorneys from Levin & Perconti, Ben Crump Law, Romanucci & Blandin and Hart McLaughlin & Eldridge.\nAttorney Margaret Battersby Black said she has seen evidence from more than 80 victims of the Northwestern hazing scandal (far more than the number of lawsuits filed so far).\n\"That [Fitzgerald] allows his lawyer to so callously call these former family members liars shows you everything that you need to know about the culture that he established at this school,\" Battersby Black said. \"And he's trying to continue to suppress and victimize these young men by painting himself as the victim.\""}

(1:06)\nMel Tucker's lawyers sent a 106-page letter that presents \"new evidence\" to Michigan State's interim president and board of trustees Thursday morning as the administrative hearing tied to the misconduct allegations against the former Spartans football coach began.\nThe letter, which is from one of Tucker's attorneys and was released widely to the media, says the woman who brought forth the claim against Tucker that led to his firing, sexual assault awareness speaker Brenda Tracy, \"appears to have made a career out of misleading and manipulating people.\"\nThe letter attempts to detail contradictions in the allegations from Tracy, who filed the formal complaint against Tucker with the school's office of civil rights in December 2022. It says she \"manipulated a key witness,\" \"deleted key evidence\" and selectively gave transcripts to the Office of Institutional Equity.\nTracy's attorney, Karen Truszkowski, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Truszkowski previously told ESPN that she and Tracy would be appearing at the school's sexual misconduct hearing.\nMichigan State fired Tucker for cause Sept. 27. The next day, Tucker's lawyers sent a note to preserve documentation \"in anticipation of litigation.\" At stake for Tucker beyond the hearing is the $79 million he had remaining on his contract. After initially suspending Tucker without pay pending the hearing, the school fired him, saying he violated the moral turpitude clause and that his admitted actions on a phone call with Tracy brought ridicule on the school.\nThe letter sent out Thursday is the latest in a tense back-and-forth between Tucker's side and the school, with this letter being sent by attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal. It attempts to catch Tracy in conflicting statements, using dozens of messages between her and her assistant, who is now deceased. It does not say specifically how the messages were obtained.\nThe letter, in part, alleges that Tracy's motivations for filing the complaint are financial. One of Tucker's lawyers shared what Tucker's team says are partially redacted parts of conversations Tracy had with her former assistant where they discuss her finances and the notion that she would be open to settling her claims with Tucker.\n\"I'm filing a formal complaint with MSU,\" Tracy wrote, according to the letter. \"... [My lawyer] said after that we can let him know that we want to come to an agreement then it doesn't have to go to a hearing or anything unless he wants it to.\"\nAccording to the messages provided by Tucker's lawyers, Tracy later added: \"Money is my only recourse to make him feel like there is a punishment\" and \"when they do the money I should make him pay me 10k directly.\"\nThe letter criticizes the MSU investigation for failing \"to attempt to get fulsome text exchanges\" for the Office of Institutional Equity investigation. It alleges the school left out Tracy having good feelings about her experience after Michigan State's spring game.\n\"Blessings on blessings when you stay the course and do what's right. ... No regrets. My heart is good and so is my conscience[.]\"\nThe messages came before the alleged phone encounter that became one of the focuses of the claim. Tracy said it wasn't consensual, but Tucker has disagreed.\nThe letter was released minutes after the hearing began Thursday morning. Tucker will not attend the hearing, the letter states, because of a medical condition the letter doesn't disclose."}

{"title": "Rivalry renewed: Cowboys-49ers matchup retaking its place atop the NFL", "date": "2023-10-06 12:34:02", "text": "Damien Woody details the importance of the Cowboys' matchup vs. the 49ers in a few weeks. (0:54)\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Less than an hour after the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys dispatched their Week 4 opponents, they had no desire to take the customary 24 hours to bask in their latest wins. They were already thinking about something else: each other.\nIn their locker rooms after beating the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots, respectively, multiple Niners and Cowboys wasted no time looking ahead to their Week 5 \"Sunday Night Football\" clash (8:20 p.m. ET, Levi's Stadium, NBC).\nAfter all, 49ers (4-0) vs. Cowboys (3-1) is not only a matchup of two of the league's best teams this season, but one of the most historically significant rivalries in NFL history. A rivalry that only recently has been brought back to life.\n\"It's an important game,\" said Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, who was San Francisco's offensive coordinator in 2005. \"You understand the history. There is obviously a lot of tradition with this game. That's all part of it. You live to play in these kinds of games. You dream about these kinds of games. You don't want to make it bigger than what it is, but the reality is it's not just another game.\"\nTheirs is a rivalry borne not out of geography or divisional alignment but of repeated meetings in the postseason crucible.\nIt started in the 1970s, when the Cowboys won consecutive NFC Championship Games over the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 seasons and bested San Francisco in a divisional playoff game in 1972. In the 1980s, the 49ers won four Super Bowls, beating the Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 10, 1982, on the strength of \"The Catch\" by Dwight Clark, arguably the most memorable moment of the rivalry.\nDallas came storming back in the 1990s, knocking off the Niners in the NFC Championship Game after the 1992 and 1993 seasons on its way to two Super Bowl titles. San Francisco finally got past Dallas the next season in the NFC Championship Game on its way to its fifth (and most recent) Lombardi Trophy. The Cowboys would bounce back to win their fifth (and most recent) championship the following year.\nAnd then ... nothing.\nThe teams did not meet again in the postseason until a wild-card game on Jan. 16, 2022, a span of 9,863 days. The teams met again last season in the NFC divisional round. The 49ers won both games by a combined 13 points, reviving the rivalry and setting the stage for Sunday night.\n\"Anytime you play each other in the playoffs, it's always usually a bit bigger the next year,\" said Niners coach Kyle Shanahan, who was a ball boy for the team in the 1990s when his father, Mike, was the 49ers' offensive coordinator. \"And with that being back-to-back, it was huge. That's what I always remembered growing up ...\n\"They played in the NFC Championship all three years that I lived here. So just playing them in the playoffs two years ago kind of was reminiscent of that ... and those histories stack up just like people in your division. But usually when it's a playoff game everyone remembers it a little bit more.\"\nSunday's matchup will feature many familiar faces from their past two meetings. Besides the head coaches, star players such as linebacker Micah Parsons, quarterback Dak Prescott, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, guard Zack Martin and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb still dot the Cowboys roster while the Niners lean on their own galaxy of stars such as defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner, running back Christian McCaffrey, offensive tackle Trent Williams and quarterback Brock Purdy.\nMost of those players were not born or were infants and toddlers for those 1990s playoff meetings, but the history of the rivalry has been ingrained and reinforced by the atmosphere surrounding the past two playoff matchups.\n\"You know prior to here, I saw it was definitely big,\" Parsons said. \"When they came down here [in the 2021 playoffs], I really saw it my rookie year and seeing it last year, how big that game was ... that impacted me that 'Oh, this is serious.'\"\nMarcus Spears explains that the Cowboys need to beat the 49ers as a confidence boost after dropping two straight playoff games to San Francisco.\nThe challenge this week for both teams is to understand how serious this meeting is without putting too much importance on it. Yes, it's only Week 5 and a loss probably won't determine each team's fate this season. But there are long-term ramifications that come with Sunday's result. Playoff seeding and home-field advantage might seem like far-off conversations, but a win Sunday night could go a long way in determining potential tiebreakers for those benchmarks.\nWhat's more, neither team has played a particularly daunting schedule to date. Dallas' opponents are 3-9 and San Francisco's 6-6 in games.\nSuffice to say, Sunday night should offer a good barometer of how far along these two expected Super Bowl contenders are.\n\"It's a huge test,\" Warner said. \"To say that it isn't would be naïve and downplaying the moment, I think. I'm excited for that moment. I know our team is excited for it.\"\nOne semi-new element is the introduction of the Sunday night lights. The 49ers and Cowboys haven't played a prime-time game against each other since November 1990. Their only other prime-time matchups came on \"Monday Night Football\" in 1977 and 1983.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nSunday's meeting will also likely break a tie in the all-time series, as the teams enter knotted at 19-19-1. In addition to their five Super Bowl titles apiece, the Niners and Dallas rank Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, all time in NFC playoff wins and conference championship game appearances.\nBut, as Cowboys owner Jerry Jones alluded to earlier this week, for as important as Sunday's meeting is, it very well could be a warmup act for a third straight playoff meeting in January. Because, as both sides are quick to remind, when you play for two of the NFL's most successful franchises, the only thing better than beating the other side is winning the whole darn thing.\n\"There's always a path in the NFC that goes through Dallas, goes through San Francisco,\" McCarthy said. \"I like to think that's what makes this sport so great, the respect you need to have for your history.\""}
{"title": "The Eagles are so good at the 'tush push' that the NFL may ban it", "date": "2023-10-06 12:34:02", "text": "Pat McAfee and crew examine the controversy around the Eagles' signature \"tush push\" play. (1:11)\nPHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Eagles were facing a fourth-and-1 at midfield early in the second quarter Sunday, and everyone in the stadium knew what was coming before the offense even lined up.\nA capacity crowd of nearly 70,000 rose for a standing ovation, anticipating perhaps the most talked about play in the NFL.\nThe \"tush push.\"\nOr is it the \"brotherly shove?\" The nicknames vary, but the results have been remarkably consistent.\n\"It's been a good play for us,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"A really good play for us.\"\nThe play is a glorified sneak where the quarterback is pushed forward by teammates lined up behind him. It has been wildly successful for the Eagles since they made it a regular part of their offense in 2022. They have run it 37 times in the regular season, per ESPN Stats & Information, and have gotten a first down or scored a touchdown on 34 of those attempts for a success rate of 92%.\nOther teams are following suit -- there have been 36 attempts through four weeks, up from five at this point in 2022 -- with mixed results. Four teams are 0-for-1, but the overall success rate is 81%.\n\"It's not as automatic as people think, as we're seeing across the NFL,\" Sirianni said.\nThese teams attempted the most push sneak plays since the start of the 2022 season, including playoffs, through Week 4.\nIt might not be automatic for the Eagles, but it's close. And their success might explain why it has become controversial, with critics saying it's more rugby than football and should be outlawed. The rules committee will review the play in the offseason, and the league alerted officials to watch for infractions such as illegal formations and blocks. The backlash prompted the take-your-whining-and-stick-it standing ovation during Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders as Eagles fans showed their support for a play that has become part of the team's identity.\n\"Well, it's not being officiated as illegal, so we just have to prepare for it,\" Washington defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio said before the game. \"I would personally like to see it eliminated, not just because they run it better than anybody, although they do run it better than anybody. But I don't think that's a football play. I think it's a nice rugby play, and it's not what we're looking for in football.\"\nThe debate is starting to heat up. The NFL competition committee was \"split\" over whether to outlaw the play this offseason, per Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay, who is also the chairman of the competition committee. There wasn't enough support to propose a rule change at the league meetings in March, but multiple members of the committee said they'd further analyze the play this coming offseason, when more injury-related data will be available.\nOn Monday night, two members of the New York Giants -- rookie center John Michael Schmitz and tight end Daniel Bellinger -- were hurt while executing a tush push in the first quarter of a 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, and they did not return.\n\"I think in the near future, rules might change,\" Tampa Bay Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield said. \"But for now, offenses might as well take advantage of it.\"\nThe fact that not all teams have taken advantage as successfully as the Eagles strengthens the argument that the play is less about the push and more about the men attached to the tush.\n\"There is clearly a talent to it that our guys have,\" Sirianni said. \"I get that some people are complaining about it, but stop it. Stop the play.\"\nSirianni couldn't pinpoint exactly how the quarterback push made its way into the Eagles' scheme, but he cited the goal-line sequence at the end of the 2005 classic between USC and Notre Dame as the moment the play pierced the football world's collective consciousness.\nWith the Trojans trailing by three with seven seconds left, quarterback Matt Leinart ran a sneak and was greeted by a wall of Irish defenders who appeared to have had him stopped. But Reggie Bush flew in and shoved Leinart into the end zone for the score.\nThe play -- known as the \"Bush push\" -- was against the NCAA rules at the time (although not any longer), but no flag was thrown.\nAlso in 2005, the NFL removed language from the rulebook that prohibited pushing a ball-carrier forward. But the purpose was to eliminate a tough judgment call for the referees, not to open the door for the modified QB sneak.\nThere was concern by officials that in some of the goal-line situations it was \"very hard to tell when a guy was coming in to block and when a guy was coming in to push. So we took it out,\" McKay said in March. \"We did not think it would become a strategy, and here we are.\"\nThe first Eagles tush push in ESPN's database came in Week 1 of last season against the Detroit Lions, when they snuck it on fourth-and-1 for a first down to secure a 38-35 win.\n\"I love pushin', man,\" said Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert, one of the players responsible for muscling Hurts through the line of scrimmage. \"It's fun to be back there. It's fun to see the defeat on defenses' faces before we even run the play.\"\nSome players inside the Eagles locker room are hesitant to share the intricacies of the play. \"You don't go into McDonald's and ask for the Big Mac sauce recipe,\" guard Landon Dickerson said. But the basic tenets are cut and dry.\nHurts picks a gap on either side of the center, and dives in after the snap. As soon as he meets resistance, the two players behind him rush in and begin to push Hurts forward.\nThe Eagles have one of the most savvy centers in the game in Jason Kelce, and he's surrounded by massive men in Dickerson (6-foot-6, 332 pounds), Jordan Mailata (6-8, 365 pounds), Lane Johnson (6-6, 325 pounds) and -- to a lesser extent -- Cam Jurgens (6-3, 303 pounds).\nThen there's Hurts, the former high school powerlifter who can squat 600 pounds -- a level of strength that comes in handy when you're trying to force your way through a mass of humanity.\n\"They're putting the two H-backs right behind the quarterback, and it's kind of like a rugby scrum,\" said Dan Koppen, a former New England Patriots center who helped pave the way for arguably the best QB-sneak artist of time, Tom Brady. \"And now you've got 1,500 pounds upfront. You've got a 200-250-pound quarterback [Hurts is listed at 223], and then you've got 250-400 pounds more pushing from the back.\n\"It's a really hard play to stop.\"\nOut of the 36 attempts at the push this season through Week 4, 29 have resulted in first downs, including four touchdowns.\n\"It helps having a guy like Gabe Davis or Reggie Gilliam behind you pushing the pile,\" said Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. \"Those are two strong guys.\n\"But I think it's just kind of low man wins. If our O-line can get low, and I can get low behind them, we're going to have some success. Now if it's the other way around, not so much success.\"\nThe QB push against the Commanders that had the Lincoln Financial Field crowd on its feet didn't count. Dickerson was called for the rare offensive offside. The Eagles were penalized 5 yards and had to punt.\nKelce said the NFL had given them notice the week leading up to the Washington game that it was going to \"start looking for offensive players sneaking into the neutral zone.\" Sirianni confirmed it was a point of emphasis for officials that week. Video appears to show Dickerson's hand in line with the ball pre-snap, but Kelce said that was actually his hand, as he gets into a four-point position on QB sneaks.\n\"I think they messed this up actually,\" Kelce said on his \"New Heights\" podcast. \"But that's what happens when you go searching for things.\"\nAfter declining to bring the legality of the play to a vote in March, the competition committee sent out a memo to all 32 teams recommending that the NFL football operations department \"closely monitor\" specific techniques utilized by the offense, including illegal formations, chop blocks and personal fouls \"like spearing and use of the helmet by an offensive player in an effort to gain leverage and push the pile forward.\"\n• Why the 'tush push' might get banned\n• Love's completion rate ranks last\n• O'Brien sees glimpses with Jones\n• Stroud knew Collins would be special\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\n• Saints look for offensive change\n• Cowboys, 49ers renew rivalry\nOne common thought is defenses will begin taking extreme measures to halt the play now that it is gaining in popularity with a reputation of being unstoppable.\n\"My fear now is some of the linemen are going to get some knees chopped,\" New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr said. \"And soon as that happens, I'm sure there'll be a rule change.\"\nCommanders coach Ron Rivera, a member of the competition committee, indicated the QB push will be put further under the microscope this offseason.\n\"It is something that we all have to study,\" Rivera said. \"There'll be a lot of issues that'll come up. There'll be some safety issues that'll probably be brought up. There may be some refereeing issues that'll be brought up, but I can't speak for anybody else on it. I think it will be a point of conversation.\"\nTime might not be on the side of the tush push, but the rest of the 2023 season offers an opportunity to those who have mastered the play.\n\"We did a lot of studies on everything in the offseason to help ourselves be even better at it,\" Sirianni said, \"but it's about those guys up front. It's about Jalen.\n\"I think we would be pretty successful without the push, but we're just pushing them sometimes to give that extra thump.\"\nContributing: John Keim, Brooke Pryor, Todd Archer"}
{"title": "Arsenal should be concerned by Man City's return to form ahead of heavyweight clash in Premier League", "date": "2023-10-06 12:43:55", "text": "Nedum Onuoha explains why he isn't worried that Manchester City's defense has had trouble holding teams scoreless. (1:38)\nManchester City go to Arsenal on Sunday for a top of the Premier League table clash with confidence restored and normal winning service resumed.\nI was on hand in Germany to watch Pep Guardiola's team boss possession and the game in their 3-1 win over RB Leipzig on Wednesday in the UEFA Champions League, inspired by a moment of genius from Julián Álvarez as he chipped a delicious goal to effectively win the game following a spell of stubborn resistance from the Bundesliga side. The result ended any concerns that City might be showing signs of vulnerability after successive losses to Newcastle and Wolves.\nThe defending Premier League champions have not lost three games in a row in a single season since 2018 and never looked like doing so in Leipzig, where their share of possession was a staggering 88% at one stage.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nThe return of midfield anchor Rodri, who was available to play in Europe despite his current domestic ban, made a significant difference. Manchester City lose only seven percent of games when Rodri plays, rising to 33% when he is missing.\nYou can easily make the case that he's one of the team's mot valuable players, and the good news for Arsenal is that Rodri cannot play on Sunday. It is the final game of his three-match suspension and so the key to this big match might be how effectively City can cover Rodri's absence in that \"No. 6\" role.\nGuardiola clearly does not trust Kalvin Phillips and Mateo Kovacic; for all his class, Kovacic failed when handed the job in the shocking defeat by Wolves. John Stones, out since the Community Shield in August, is fit again and was on the bench in Germany. He has the nous and passing range to play that anchor role if needed, but is he going to be ready or sharp enough for a start against Arsenal after seeing so little action so far this season? It is a difficult dilemma for Guardiola, who will have to improvise in a key area of the pitch.\nOne man who certainly advanced his case in Leipzig was 18-year-old Rico Lewis, who was a bundle of ideas and energy alongside Rodri. When asked to assess the display of the Manchester-born youngster, Guardiola smiled broadly and said, \"Wow!\"\nMore cheer for City is the return from injury of Bernardo Silva, which means Kevin De Bruyne is the only significant name still in the treatment room. Against that, however, Jack Grealish looked subdued in the Champions League after returning from a nasty leg injury, and against Arsenal he could lose his starting spot to the pacy and direct Jérémy Doku, who scored City's third goal in Germany.\nMeanwhile Erling Haaland, typically a goal-scoring machine, is experiencing a rare dry spell. Five games without netting is his longest Champions League drought, and he hardly got a kick against Wolves' warhorse Craig Dawson last weekend. However, a hungry Haaland is never quiet for long and still has eight goals in 11 games this season.\nArsenal, for whom the title is a holy grail, not having won it since the 2003-04 season, will certainly provide a far stiffer test than a rather unambitious Leipzig. Still stinging from the way City conquered them last season, the Gunners approach will be fascinating in manager Mikel Arteta's latest mind game against his old City boss and mentor, Guardiola.\nYou suspect Arsenal's Champions League loss at Lens, where Bukayo Saka picked up an injury, might have been caused by minds already focused on the big clash against City. It is not in Arsenal's DNA to sit back at home and play on the counter, but Wolves showed that denying City's playmakers those half spaces might be the most effective game plan.\nHowever, a bolder, adventurous approach by Arsenal could easily backfire. Consider this: Both Fulham and Spurs have gone to the Emirates and exploited defensive shortcomings in 2-2 draws.\nThe gap between the teams narrowed to only one point last weekend, with City atop the table on 18 points, but their midweek win in Saxony sent out an ominous warning that City are back to their winning ways. And that, more than anything else, should worry Arsenal."}
{"title": "Who should struggling Chelsea have signed instead? Osimhen, Szoboszlai, more", "date": "2023-10-06 12:43:55", "text": "James Olley explains why the short-term pressure on Chelsea to get results will all fall on Mauricio Pochettino. (1:05)\nChelsea spent an unprecedented £1 billion across the last three transfer windows, but it hasn't really worked so far. The club have won two of their seven games, drawing two and losing three under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and sit 11th in the Premier League table -- already 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester City.\nWhile they have amassed a group of some of the most-talented young players in the world, all on long-term contracts, it's possible their strategy might have been better focused towards more experienced players who could make an immediate impact.\nHindsight is a wonderful thing, but here's who Chelsea should have put their faith in over the summer.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nHaving let Romelu Lukaku (loan to AS Roma), Kai Havertz (£65 million to Arsenal) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (free transfer to Marseille) depart, Chelsea were left with the injured 22-year-old Armando Broja and untried Brazilian 18-year-old, Deivid Washington as the only out-and-out centre-forwards in the squad.\nNicolas Jackson, who arrived for £30m from Villarreal this summer, can also play through the middle, despite having the skillset of a winger or even second striker. While Raheem Sterling (£47.5m), Mykhailo Mudryk (£62m) and, before his long-term injury, Christopher Nkunku (£52m), can all do a job as a \"false No. 9.\" However, with a proven goal scorer arguably the first priority when revamping a side, you would have thought Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly would have signed one.\nChelsea have scored just seven goals in their seven Premier League games -- Man City have 17, for context -- and Sterling is their top scorer with two.\nJulien Laurens explains why Napoli's social media posts mocking Victor Osimhen couldn't have come at a worse time.\nLast season's Serie A top scorer for Napoli is widely regarded as one of the leading centre-forwards in the game, arguably behind only Man City's Erling Haaland and now-Bayern Munich star Harry Kane in the pecking order of world-class No. 9s.\nNapoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is known for driving a hard bargain, but a fee of £150m would likely have got a transfer done -- long before the Italian club upset their star man by making fun of him on social media -- which is small change for a club that have spent so much across the rest of the team, especially on untried teenagers.\nOsimhen, 24, is an excellent finisher (26 Serie A goals last season; five from six games this campaign) and the Nigeria international's movement across the defensive line, speed to stretch the opponents and aerial strength would be of exceptional value to a team that are a lot better at creating chances than converting them.\nParis Saint-Germain beat their rivals to secure a loan move (with a £56m obligation to sign permanently next summer) for Ramos. The 22-year-old Portugal international may not have set Ligue 1 alight yet (two goals in six games), but he's already proven enough for Benfica (41 goals in 106) and Portugal (eight goals in six) to show he is one of the top young central strikers in Europe.\nRamos features a fine holdup game -- useful for creating space and combining with the wide forwards or midfield runners -- is strong in the air and has a quick finishing technique too. In terms of playing style, he would certainly have offered a set of qualities that the Chelsea squad lacks, while they could have paid Benfica the fee up front without the need for a loan.\nVlahovic only arrived at Juventus from Fiorentina for around £70m in January last year, but struggled to settle. Linked with a summer move to every top club in Europe, the 23-year-old was given another chance to shine this season and has four goals from six games to date.\nThose who have monitored the left-footed centre-forward since his early days will know he carries lots of unreleased potential. But would his style have suited Chelsea better? Given that Juventus usually line up deeper (and tend to press lower), with longer distances between the attacking players, it's reasonable to assume that Vlahovic would have seen a lot more of the ball in goal-scoring positions at Chelsea.\nWhile he has less than five touches in the attacking penalty area per 90 minutes, chances are that a fresh start in a new environment could also have worked wonders for a forward who often looks short of confidence.\nStewart Robson and Gab Marcotti discuss Moises Caicedo's potential transfer to Chelsea from Brighton.\nChelsea have central midfielders in abundance and they're as young as they are immensely talented.\nNo-one would doubt the intrinsic quality of the likes of Enzo Fernández (£106.8m), Moisés Caicedo (£100m), Romeo Lavia (£53m), Lesley Ugochukwu (£23.5m), Carney Chukwuemeka (£20m) or academy graduate Conor Gallagher. Yet the latter is the most experienced performer at the heart of the team at the age of 23 now that N'Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic have been moved on.\nThough this midfield setup is undoubtedly part of the club's policy of hoarding the elite young talent around the world, an experienced presence to organise, lead and dictate the rhythm of the game and plug holes is key to the strategic functioning of the side. Some experienced football scouts and executives may argue that spending hundreds of millions of pounds on young talent is all well and good, but without a veteran or two the kids' talent may end up being wasted.\nWhile it wouldn't have been a popular move with the fans, Fulham's Palhinha could have taken the short trip across west London to do the kind of job Rodri is carrying out each week for Manchester City. Tactically disciplined and strong in the tackle, Palhinha is capable of making the rest of the team tick with swift intelligent passes -- short and long -- while expertly positioning himself poised for counter-attacks, tackles and interceptions.\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is a Norwegian football scout and executive and is the former chief executive and sporting director at AS Monaco. He will write regularly for ESPN on the business of soccer and the process of scouting.\nCaicedo and Lavia are outstanding at distribution and recovery, but it often takes years of elite-level football to attain the patience and game-reading skills required to operate as a defensive-minded holding midfielder.\nAt 28, the Portugal international may not fit Chelsea's approach to the transfer market, but the fact that Bayern Munich, a club known for well-considered spending, were prepared to part with £56m -- which would have made him their fourth-most expensive signing ever -- speaks volumes about how highly his understated qualities are valued.\nThe ESPN FC crew debate how new Liverpool signing Dominik Szoboszlai will fit in at Anfield.\nWhile Pochettino should have no complaints about the names he can select from in this department, there might be a case to be made for Chelsea adding a more defined playmaker-type to organise proceedings in the final third -- especially after letting Mason Mount depart for Man United.\nSterling is an experienced star, Cole Palmer (£35m) and Noni Madueke (£30m) are wildcards given their lack of experience at the age of 22, while the 21-year-old Mudryk is starting to show something of his obvious potential, but Chelsea were hit hard by Nkunku's injury. The France international is likely to provide a significant impact on his return, but without him there is a bit of a drop in quality.\nIt's still a bit of a mystery how Liverpool ended up signing Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig for his £60m release clause without any serious competition from other top European clubs (i.e. not only Chelsea.)\nFrom providing a significant goal threat from outside the box, to brilliant set-piece deliveries, while constantly inviting linkups and combinations with teammates in the final third, the Hungary captain is as elegant as he's efficient.\nThough Chelsea are not short of No. 8 midfielders, Szoboszlai -- who also has good physicality and a fine pressing-game -- could even do a shift deeper in midfield. And at 22, he certainly represents future value, too.\nWolves' winger might have been a useful addition to a squad which so far this season has struggled with end product. Rather inexplicably overlooked by bigger clubs this summer -- perhaps due to uncertainties after serious ankle and knee injuries -- the 23-year-old can operate equally well on either side of the attack and has experience of the Premier League since 2019.\nThough it can be argued that Neto, with his pace and outstanding dribbling ability, thrives better in a counter-attacking side, he still has the technical ability to adapt to a high-tempo team that dominate possession. His acceleration and one-vs.-one abilities also make him suited to unlocking teams that tend to sit deep, while cash-strapped Wolves would have likely listened to offers this summer. He is already being linked with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as Chelsea, for future windows."}

(1:17)\nThe NHL is in a torch-passing mood as it enters the 2023-24 season.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights are the reigning Stanley Cup champions, having earned their first title since coming into the league in 2017 as an expansion team. The Seattle Kraken defeated the 2022 champs, the Colorado Avalanche, for their first playoff series win in their second season of existence.\nFor the first time in nine seasons, the top 10 scorers in the NHL were all under 30 years old, including Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson and Vancouver Canucks center Elias Pettersson, both just 24 years old.\nThen there's the rookie class for this season, a remarkably deep collection of talent led by 2023 first overall pick Connor Bedard, who has lifted the Chicago Blackhawks back to relevance before ever appearing in a regular-season NHL game.\nBut not everyone is ready to let go of the torch. Veteran teams like the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins are trying to raise the Cup again after major offseason changes. Meanwhile, the megastars in their prime on the Edmonton Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs are desperate to finally win their first rings.\nIf you haven't kept up with the NHL in the past few months, don't fret, we've got you covered. Here's a chance to catch up on everything that has happened -- the hirings, firings, signings and even a blockbuster trade. It's all in our guide to the 2023-24 season for lapsed fans. Read up before the puck drops on opening night this Tuesday!\nHow to watch the 2023-24 NHL season on ESPN networks -- including 100 exclusive games and the out-of-market package (over 1,050 games).\nThe biggest surprise about the Golden Knights lifting the Stanley Cup might have been that it wasn't the Bruins doing it instead.\nThe 2022-23 Bruins were the most successful regular-season team in NHL history, setting league records for wins (65) and points (135) in a season. The NHL awards confirmed that they had the league's best goalie (Linus Ullmark), best coach (Jim Montgomery) and best defensive forward (Patrice Bergeron), along with a 61-goal scorer in winger David Pastrnak. They were a juggernaut offensively and defensively. The question wasn't if they would win the Stanley Cup, but how long it would take them.\nAnd then they were upset in the first round by the Florida Panthers -- who would go on to face Vegas for the Stanley Cup -- losing at home in a Game 7 overtime that left Boston fans and players in stunned silence.\nIt wasn't just a loss on the ice for the Bruins. The offseason saw Bergeron, their much celebrated No. 1 center and captain, retire after 19 seasons. Their second-best center, David Krejci, retired after 16 seasons. The Bruins had made it their mission to send both of them off as champions. Instead, they have to pick themselves up off the canvas without them.\nThey aren't the only departures from Boston: Wingers Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno, Tyler Bertuzzi and defenseman Dmitry Orlov all switched teams in the offseason, too.\nCan new captain Brad Marchand and the Bruins who remain get back to the playoffs with these lineup holes? Is their defense corps, led by Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm, and goaltending (Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman) dominant enough to contend again? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nIf the Bruins falter, or another of last season's Eastern Conference playoff teams struggles, all eyes are on a trio of Atlantic Division teams that have been rebuilding towards getting back to the playoffs.\nThe Buffalo Sabres have garnered the most interest, having not made the playoffs since 2011. They have a newly minted star center in Tage Thompson and two great young defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.\nThe Ottawa Senators also have a breakout star in forward Tim Stutzle, who joins players like Brad Tkachuk and Claude Giroux in trying to get the Sens their first playoff spot since 2017 under new owner Michael Andlauer.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, who haven't made the playoffs since 2016, hope their mix of established veterans and younger talents finally brings GM Steve Yzerman's plans into sharper focus.\nBedard, 18, is the latest generational talent who had teams, ahem, \"rearranging their rosters\" in order to maximize their draft lottery odds. Chicago had the third-best odds when it won the lottery to secure the services of Bedard, selecting No. 1 overall for the first time since drafting Patrick Kane in 2007.\nThe hockey world had anticipated Bedard's NHL arrival for years. He was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. He racked up player of the year awards and led the Canadian junior team to two gold medals. Scouts have raved about the quality and accuracy of his shot, which produced 122 goals in 119 games over the past two seasons with the Regina Pats. He's unquestionably the most hyped rookie to arrive in the NHL since another Connor: Oilers star and reigning NHL MVP Connor McDavid, who was drafted in 2015.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBedard arrives during a transitional time for Chicago.\nThe Blackhawks' reputation is still on the mend after the 2021 investigation that made public the sexual assault allegations by former player Kyle Beach against the team's video coach Brad Aldrich during the 2010 season. Stan Bowman, the team's GM and president of hockey operations, and senior vice president of hockey operations Al MacIsaac both resigned in the aftermath, with current general manager Kyle Davidson taking over.\nKane and captain Jonathan Toews, the last on-ice links to the Blackhawks' three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, 2015), both parted ways with the franchise last season. In July, Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz died at 70 years old following an illness.\nBedard's arrival has certainly helped change the vibes for the Blackhawks.\nThe team sold $5.2 million worth of tickets after winning the draft lottery. The Blackhawks tell ESPN that they expect an increase of over 17% in tickets sold and overall 26% higher revenue growth than our initial 2023-24 season projections. They've nearly doubled their full season-ticket packages sold year over year.\nChicago hasn't made the playoffs in three seasons and probably won't again in Bedard's first season -- although the Blackhawks bolstered their rebuilding lineup with familiar names like Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. But they theoretically have their next franchise player and, more importantly, a point of demarcation with the past.\nBedard is far from the only notable first-year player in the NHL this season. In a league that's all about speed, scoring and low salary cap hits, more young players than ever are breaking into the NHL early. Some other rookies to watch this season:\nLogan Cooley had announced he was returning to the University of Minnesota, but instead the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 signed with the Arizona Coyotes ... where he will still play in an NCAA arena this season, but we digress.\nCenter Adam Fantilli, 18, was selected third overall in the 2023 draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets after being projected as the second-best prospect behind Bedard all season. (No. 2 overall was Leo Carlsson of the Anaheim Ducks.) The University of Michigan product won the Hobey Baker as the best men's player in the NCAA last season.\nAnother Michigan alum is defenseman Luke Hughes, who brought some chaotic energy to the New Jersey Devils' playoff run. He's expected to be an offensive force this season on a team that features his brother, star center Jack Hughes.\nGoalie Devon Levi could be entrusted by the Sabres to lead them to their first playoff berth since 2011. He dazzled in a brief stint with them last season.\nThe Maple Leafs made winger Matthew Knies untouchable at the trade deadline last season, and for good reason: The Hobey Baker finalist from Minnesota brings offensive skill and physicality in his game.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nKyle Dubas bet on himself as general manager of the Maple Leafs, entering last season without a contract beyond 2022-23. He seemingly won the wager, as the Leafs advanced past the opening round for the first time since 2004 by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning before losing to the Panthers.\n\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBut as Dubas' agent and team president Brendan Shanahan worked on a new contract, there was drama brewing. The ask from Dubas went up, and reportedly so did the amount of power he wanted in personnel decisions. Dubas held a news conference that didn't sit well with Shanahan, saying his future in Toronto required \"a full family discussion.\" Ultimately, Shanahan decided to let Dubas walk, hiring former Calgary GM Brad Treliving as his replacement.\nDubas also made it seem like it was Toronto or bust in that news conference, saying, \"I definitely don't have it in me to go anywhere else.\" Then the Penguins came calling after they fired team president Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall and ... well, maybe Pittsburgh isn't like anywhere else.\nDubas was named president of hockey operations and oversaw a search for the team's next general manager before finding the perfect candidate: Kyle Dubas, who will serve in that role for the foreseeable future. The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins, tasked him with two missions: Start thinking about what the next phase of this team looks like while doing everything he can to help the team's veteran core -- Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang -- become Stanley Cup champions for a fourth time since 2009.\nHis first move was a bit of managerial magic: a three-team trade that saw him move out some of the team's cap-problematic contracts while acquiring 33-year-old San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson, who won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman last season. Karlsson scored 101 points in 82 games. Another season like that, and the Penguins might have one more championship push left in them.\nBesides the Karlsson trade, there were other significant trades in the offseason:\nThe Los Angeles Kings acquired center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Winnipeg Jets in a package that included forwards Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi. A 25-year-old restricted free agent, Dubois was handed an eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois gives the Kings one of the deepest groups at center in the West, along with Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault.\nThe Devils, who defeated the New York Rangers for their first playoff series win since 2012, traded for winger Tyler Toffoli, who led the Calgary Flames with 34 goals last season.\nThe Avalanche acquired center Ryan Johansen from the Nashville Predators, who picked up half of his $8 million cap hit for the next two seasons to facilitate the trade.\nAfter scoring winger Alex DeBrincat made it clear that he wouldn't re-sign with the Senators, they sent him to the Red Wings in a trade that included a first-round pick and forward Dominik Kubalik.\nThe Blue Jackets added two veteran defensemen via trade, acquiring Ivan Provorov (Flyers) and Damon Severson (Devils). Severson received an eight-year, $50 million contract extension.\nThe St. Louis Blues benefited from the Philadelphia Flyers' salary dump, as they traded a sixth-round pick for center Kevin Hayes and had Philly pick up 50% of his salary for the remaining three years of the deal.\nSome interesting names ended up in even more interesting locations via free agency:\nThe NHL had a buyout window that was more active than usual. The players changing teams after having the remaining years on their contracts bought out included Jets captain Blake Wheeler, now with the Rangers; Predators center Matt Duchene, who signed with the Stars; winger Josh Bailey, who was traded to Chicago by the New York Islanders after 15 seasons, bought out by the Blackhawks, and then signed a professional tryout contract with the Senators; defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who was bought out by Vancouver and signed with the Panthers; and defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who now has the honor of being bought out by two different teams, with the Flyers ending his time in Philadelphia so he could rejoin the Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Bruins saw their two big trade deadline acquisitions move on. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, who were already stacked on defense, and Tyler Bertuzzi signed a one-year deal to play on Auston Matthews' wing with the Maple Leafs. Michael Bunting, who played with Matthews last season, signed with the Hurricanes. The Leafs also signed free agent defenseman John Klingberg to a one-year deal.\nStar center Ryan O'Reilly, who was picked up at the trade deadline by Toronto, surprised many by signing a four-year deal with the Predators.\nGoalie Joonas Korpisalo, one of the only big-name goalies available as free agency opened, inked a five-year contract with the Senators.\nWinger Alex Killorn, an essential role player on Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup teams, signed a four-year deal with the Ducks after 11 seasons with the Lightning.\nDefenseman Matt Dumba was cap-squeezed out of Minnesota and signed a one-year deal with the Coyotes.\nWinger James van Riemsdyk, defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and winger Milan Lucic all signed with the Bruins. It's a homecoming for Lucic, who was a fan favorite during eight years in Boston (2007-15).\nWinger Vladimir Tarasenko didn't find the deal he wanted in free agency, changed agents and then inked a one-year contract with the Senators.\nAmong the players who avoided free agency by re-signing with their teams are two Golden Knights playoff heroes in forward Ivan Barbashev (five years) and goalie Adin Hill (two years); goalie Tristan Jarry, who signed a five-year deal to stay with the Penguins; defenseman Scott Mayfield (seven years), who remained with the Islanders; goalies Frederik Andersen (two years) and Antti Raanta (one year), who stayed with the Hurricanes; and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who remained with the Kings on a two-year deal.\nOne name still available as the season begins: Patrick Kane, who split last season with the Blackhawks and Rangers before undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in the summer. He plans to play in 2023-24 and is waiting to see what the standings look like as the season progresses.\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews ended any speculation about his pending 2024 free agency by signing a four-year contract extension in August that gave him the highest annual average salary since the NHL instituted the cap: $13.25 million, topping the record Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon set in 2022 ($12.6 million).\nOther significant contract extensions included Devils forwards Jesper Bratt (eight years, $7.875 million AAV) and Timo Meier (eight years, $8.8 million AAV); Ducks forwards Troy Terry (seven years, $7 million AAV) and Trevor Zegras (three years, $5.75 million AAV); Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson (eight years, $8.05 million AAV); Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson (seven years, $6.5 million AAV); Red Wings winger Alex DeBrincat (four years, $7.875 million AAV); Hurricanes center Sebastian Aho (eight years, $9.75 million AAV); and Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin (eight years, $8.25 million AAV).\nThe situation between Mike Babcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets presented an existential question for hockey fans: Is it really a coaching change if a new coach never actually makes it to training camp?\nBabcock was officially hired by the Blue Jackets in July on a two-year deal worth $4 million per season, to much fanfare from the team.\nHe had won a Stanley Cup with Detroit, two Olympic golds with Team Canada, and is 12th all-time with 700 wins. But after he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, stories emerged about Babcock's mental abuse of players with the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. His tactics would be under scrutiny as he returned to the NHL.\nOn the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast in September, former NHL player and current TV analyst Paul Bissonnette claimed that Babcock asked Columbus captain Boone Jenner to show him his cellphone camera roll before displaying those photos via AirPlay on the coach's office wall.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nFormer NHL defenseman Mike Commodore, who played for Babcock and has been a long-standing critic of the coach, said he heard this behavior also occurred during Babcock's time coaching the Maple Leafs.\n\"It happened with a few other players in Columbus, too,\" Commodore said in a video posted to X. \"I don't want to use any names, but in particular [it involved] a young, very highly touted prospect.\"\nThese claims were enough to spark an NHLPA investigation of the situation, as new executive director Marty Walsh interviewed Blue Jackets players in Columbus. The NHLPA then presented its findings to the NHL, and the two entities informed the Blue Jackets. On Sept. 17, Babcock resigned as head coach of the Blue Jackets days before the start of training camp, with associate coach Pascal Vincent taking over as head coach.\n\"Upon reflection, it has become clear that continuing as head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets was going to be too much of a distraction,\" Babcock said in a statement released by the team.\nBlue Jackets management took the blame for the debacle. \"We went through a process earlier this summer prior to hiring Mike Babcock as our head coach, but we got it wrong and that's on us,\" team president John Davidson said.\nIn other less contentious NHL coaching moves, the Capitals parted ways with Peter Laviolette, who quickly found a new gig coaching the Rangers after they fired Gerard Gallant. The Capitals hired 44-year-old Leafs assistant Spencer Carbery. The Predators hired Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette, who was a Jack Adams finalist in 2022 with Florida. Ryan Huska replaced Darryl Sutter in Calgary, while Greg Cronin took over for Dallas Eakins in Anaheim.\nThe NHL has three outdoor games scheduled for the 2023-24 season:\nThe Oilers and Flames play at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL Edmonton Elks, in the Heritage Classic on Oct. 29.\nThe Kraken host the Golden Knights in the 2024 Winter Classic at T-Mobile Stadium, home the Seattle Mariners, on Jan. 1.\nMetLife Stadium -- which saw both a Taylor Swift concert and Taylor Swift, Chiefs fan, this year -- hosts another historic event in February 2024. The Devils will host the Flyers on Saturday, Feb. 17, in an outdoor night game. The Islanders will host the Rangers on Sunday, Feb. 18. The event will mark the first time four NHL teams have played outdoor games at the same venue in front of fans.\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend will be held on Feb. 2 and 3 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\nThe 26-year-old Edmonton star set new career highs with 64 goals and 153 points in 82 games last season, winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP for the third time and the Pearson Award for NHLPA player of the year for a fourth time. His point total jumped by 30 and his goals by 20 year over year. No one's really sure what his ceiling is statistically.\nUnfortunately for McDavid and his superstar teammate Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers have had a ceiling in the playoffs. After losing in the conference finals last season, Edmonton fell to the Golden Knights in the second round this season. McDavid and Draisaitl have yet to play for a Stanley Cup since McDavid entered the league in 2015. Is this the year?\nWhile teams like the Avalanche, Golden Knights, Lightning, Penguins and Kings seek another championship after recently winning the Cup, other teams considered among the top contenders are seeking to end significant droughts.\nThe Hurricanes (2006), Devils (2003), Stars (1999), Rangers (1994) and Oilers (1990) all have gone well over a decade without hoisting hockey's grail, while teams like the Minnesota Wild and Panthers have never won the Cup.\nAnd then there are the Maple Leafs, seeking their first Stanley Cup win since 1967 -- a 55-season drought that's the longest in the NHL.\nFinally, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin continues his journey to break one of the most seemingly unbreakable records in sports: Wayne Gretzky's 894 career NHL goals.\nAfter tallying 42 goals in 2022-23, Ovechkin has 822 career goals at the start the season. That's 72 goals to tie and 73 goals to pass Gretzky. So while the record-breaking moment probably has to wait until at least next season, it'll be fun to see how close Ovechkin can position himself to it during 2023-24.\nUnless he decides to score 73 goals and be done with it. We're never one to underestimate Mr. Ovechkin as a goal scorer."}

It all culminates with a \"Monday Night Football\" matchup between the Packers and the Raiders on ESPN. (Game times are Sunday unless otherwise noted.)\n\nJump to a matchup:\nJAX-BUF | HOU-ATL | CAR-DET\nTEN-IND | NYG-MIA | NO-NE\nBAL-PIT | PHI-LAR | CIN-ARI\nNYJ-DEN | KC-MIN | DAL-SF\nGB-LV\nThursday: CHI 40, WSH 20\nBye: CLE, LAC, SEA, TB\n\n9:30 a.m. ET | NFL Network | Spread: BUF -5.5 (48.5)\nStoryline to watch: While it's a Bills \"home\" game, the Jaguars are on the second of back-to-back weeks in London, which means Jacksonville has the time zone experience advantage. But the Jaguars will be challenged to slow down a Bills offense that's averaging 5.9 yards per play (fourth) while the Jaguars' defense is allowing 5.4 yards per play (22nd). -- Alaina Getzenberg\nBold prediction: QB Josh Allen will score a touchdown, and so will ... LB Josh Allen. Not a big deal if Buffalo's Allen runs for a TD -- he has 40 over his career, including two this year -- but Jacksonville's Allen has just one TD in his five-year career: a 37-yard fumble return that gave the Jaguars a 20-16 victory over Tennessee in Week 18 last season. -- Mike DiRocco\nStat to know: QB Allen had four touchdown passes last week, the 10th such game in his career. He is tied with Jim Kelly for the most in Bills franchise history. The last quarterback to throw four TD passes in consecutive games was Joe Burrow in Weeks 16-17 in 2021.\nMatchup X factor: Jaguars cornerbacks Tyson Campbell and Darious Williams. Jacksonville has a strong run defense, and if these two corners -- who both have allowed lower than average yards per coverage snap this season, according to NFL Next Gen Stats -- can slow down the Bills' passing attack, the Jaguars have a chance. -- Walder\nInjuries: Jaguars | Bills\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Jaguars' defense allows the second most fantasy points to tight ends. Rookie TE Dalton Kincaid didn't have a great game against the Dolphins, but he did catch four of five targets for 27 yards. He ran more routes and was more involved in the passing game than Dawson Knox. The stage is set for Kincaid to have a breakout performance.

Bills' offense chasing history behind Allen, Diggs ... Who has to step up for Bills after White's Achilles tear?\n\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: ATL -1.5 (41.5)\nStoryline to watch: Atlanta's home/road splits with Desmond Ridder at quarterback are stark -- 4-0 and completing 67.9% of his passes with four touchdowns and one interception at home, 0-4 with a 58.6% completion rate, one touchdown and two interceptions on the road. That'll be an interesting thing to watch since the Texans have allowed quarterbacks to complete passes at a high clip (71.9%) when they're on the road, although they've given up only one passing touchdown. -- Michael Rothstein\nBold prediction: The Falcons' passing attack will be held to under 110 yards and will turn the ball over multiple times. The Texans are one of six teams with more interceptions (three) than passing touchdowns allowed (two) and pressure quarterbacks on 44% of their dropbacks, the third-highest rate. Ridder has been sacked 16 times, fourth most in the NFL, and the Falcons average the fewest passing yards per game (156). -- DJ Bien-Aime\nStat to know: Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud has thrown zero interceptions in his first 151 passing attempts, the third-most passing attempts without an interception to begin a career in NFL history (Dak Prescott, 176, and Tua Tagovailoa, 152). Stroud will face Jessie Bates III, who has collected three interceptions this season (tied for the most in the NFL).\nMatchup X factor: Ridder. He has just a 29 QBR so far this season, and that's nowhere near good enough to get the Atlanta offense going. The Falcons need more from him if they are going to beat a frisky Texans squad. -- Walder\nInjuries: Texans | Falcons\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Texans' defense has done an excellent job containing wide receivers -- allowing the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game to the position. They do, however, give up the seventh-most fantasy points per game to running backs, so expect the Falcons to double down on the running game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Falcons are 0-3 ATS in their past three games.

Stroud will continue to be mentioned as a top waiver wire pickup.\n\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: DET -10 (44)\nStoryline to watch: The Panthers are still looking for their first win of the season but will have to slow down a potent Lions offense to get it. Detroit's offense has scored at least 20 points in 13 straight games -- which is tied for the longest streak in franchise history (1995) -- and could get another boost with the return of wide receiver Jameson Williams, whose suspension for violating the NFL's gambling policy was reduced last week. Carolina's defense has allowed at least 20 points in every game this season. -- Eric Woodyard\nBold prediction: Detroit QB Jared Goff will pass for a season-high 350 yards and four touchdowns. The Panthers will tighten up their porous run defense. However, they won't be able to pressure Goff, who is going against a secondary that's missing two starters (CB Jaycee Horn, S Xavier Woods) and could be down a third if CB Donte Jackson (shoulder) doesn't play. -- David Newton\nStat to know: Lions tight end Sam LaPorta has 22 receptions this season, third among rookies and third among tight ends. With three receptions on Sunday, he will be the third tight end with 25 receptions in the first five games of his career since 1950, joining Keith Jackson (29 in 1988) and Jordan Reed (26 in 2013).\nMatchup X factor: Panthers receivers DJ Chark Jr., Jonathan Mingo and Terrace Marshall Jr. Carolina simply needs more out of its wideouts, aside from Adam Thielen, to support slow-starting QB Bryce Young. Mingo and Marshall are in the bottom five in the Receiver Tracking Metrics' overall score among wide receivers (Chark hasn't played enough to qualify). -- Walder\nInjuries: Panthers | Lions\nWhat to know for fantasy: No team this season has eclipsed 90 yards rushing against Detroit, which has held opponents to 243 total rushing yards. The Panthers could rely heavily on Hayden Hurst, Thielen and Chark on Sunday. Against tight ends, the Lions' defense gives up the fourth-most fantasy points. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Panthers coach Frank Reich is 5-2-1 ATS in his career as at least a 6-point underdog.

Reinstated from gambling suspension, is Williams finally ready to launch?  ... At 0-4, Panthers' offense, Young are failing each other ... Campbell sets realistic expectations for Williams\n\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: TEN -2 (43)\nStoryline to watch: The Titans have won five straight meetings with the Colts and six of the past seven between the clubs. The Colts' last win in the series came on Nov. 12, 2020, with long-retired Philip Rivers at QB. Additionally, the Colts have now lost seven consecutive games at home, their last win at Lucas Oil Stadium coming on Oct. 16, 2022, against the Jaguars. -- Stephen Holder\nBold prediction: WR DeAndre Hopkins will record his first 100-yard receiving game for the Titans. Hopkins' 65 yards against the Saints in Week 1 has been his best outing, but the Colts' pass defense has allowed 263.8 yards per game through four games this season. Indianapolis will be without starting CB Dallis Flowers, so Hopkins will have a prime opportunity to take advantage of the matchup against a reserve corner on one side and rookie JuJu Brents on the other. But he'll face a bigger challenge in the slot against Kenny Moore II. -- Turron Davenport\nStat to know: The Titans have scored fewer than 30 points in 22 straight games, the longest active streak in NFL and tied for longest streak in franchise history (22 straight in 1966-67).\n\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\nMatchup X factor: Colts running back Jonathan Taylor.

Meanwhile, the Dolphins have generated sacks on just 6.7% of opponents' dropbacks. Dolphins players and coaches have publicly stated that Sunday is not a \"get right\" game, but Miami's defense has an opportunity to right the ship against a reeling Giants offensive line. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nBold prediction: The Dolphins' high-flying offense will never take off against the Giants and will be held to under 24 points. New York played its best defensive game on Monday night and is sixth in the NFL with a 51.9% pass rush win rate. It will have some success creating havoc against a Miami offensive line that will be missing left tackle Terron Armstead. -- Jordan Raanan\nStat to know: Miami QB Tua Tagovailoa ranks first in yards per attempt on throws with motion, on quick throws under 2.5 seconds and on passes between the numbers. The Giants' defense ranks 24th or worse in all of those areas this season.\nMatchup X factor: Dolphins tackle Kendall Lamm. Lamm has filled in for the injured Armstead admirably with a 96% pass block win rate. Miami needs him to keep it up to keep Tagovailoa upright. -- Walder\nInjuries: Giants | Dolphins\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Giants' opponents have rushed for the eighth-most yards per game.

One major issue for the Patriots has been their turnover differential (minus-5), which ranks 27th in the NFL. One major issue for the Saints has been their red zone offense, which ranks last in the NFL with just four TDs in 12 trips. -- Mike Reiss\nBold prediction: The Saints will force two turnovers against the Patriots. While New Orleans' offense has struggled, the defense has been able to capitalize multiple times, getting an interception in three of four games and forcing a fumble in the one game without a pick. Patriots QB Mac Jones has thrown four interceptions this season, and the Saints are poised to get C Paulson Adebo back from injury, which could mean a prime opportunity for them. -- Katherine Terrell\nStat to know: The Patriots have the worst pass block win rate in the NFL (39.7%). And Jones is struggling throwing downfield -- he's 0-12 on passes of 25-plus yards.\nMatchup X factor: Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson. Which Jackson will New England get: the player who was a standout for the Patriots for years or the one who was a liability for the Chargers? The variance is high here and could matter quite a bit, given the Patriots' banged-up secondary. -- Walder\nInjuries: Saints | Patriots\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Saints' defensive front allows only 103.3 rushing yards per game. There is a good chance that New England's running game will get back on track sooner than later, but it is unlikely to happen against the Saints.

Pickett hasn't had a great start to the season, with a 29.3 QBR through four games, ranking 29th. But in last year's Week 17 win against the Ravens, he recorded an 82.5 QBR -- his highest of the season. Bouncing back against the Ravens' defense, though, is a tall task. The Ravens have allowed opposing quarterbacks to complete just 61% of passes and they've recorded 15 sacks, second most in the NFL. -- Brooke Pryor\nBold prediction: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson will toss four touchdown passes for the first time since September 2022. The Steelers are the only team that Jackson has thrown more interceptions (six) than touchdown passes (four) against in his six-year career. But Pittsburgh has allowed eight touchdown passes this season, which is the fourth most in the league. -- Jamison Hensley\n• Early mock drafts: Miller » | Reid »\n• Ranks: Kiper » | Positional top fives »\n• QB Hot Board » | Early predictions »\n• Projected draft order » | Read more »\nStat to know: Jackson has completed 74.3% of his passes this season, the second-best percentage in the NFL. He could become the first starting QB to complete 70% of his passes in each of his team's first five games since Derek Carr in 2020.\nMatchup X factor: Ravens wide receiver Zay Flowers. The Receiver Tracking Metrics make Flowers look like a hit so far. His 77 Open Score ranks eighth among wide receivers in 2023. That's a big help to the Ravens' offense. -- Walder\nInjuries: Ravens | Steelers\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Steelers' defense has allowed some superb performances to No. 1 receivers. Davante Adams, Nico Collins, Brandon Aiyuk and Amari Cooper averaged 31.7 fantasy points against Pittsburgh. Flowers leads the Ravens with 29 targets.

The Rams have not allowed more than 400 yards in a game this season and are allowing an average of 295.8 yards per game, which ranks ninth in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop\nBold prediction: Rams QB Matthew Stafford will throw three touchdown passes, doubling his season total. The Eagles have yielded nine touchdowns through the air this season, third worst behind only the Broncos (13) and Bears (10). Stafford has a chance to light it up, especially if receiver Cooper Kupp (hamstring) returns to the lineup as hoped. -- Tim McManus\nStat to know: Rams rookie WR Puka Nacua has 39 receptions for 501 yards this season (both are the most through four career games in NFL history). He needs one reception and 43 receiving yards for the most through five career games.\nMatchup X factor: Kupp. It remains to be seen if and how much he'll play, but if he does, this will be our first window into the Kupp and Nacua offense. Given Nacua's breakout and Kupp's return, the Rams' offense looks much more dangerous than we thought before the season. -- Walder\nInjuries: Eagles | Rams\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Eagles' secondary has struggled this season, allowing the sixth-most passing yards per game. Find a way to insert the Rams' pass-catchers into your fantasy lineups.

Arizona will try to keep it going against Joe Burrow, who has gotten off to poor starts all season and has been sacked eight times. -- Josh Weinfuss\nBold prediction: The Cardinals will rush for 175 yards. Cincinnati is 31st in rush defense (giving up an average of 157.0 yards per game), and Arizona is second in rushing yards per attempt (5.3). Combine those factors, and this could be a day for Arizona to make its presence felt on the ground. -- Ben Baby\nStat to know: Arizona QB Joshua Dobbs has thrown four touchdown passes and no interceptions this season. No Cardinals player has ever had five passing touchdowns and zero interceptions in his first five starts with the team since starters were first tracked in 1950.\nMatchup X factor: Bengals guards Alex Cappa and Cordell Volson. They rank 65th and 67th out of 67 qualifying guards in pass block win rate. Burrow is clearly not at 100% and needs better protection if he's going to get back on track. -- Walder\nInjuries: Bengals | Cardinals\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Bengals' defense has allowed the sixth-most rushing yards to running backs. Derrick Henry scored 24.4 fantasy points against Cincinnati's defense last week. The Bengals will now face James Conner. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Burrow is 27-18-1 ATS in his career but is 0-3-1 ATS this season. He has failed to cover five straight regular-season games.

The Broncos are last, or near last, in every major statistical category on defense. Their run defense is allowing 176 yards rushing per game, while the Jets have averaged 95.5 rush yards through four games. -- Jeff Legwold\nBold prediction: Hall will score two touchdowns for his first trips to the end zone since Oct. 23, 2022, in Denver. That day, he scored on a 62-yard run but was done for the season a short time after when he tore his ACL.

The player we saw in the second half against the Chiefs looked entirely different from, frankly, the rest of Wilson's career. Will he keep it up? I'm skeptical because the sample of him playing poorly is so much larger. But we'll see. Fortunately for Wilson, the Broncos' defense is a mess. -- Walder\nInjuries: Jets | Broncos\nWhat to know for fantasy: Even though the Jets' secondary is formidable, the Broncos have the best chance of attacking the defense with their running backs. The New York defense has allowed opponents to rush for the fifth-most yards per game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Broncos games have gone over the total in three straight and eight of the past nine games dating back to last season.

But will they dare use it against Mahomes, who, since the start of the 2020 season, has the NFL's best QBR (89.0) against the blitz? -- Kevin Seifert\nBold prediction: Mahomes will throw for 300 yards and won't have an interception. This type of game used to be a staple for him, but not this year. He has had only one 300-yard game and one without throwing a pick. But the Vikings are 21st in opponent QBR and yards allowed and have just one interception. -- Adam Teicher\nStat to know: Vikings QB Kirk Cousins has 11 passing touchdowns this season, the most in the NFL. He has thrown multiple touchdown passes in every game this season, the second-longest streak by a Vikings player to start the season since the 1970 merger (Tommy Kramer, six straight in 1981).\nMatchup X factor: Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison. Shut out on just a single target in last week's game, Addison needs to be a capable threat if the Vikings are going to keep up with the Chiefs' offense. -- Walder\nInjuries: Chiefs | Vikings\nWhat to know for fantasy: Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco has had the fourth-highest success rate (46%) among running backs since entering the league in 2022, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.

Can Jefferson catch Calvin Johnson?\n\n8:20 p.m. ET | NBC | Spread: SF -4 (45)\nStoryline to watch: It's hard to find a Week 5 game more enticing than this, as these two historically successful franchises renew their longstanding rivalry. In a game where turnovers always matter, they take on greater importance when two talented heavyweights clash. Dallas leads the league with 10 takeaways, while the Niners have just one giveaway on the season, tied with Dallas and Seattle for the fewest in the NFL. San Francisco beat Dallas in the divisional round last season in part because it was plus-1 in turnover margin. It stands to reason the outcome in this one will ride heavily again on which side takes better care of the ball. -- Nick Wagoner\nBold prediction: Niners QB Brock Purdy will have a pass intercepted. He has not had a pass picked off in his past five regular-season appearances. He was not intercepted in the win against Dallas in the divisional round, either. And he is coming off a game in which he had just one incompletion. So why will the Cowboys have a pick? That's what they do. CB DaRon Bland is coming off a game with two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. The Cowboys have seven interceptions on the season -- only Buffalo has more (eight). At some point, Purdy has to throw one to the other team. -- Todd Archer\nStat to know: Purdy has torched man coverage, ranking in the top three in QBR, yards per attempt and touchdown-to-interception ratio since entering the NFL last season. He'll face a Cowboys defense that has played man coverage at the highest rate in the NFL since the start of last season.\nMatchup X factor: Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan is notorious for targeting opposing linebackers with his offense. Dallas will need Vander Esch to be on his game. Good news for the Cowboys: He has allowed just 0.2 yards per coverage snap this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats, which is excellent. -- Walder\nInjuries: Cowboys | 49ers\nWhat to know for fantasy: This season, the 49ers are allowing only 3.9 yards per rushing attempt. This might not be RB Tony Pollard's breakout game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Cowboys are 26-12 ATS in the past three seasons, tied with the Lions for the best record in that span.

The Raiders All-Pro receiver said it would be \"weird\" to look across the field during warmups and see those familiar gold and green helmets with the oversized \"G\" on them after spending his first eight seasons with the Packers. Now in his second year with Las Vegas, Adams needs one TD catch to surpass Antonio Brown (31) and Jimmy Graham (31) for the fourth-most TD receptions in prime-time games in NFL history, trailing Hall of Famers Jerry Rice (46), Randy Moss (44) and Terrell Owens (34). -- Paul Gutierrez\nBold prediction: Green Bay WR Romeo Doubs will have a better stat line than Adams -- if Adams plays -- on Monday night. Doubs has been compared to him by some in the Packers organization, and here's his chance to show it's a worthy comparison. Doubs' three touchdown catches are the most by a Packers receiver in the team's first four games of a season since Adams in 2018. Doubs will add to that. -- Rob Demovsky\nStat to know: Packers QB Jordan Love has thrown at least one passing touchdown in all five of his career starts.

(1:10)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Washington Commanders limited partner Magic Johnson delivered harsh criticism of his new team following a 20-point loss to the Chicago Bears on Thursday night.\nAfter the Commanders lost 40-20 to the previously winless Bears, Johnson tweeted in part that \"the Commanders played with no intensity or fire. We didn't compete in the first half. ... It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing.\"\nTonight the Commanders played with no intensity or fire. We didn't compete in the first half and got down 27-3 heading into halftime. It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing 40-20.\nJohnson, who attended the game, is one of 20 limited partners with new owner Josh Harris. Johnson has been highly visible as part of the franchise, between charitable events and attending games.\nBut this was his first critical tweet of his new team. And the players did not disagree with his assessment. After all, Washington fell behind 27-3 at halftime.\n\"I'd probably say that's pretty fair,\" Washington receiver Terry McLaurin said.\n\"Definitely,\" defensive end Montez Sweat said. \"We came out flat.\"\nThe Bears scored on each of their five possessions in the first half, often because of missed tackles or blown coverages in the secondary. A defense that entered with two sacks recorded four. And an offense that averaged 298 yards in the first four games managed 451.\n\"We got our ass kicked,\" Washington defensive tackle Jonathan Allen said.\nWashington coach Ron Rivera said he couldn't repeat his postgame message to the players but that in short he told them, \"That's not good enough.\"\nThat's why no one in the locker room was about to reject what Johnson tweeted. However, some said there were other factors.\n\"I mean, that's perception when you're down that quick, it looks like that,\" Washington left tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. \"I'm not going to say the guys did not have any intensity or urgency coming into the game. I would definitely say it was a lack of execution early offensively; when they put up seven on the defense, we need to respond.\"\nMcLaurin said the Commanders' intentions, of course, were not to start that way. However, he said, intentions don't matter.\n\"It's what you put on the field,\" McLaurin said. \"I know we don't have a lazy bunch; I know we don't have a non-intense group of guys. That showing is not reflective of us, but that's who we are. We put that on tape. I'd say that's a pretty fair assessment [by Johnson].\"\nBoth teams were coming off difficult losses: Chicago had blown a 21-point lead at home to Denver; Washington had lost in overtime in Philadelphia. But one team was 2-2 and playing at home; the other was winless and traveling on a short week.\n\"I don't know if we thought they was about to give us the game,\" Sweat said. \"But them guys was hungry. They came out with more fire than us.\"\nJohnson has been complimentary toward the Commanders after other games. He lauded their effort against Philadelphia, saying he was proud and that he hoped that effort would be \"part of our DNA\" all season. He tweeted after a comeback win in Denver about his excitement watching the rally live.\nHowever, Thursday he opted for a different message -- one that was echoed in the locker room.\n\"When you don't get off to a fast start,\" McLaurin said, \"and a team that's hungry like that, fighting for every play, every yard and they're capitalizing, that's what can happen. The record didn't really matter. You don't come to play, that's what's going to happen to you.\""}

I'm grinding and doing everything I possibly can, and even the fact I'm going out there and practicing. I'm ahead of schedule.\"\nRising and Utah coach Kyle Whittingham had been publicly optimistic throughout fall camp that the star quarterback would be ready for the season opener against Florida. That never happened.\nRising was finally given clearance to practice without limitation in early September, but five games into the season, he has yet to appear in a game.\n\"I'm trying to make sure I can be out there because nobody wants to be out there on the field grinding with those guys more than me, but at the end of the day, it's my body. My body has to recover.\n\"I've just been focused on continuing to improve. I'm getting closer. I've got to keep making the days count.

The defending champion already was returning all of its starters from the 2022 title team -- including A'ja Wilson -- and now was adding a two-time MVP.\nOn Feb. 1, when players could officially sign contracts and offer sheets, the New York Liberty locked in Breanna Stewart in the biggest move in WNBA free agent history. Just 24 hours later, the Liberty added point guard Courtney Vandersloot. Those moves, after trading for 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones two weeks earlier, sparked immediate superteam talk.\nWith months to go before the season opened, many experts penciled in the Aces and Liberty for a WNBA Finals matchup.\nBut there were questions: How quickly would the Liberty get all the pieces put together? Could the Aces book a return trip to the championship series? The answers have been answered emphatically. After months of talk of superteams and destiny, the 2023 WNBA Finals matchup many envisioned tips off Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App).\nThe series has the potential to be epic. The Finals will feature a trio of former MVPs, five former No. 1 draft picks and two of the best point guards in the world.\nAnd now, after the longest season in league history (the WNBA expanded its regular season to 40 games this summer), the question is whether the Aces will become the first team to win back-to-back championships since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-02, or whether the Liberty -- the last remaining original franchise yet to win a title -- will finally get their first?\nESPN looks at how the teams match up.\n😮‍💨 these are tuff @_ajawilson22 #RaiseTheStakes pic.twitter.com/hXUo6IYFgT\nA'ja Wilson, F/C: The Aces' centerpiece since arriving in Las Vegas with the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2018, she's already a two-time MVP (and almost won her third this season) and the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year for two years running. Indisputably one of the best players in the world, she has been unstoppable in the postseason, last month becoming the first player to score at least 30 points in three consecutive playoff games. She's averaging 25.8 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.2 blocks and shooting 59.5% in the playoffs.\nChelsea Gray, PG: Don't be fooled by Gray's draft slot; she has two titles on her resume and is known as the Point Gawd. After a knee injury cut short her senior season at Duke, she was picked 11th overall in the 2014 draft. She sat out 2014 and played just 16 MPG in 2015 for Connecticut. Gray was then traded and was a reserve on the Sparks' 2016 title team (she had a huge performance in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals). A regular starter since 2017 (when she helped lead L.A. back to the Finals), Gray signed with the Aces as a free agent in 2021. She was WNBA Finals MVP last season, when she averaged 21.7 points and 7.0 assists in the postseason.\nKelsey Plum, G: The San Antonio Stars selected Plum, the all-time NCAA Division I scoring leader, with the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft. She has been with the team ever since, most recently signing a two-year extension in 2022. After suffering a torn Achilles and missing the 2020 season, Plum has been better than ever, with her scoring jumping more than six points per game in 2021 over her 2019 averages. She was Sixth Player of the Year in 2021 and averaged a career-best 20.2 points during the Aces' title run last season.\nJackie Young, G: ESPN's Michael Voepel wrote last month that the Aces have one of the best guard trios in WNBA history, and Young completes the puzzle. The No. 1 overall pick in 2019, Young was moved to point guard early in her WNBA career, but has flourished as a 2/wing alongside Gray. After hitting 22 total 3-pointers over her first three seasons, Young made 50 in the 2022 regular season -- when she was named the league's Most Improved Player -- and 89 in 2023. A 25% 3-point shooter in 2021, she hit 44.9% of her treys in 2023.\nKiah Stokes, C/F: Drafted by New York late in the first round of the 2015 draft, Stokes played for the Liberty for six seasons. When they waived her in July 2021, the Aces signed Stokes and she played in all 10 of their 2022 playoff games. She's averaging just 2.8 points in the postseason, but she is a perfect complement to Wilson and smartly picks her spots. And Stokes' numbers are up across the board in the playoffs, where she's averaging 27.9 minutes (vs. 19.8 in the regular season), 8.6 rebounds (vs. 5.9), 1.4 steals (vs. 0.7) and shooting 54.5% from the field (vs. 43.4%).\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BENCH\nBad news: There isn't much of one beyond Alysha Clark. Good news: Clark was the No. 1 option off the bench this season. The 2023 Sixth Player of the Year is a relentless defender and two-time champion (she started every game of the Seattle Storm's 2018 and 2020 title runs). Over five playoff games, Clark is averaging 8.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 20.9 minutes.\nParker (9.0 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 3.7 APG, 23.6 MPG) has been out since before the All-Star Game, after surgery for a left-foot fracture, and isn't expected to play. Riquna Williams, a key part of the Aces' 2022 championship, hasn't played for the team this season. Sidelined early with a back injury, Williams was then barred from the team following a July arrest on domestic violence charges. The charges were later dropped.\nAnd then there were two teams left standing 🏆The 2023 #WNBAFinals presented by @YouTubeTV tip-off Sunday October 8th at 3pm/ET where the top seeded @LVAces will host the @nyliberty in Game 1 Tune in on ABC pic.twitter.com/7v8HIoa1iv\nBreanna Stewart, F: She simply wins wherever she goes. Four NCAA titles at UConn. Two championships in her first five WNBA seasons. So, can Stewart -- who won this season's MVP (23.0 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.6 BPG, 1.5 SPG, 46.5% shooting in the regular season) in the closest three-player race ever -- lead the Liberty to new heights after making the biggest move in free agency history? The No. 1 draft pick in 2016, Stewart personifies today's positionless basketball. Like Parker before her, Stewart can do it all, whether it's bring the ball downcourt, defend with a ridiculous wing span, hit the 3 or drive inside. Keep an eye on her shooting; she struggled in the first round and semifinals.\nJonquel Jones, F/C: The Liberty's superteam status wouldn't be complete without Jones' request for a trade from the Connecticut Sun. She was hampered by injury early in the season, but that has all changed since the All-Star break. She has had a double-double in every postseason game and is averaging 16.5 points and a league-leading 12.8 rebounds in the playoffs. As ESPN's Alexa Philippou wrote last month, Jones might be the X factor in New York winning its first title.\nSabrina Ionescu, G: This is the player the Liberty envisioned when they drafted the NCAA's all-time leader in triple-doubles No. 1 overall in 2020. Last summer, Ionescu became the first player in WNBA history to tally 500 points, 200 rebounds and 200 assists in a single season, and she's even more consistent in 2023. New York's leading scorer in three of its five matchups with Las Vegas this season, Ionescu can change the game with her 3-point shooting and ability to hit clutch shots in big moments. After COVID canceled the 2020 NCAA tournament -- where Oregon would have been a No. 1 seed and among the favorites -- is this the year Ionescu wins the 'ship?\nCourtney Vandersloot, PG: One of the game's premier passers, Vandersloot has plenty of options around her in New York and led the league in assists for the seventh time in her career with 8.1 per game in the regular season. Vandersloot, who like Stewart in February signed for well below the maximum salary available so the Liberty could have room for others on the roster, knows how to navigate a team to a championship; in 2021, she and Parker teamed to bring the Chicago Sky their first. Jones, Stewart and Vandersloot -- among other WNBA stars -- combined to help Russian club team UMMC Ekaterinburg win a crown a couple of years ago. Now can they do it in the WNBA?\nBetnijah Laney, G/F: Cut by the Indiana Fever after she'd already packed for the bubble season in 2020, Laney persevered, ultimately playing for Atlanta that season and tripling her scoring average to earn Most Improved Player honors. In the 2020 offseason, the free agent and former second-round draft pick then signed a reported three-year contract with the Liberty. As pointed out by Philippou, Laney has scored at least 19 points in all five of New York's postseason wins after averaging 12.8 points in the regular season. She's also hitting 43.8% of her 3-pointers after shooting 39.2% beyond in the arc in the regular season.\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BENCH\nEvery bench gets shorter in the postseason, but one of the biggest surprises with the Liberty is how much they've relied on their starters, all of whom played at least 37 minutes in the decisive Game 4 of the semifinals.\nThroughout the playoffs, the Liberty also have gotten 93.7% of their points from starters, per ESPN Stats & Information, which is on pace to be the fourth-highest rate in a postseason in WNBA history (minimum two games). That said, guard Marine Johannes (7.1 PPG in the regular season), forward Kayla Thornton and center Stefanie Dolson -- who was also on Chicago's 2021 title team -- have all made contributions throughout the season and made sure depth was among New York's strengths.\nThe @nyliberty are your 2023 WNBA Commissioner's Cup Champions presented by @coinbase 👏They defeated the Aces, 82-63 to take the crown for the first time in franchise history ‼️ pic.twitter.com/c6V8UXeBev\nThe Aces and Liberty met five times before the WNBA Finals:\nJune 29: at Aces 98, Liberty 81 -- The game marked the seventh consecutive win for the Aces.

{"title": "Why Lonzo Ball believes he'll play for the Chicago Bulls again", "date": "2023-10-06 13:38:59", "text": "Bulls guard Lonzo Ball talks about his rehab process and plans to play again despite a series of knee surgeries. (0:42)\nNASHVILLE -- A FEW WEEKS before the start of training camp, a Chicago Bulls executive flew to Los Angeles to check on Lonzo Ball.\nIt has been more than 20 months since Ball played in an NBA game, with three knee surgeries and a few devastating setbacks under his belt. And while what the executive observed from Ball as he completed his daily rehab process might have seemed mundane, it was notable.\nBall hasn't progressed to the point in his rehab where he has picked up a basketball, but the progress he has made, though small, gave the 2017 No. 2 overall pick the confidence to declare he will \"definitely\" play again.\n\"After the other surgeries, this one has definitely gone the best as far as [the] recovery process,\" Ball told ESPN outside the training room while the rest of the team began training camp in Nashville this week. \"The last two rehab processes I had, I was getting better and then it just hit a standstill and it started going down. And I haven't hit that yet.\"\nBall is finally getting through his rehab process -- starting on the training table, an intense stretching routine, followed by mobility and strength work -- without the lingering pain and discomfort that had plagued him since the start of 2022.\n\"Honestly, being out for as long as I've been out and all the injuries I have to deal with I think you just have to be positive,\" he said. \"First and foremost. If you lose your mind, you're going to lose the battle. So it always starts with being positive and hoping for the best.\"\nBall has been hoping for the best since Jan. 14, 2022, when he checked out of the fourth quarter of a blowout loss to the Golden State Warriors, the last time he saw action in an NBA game.\nIf and when Ball returns -- he has already been ruled out for the 2023-24 season, but is targeting a 2024-25 return -- he will have missed more than 1,000 days of action. Returning from such an absence to be a productive player is incredibly rare. Still, Ball, who will turn 26 later this month, isn't discouraged by the history or the long odds.\n\"It's motivation for me because there's been people that have been counted out,\" Ball said. \"For me, it's about getting back and doing what I want to do and love to do, which is play basketball.\"\nBALL HAS KNOWN he would play basketball professionally since at least the seventh grade.\nHis father, LaVar, made sure his three sons -- Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo -- were always competing against older kids until the trio reached high school. Lonzo and LaMelo dominated high school basketball, going 35-0 at Chino Hills in 2016, winning a state title and ranking No. 1 in the nation.\nHowever, Lonzo Ball's first five NBA seasons (two with the Los Angles Lakers before being traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in 2019, then joining the Bulls via sign-and-trade in 2021) have been slowed by injuries. And while he had arthroscopic knee surgery before training camp in 2018, he has never before gone this long without playing basketball.\n\"That's been the hardest part, not being able physically to play,\" Ball said. \"It's hard for me to watch the games honestly because I know what I can do out there, and the fact that I literally can't help on the court, it's hard for me to deal with. ... But just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that if I keep getting better and putting the work in, I'll be able to play again.\"\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBall still watches his share of basketball, especially games including his brothers (LaMelo stars for the Charlotte Hornets, and LiAngelo plays for their G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm), but for the most part, Ball has dealt with his time away from basketball internally, mostly leaning on his family and friends to stay grounded.\n\"He's had to go through this on his own a lot,\" Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who tore the ACL in his left knee in 2017, told ESPN. \"That's what injuries are. It's in between the ears. That's how you keep yourself going.\n\"As a friend and as a teammate, I just try to help him whenever he asks. He's a guy that doesn't ask for a lot. You can tell, he doesn't want to rely on other people.\"\nInstead, Ball has turned to hobbies off the court to fill the time basketball once occupied. He's playing video games for the first time -- some NBA 2K, but mostly Madden -- and is working on a documentary on his high school team that went 35-0. But mainly, he has started writing music again.\nBall released a few rap tracks earlier in his career and even competed on \"The Masked Singer,\" but he hadn't dropped any new music since 2020. Now, during his time away from basketball, he has found solace in music again, producing songs to fit the documentary.\n\"I like to write,\" he said. \"Whether it's in my notes, on my computer, on my iPad, I'm always writing something.\n\"It's just like a release. As far as music for sure. I get to just write about what's happened in my past and what I see with my own two eyes and just put it on paper. It helps me get stuff out.\"\nWHEN THE BULLS brought Ball in during the 2021 offseason to team up with LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, they envisioned a high-powered offense that would lead them to the top of the Eastern Conference. And for a brief moment, that's exactly what they got.\nChicago started the 2021-22 season 27-13 and led the East by a game over the Miami Heat when Ball last played. With him out of the lineup, they lost four of the next five games to drop out of first place, and slid all the way to sixth by the end of the season.\nBall first had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee in 2022 with an initial return timeline of six to eight weeks. When his knee did not improve, he underwent a second surgery in September 2022 near the start of training camp.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nLast year, amid season-long uncertainty about whether Ball would be able to return, the Bulls battled just to reach the play-in tournament, where they fell to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Heat in the game for the eighth seed. In March, Ball underwent a cartilage transplant surgery on his left knee, which resulted in him being ruled out for all of 2023-24 as well.\n\"We all know how much we love and miss Lonzo,\" LaVine said. \"You can't replace a guy like that.\"\nAlthough the Bulls remain optimistic, sources said the organization is still unsure if Ball will ever play for them again, knowing he still has a long way to go in his rehab process. But his progress following this most recent surgery has given all parties involved reason for hope.\n\"It's good to see him in good spirits because it's never a good thing when you have somebody that's that talented and basketball is taken away from you,\" LaVine said. \"To see him working his way back, being around the team, seeing him in the weight room, seeing him on the court doing things, it's a sight for sore eyes.\"\nThe last two players to go more than 1,000 days between games are Emeka Okafor and Greg Oden, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information, and neither played even 30 games in the lone season they played after their returns.\nThe most optimistic comparison for Ball is perhaps Bill Walton, who was a two-time All-Star and NBA MVP by the time injuries forced him to miss three out of four seasons, including more than 900 days in a row at one point. Walton came back to play 245 games after missing all that time, including 80 games in 1985-86 (when he won Sixth Man of the Year honors), and played his final game at age 34.\nKlay Thompson missed two whole seasons because of knee and Achilles injuries before returning in 2021-22, then leading the NBA in 3-point field goals in 2022-23. Shaun Livingston suffered a devastating knee injury while playing for the LA Clippers in 2007, when he was 21 years old.

Despite not being able to participate in basketball activities, he joined the team in Nashville and plans to split time rehabbing between Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\"Any step positive for him promotes a better outlook,\" DeRozan told ESPN. \"He's been the most positive a person can be through this whole process of taking away something he was so great at for these last couple years. ... Even the other day on the team plane, you realized how much we even missed him: being the DJ, playing cards, laughing, joking, talking s---. You miss that. Just to see him in rare form like that means a lot.\"\nAnd while it might come as a surprise, maintaining that positive outlook, even in the face of such an extended absence, has come naturally to Ball.\n\"That maybe sounds hard, but for me at the end of the day, I know that I'm still very blessed and I'm still better off than a lot of people in the world,\" he said. \"I can't complain about the injuries that I've had. I still have a great life. A lot of my family is healthy. Besides basketball, there's no real struggles in my life and I'm just blessed for that.\""}
{"title": "Fields, Moore break out as Bears snap 14-game losing streak", "date": "2023-10-06 13:40:05", "text": "DJ Moore tallies eight receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns in the Bears' victory over the Commanders. (1:10)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears put on a first-half show against the Washington Commanders in a 40-20 win at FedEx Field on Thursday.\nFields threw for three touchdowns in the opening two quarters -- two to DJ Moore and one to Cole Kmet -- to help the Bears to a 27-3 lead at halftime.\nThe Commanders opened the second half with a touchdown on their first drive, but the deficit proved too big as the Bears held on to snap a franchise-worst 14-game losing streak that dated back to last season.\nThe win moved Chicago to 1-4 on the season. Washington dropped to 2-3 with the loss.\nThe Bears had enough of the negativity, of the outside noise, of the heartbreak they had endured for 11 straight months. On a short week with no time to waste on distractions, Chicago ended its 14-game losing streak and beat the Commanders on the road.\nLast week, Fields felt the Bears' offense was finally beginning to show its identity. After a lightning-fast start and third-quarter lull, Chicago showed it could finally put away an opponent and leave nothing in doubt in the final minutes of the game.\nOne week after giving up 21 points en route to a devastating loss, the Bears' 20-point win is tied for the fourth largest in NFL history by a team entering on a double-digit losing streak.\nBuy/sell a breakout performance: DJ Moore found the end zone on two of Chicago's five scoring drives in the first half. His Randy Moss-like catch over Commanders cornerback Kendall Fuller and first-half stat line (five catches, 137 yards, 2 TDs ) helped the Bears build a 24-point lead going into the half and even had LeBron James marveling at the receiver's explosiveness on X. Moore's fourth-quarter touchdown -- his third of the game -- put the game away for Chicago on a night when he notched the second-most receiving yards in a game (230) by a Bears receiver.\nEncouraging trend: The Bears sacked Commanders QB Sam Howell five times -- which is great considering the team had only two sacks in its four previous games -- but two of those were generated by linebacker T.J. Edwards and cornerback Greg Stroman Jr. (who also recorded the team's first interception of the season against a starting quarterback). Chicago remains committed to pressuring with its four down linemen, but the line didn't break through until Yannick Ngakoue brought down Howell on second-and-9 in the fourth quarter. DeMarcus Walker and Rasheem Green recorded two more sacks late.\nQB breakdown: Fields became the first Bears quarterback to throw for three or more touchdowns in back-to-back games since the 1970 merger. He built upon his three good quarters against the Denver Broncos and has completed 43 of 64 pass attempts for 617 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception in his past two games, complete with a 131.2 passer rating. Most importantly, Fields didn't let a slow start to the second half hinder him from putting the game away when he found Moore for a 56-yard touchdown with 4:18 to play.\nNext game: vs. Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)\nThe Commanders' defense was supposed to provide a foundation while their offense matured. Instead, the defense sabotaged yet another game.\nThe Commanders allowed at least 30 points for a fourth consecutive game in losing to the Chicago Bears 40-20 on Thursday night. The Commanders (2-3) have lost three consecutive games, including their past two home games by a combined 77-23 score.\nIt's one thing to lose at home to Buffalo; it's another to lose at home to previously winless Chicago. Considering the Commanders have a young quarterback in Howell, the defense needed to provide a lot more. Instead, it gives up big plays and has not caused a turnover in the past two games.\nThe defense talked all offseason and summer about starting fast, knowing that the unit added only one new starter in linebacker Cody Barton, in addition to first-round corner Emmanuel Forbes. But the Commanders have been bad. Thursday, they allowed an offense that ranked 21st entering the game in both points and yards to score a season-high 40 points and gain 451 yards. Washington needs to make it work with this group. It had a chance to gain momentum with upcoming games at Atlanta and the New York Giants. Instead the team exits this game with many questions about its defense -- and its future.\nTroubling trend: Washington's defense continues to allow too many big plays. The Commanders entered having allowed 13 plays of 25 yards or more, tied for worst in the NFL. Then they allowed three more in the first half alone Thursday night en route to a 27-3 deficit. A huge culprit has been a secondary that has looked inconsistent. Rookie Emmanuel Forbes, who was benched in the second half, has struggled mightily allowing big plays. There were, once more, big gaps in coverage that Fields exploited.\nTroubling trend, part 2: Poor pass protection. This has been another season-long problem as Howell was sacked five more times, giving him 29 for the season. The Bears, who entered with two sacks in four games, applied consistent pressure with four-man rushes and blitzes. Some of the problems stem from Howell needing to progress through his reads quicker. But the line has been too inconsistent in this area and needs to provide more help for a quarterback who now has six starts to his résumé.\nQB breakdown: Howell's growth remains pivotal to the franchise's future. Howell showed, once more, that he's a resilient and tough quarterback. After a rough first half -- 9-for-13, 71 yards and an interception -- he threw for 298 yards in the second half. He moved well in the pocket, was patient with underneath throws, and though the Commanders lost, he continued to show he can be developed. Speeding up his progressions and learning to protect himself from hits should be points of emphasis going forward.\nNext game: at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)"}

In fact, what is considered perhaps the most epic game in Red River Rivalry history was one of those ties. The 6-6 stalemate of 1976 ignited wild conspiracy claims of spying. It was fitting, considering President Gerald Ford, he of the Warren Commission and the pardoning of Richard Nixon, was in attendance.\nYou want symmetry? How about all of that you just read, plus a game location of Dallas because Big D was seen as the perfect Red River DMZ, located almost exactly halfway between the two campuses in Austin, Texas, and Norman, Oklahoma. And then there is that seating configuration. The Cotton Bowl is split exactly down the middle, the 50-yard line acting as a Bowie knife, evenly dividing the 92,100-seat oval into equal halves of UT burnt orange and OU crimson and cream. That leaves entire sections of hundreds of fans left sitting with their shoulders mashed and colors clashed for four hours in the Texas heat. As former Horns head coach Mack Brown once explained: \"It's not like your home crowd or your away crowd, where it's loud for you and quiet for the opponent. In this game, somebody is screaming every play.\"\nSpencer Rattler loses the football right into the hands of Texas linebacker Juwan Mitchell. Sam Ehlinger would score for the Longhorns on the ensuing drive.\nYou want a heart-stopper? Just go back and watch the highlights of this game over the past decade alone. From 2014 through 2021, the largest margin of victory was eight points and the average score over eight contests was Oklahoma 36, Texas 32. Heck, just watch that eight-point game. The 2020 contest was an anti-'76 affair that stretched into four overtimes and was played for nearly five hours before former Sooners QB Spencer Rattler -- who had been benched earlier in the game for fumbling -- threw a TD pass to Drake Stoops, son of former Sooners head coach Bob Stoops, to win the game 53-45. Or, if you want to take that question literally, you could step outside the stadium gates and directly into the Texas State Fair, the event that envelopes the Cotton Bowl and this game, and choke down a basket of deep-fried cheesy crab tater bites or a plate of deep-fried honey butter brisket swirls. My Crestor bottle started vibrating just by me typing that.\nFrom Darrell Royal and Bud Wilkinson to Billy Sims and Earl Campbell to Ricky Williams and Baker Mayfield and, yes, this weekend with Quinn Ewers versus Dillon Gabriel in a battle of undefeated College Football Playoff hopefuls, every single time these two teams have met, the stakes -- and steaks -- have been scorching hot.\nBut this year, the official framing of the game comes with some sadness. As if a famous western wear store was suddenly closing shop. The end of an era. Texas and Oklahoma's last cleated steps in a long march together as members and co-anchors of the Big 12 Conference.\nONE YEAR FROM now, this game will be played again, just as it has been every autumn since the turn of the previous century. Only from 2024 and beyond, it will be an SEC matchup. Ever since July 21, 2021, when the news broke of the schools' joint decision to break ranks with the Big 12 and reach out to the SEC, collegiate athletics has been a never-ending Jenga puzzle, pieces pulled from conferences coast-to-coast and then jammed back into any available opening in any and every manner necessary to keep the entire tower from crumbling down. So many of those moves don't make sense. What they generate in cash they seem to equally lose when it comes to the valuation of regional relevance and tradition.\nThe banks of the Red River are certainly a long way from The Swamp of Florida or the Congaree River that flows by South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium on its way down to Charleston. But the two states whose shared border is drawn along that Red River also snap nicely into the left side of the continuous jigsaw map that represents the footprint of the Southeastern Conference. There are no gaps, from the Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico all the way into the Great Plains as they roll up into central Oklahoma.\nHowever, much more crucial than cartography is the calendar. The Red River Rivalry's streak of games played will not be stopped, unlike so many other rivalries that have at worst been completely sunk or at least been put on extended hiatus by the cold spreadsheets and shredded maps of realignment (*clears throat* ahem, Texas-Texas A&M).\nThis is not the first time this game has undergone an extreme matchup makeover. Yes, it has served as the centerpiece event of the Big 12, but only since 1996, when the conference was formed out of necessity during the first real lineup shakeup of college football's modern age. Prior to that, Oklahoma-Texas was not an in-conference matchup.\nFrom 1920 through '95, the Sooners were not a member of the Southwest Conference, a fact that would no doubt stump any younger-generation football fans at their local sports bar's trivia night. They were in the Big Eight, which had been the Big Seven, the Big Six and, in the beginning, the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association.\nTexas was a founding member of the Southwest Conference in 1915 and remained there until it collapsed in 1995 to give way to the Big 12. OU was also an OG Southwest member but left at the end of the 1919 season.\nSo, if you're scoring at home, and plenty of Sooners and Horns certainly are, then through Saturday, over 119 games played, the Red River Rivalry has been a conference showdown 33 times, five in the Southwest and 28 in the Big 12. That's only 28% of the games. The other editions of the game have been everything from a clash of independents to Southwest vs. Big 8 to SWC vs. MVIAA.\nIN OTHER WORDS, when one backs up and looks at the bigger picture, whether it be in black-and-white silver emulsion or gigapixel high resolution, the concept of OU and UT in the SEC doesn't seem all that strange, certainly when compared to the other incongruous college sports chess moves that will be taking place at the same time as theirs next fall.\nThe difference? This game -- in the minds of so many, the game -- isn't going anywhere.\n\"I don't need but maybe one or two of things in my life to still be there all the time so that I know it is still my life,\" explained Barry Switzer, who coached in 22 Red River Rivalry games, six as an Oklahoma assistant and 16 as head coach. His comments came in late summer 2021, not long after the news of the move to the SEC had broken.\n\"As long as that game is on that weekend in that place, I suppose I can make the rest of it work.\""}
