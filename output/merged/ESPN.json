{"title": "Connor Bedard and the rookies you need to know", "date": "2023-09-27 19:53:55", "text": "Several fresh-faced NHL newbies are not only poised to make an impact on the ice in their respective markets but within the field of fantasy hockey as well. Here's a look at 10 such rookies invested managers will want to watch closely heading into the 2023-24 fantasy season.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nConnor Bedard, F, Chicago Blackhawks: First off, a hearty congratulations to every dynasty/keeper league manager blessed with this year's precious No. 1 draft selection. Not only is the pick itself a no-brainer, but the runaway Calder favorite is likely to pay out rich fantasy dividends for years and years to come. Straight out of the gates, we know Bedard is poised to provide a hearty serving of minutes on the Blackhawks' top line and power play alongside veteran Taylor Hall. There's little question of that.\nAll that's left to forecast is whether he scores 60, 80, or near 100 points. My preseason guess is somewhere in the point/game range, at least to start. Hardly matters though; if you have the chance to pick Bedard in dynasty play, you're picking him. Otherwise, he initially presents as a Top-35 fantasy forward in re-draft leagues.\nAdam Fantilli, F, Columbus Blue Jackets: The kid out of Nobleton, Ontario is also supposed to be pretty good. A standout at September's Traverse City prospect tournament, Fantilli appeared NHL-ready in every way, beyond the potting of seven points on 15 shots through two games. Happily launching camp on a top-six line with Patrik Laine (\"yeah, it's going great, obviously, [Laine's] really easy to play with\"), the gifted center is endeavouring to lay a foundation for an outstanding rookie campaign.\nAfter scoring 65 points in 36 games as a freshman with the University of Michigan - and winning the Hobey Baker award - Fantilli should earn regular opportunities to prove he can hang with the grownups. Especially since this Blue Jackets squad is still a year or two away from making serious noise in the East. He's my favorite forward pick in dynasty competition outside of the young fella in Chicago.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever! Set your league size, select your keepers, and invite your friends to start playing. Sign up for free today be the commish!\nMarco Rossi, F, Minnesota Wild: If, and we're talking a mammoth-sized if here, he gets a shot at playing on the Wild's top line, the just-turned 22-year-old could be in for one heck of a first full round in the NHL. Many will argue that, after potting 51 points in 53 games with the AHL Wild in 2022-23, Rossi merits at least a chance to compete between Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello, but he'll have to leapfrog Frederick Gaudreau Joel Eriksson Ek, and Ryan Hartman (when healthy again) to get there. A role in the bottom-six doesn't harbor anywhere near the same fantasy promise.\nKeep a close view on where the ninth-overall draft pick (2020), now three years removed from battling COVID-related myocarditis, lines up in camp.\nMatthew Knies, F, Toronto Maple Leafs: Fellow Arizonan Auston Matthews, after training with the young winger this summer, had this to say, \"He's very driven. Physically, he's more than capable of playing all 82 games and being a really good player for us.\"\nToss in a promising gig on the Leafs' second line alongside center John Tavares, plus a spot on the No. 2 power play, and we might have a fresh productive fantasy force in Toronto this season. Knies potted 21 goals and 21 assists in 40 games with the University of Minnesota before collecting five in 10 with his NHL club, including four in seven postseason contests.\nLogan Cooley, F, Arizona Coyotes: Part of the Coyotes' \"present\", as well as their future, according to coach Andre Tourigny, Cooley is already turning heads in his post-Collegiate career (see below). The advantage of playing for a rebuilding club unencumbered by ambitious expectations at present is that he'll earn plenty of minutes and ripe opportunities to do the same all season long. Why not? If not for Fantilli's exceptional showing, Cooley's 60 points as a freshman with the University of Minnesota may have sufficed in winning him the Hobey Baker. Even the most frustrated Coyotes fan can feel legitimately excited about this raw star. Fantasy managers should too.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nMatt Coronato, F, Calgary Flames: Toss the Harvard lad on the right side of Nazem Kadri (again), and let him strut his scoring stuff, is my advice. With new GM Craig Conroy and bench boss Ryan Huska at the helm, the soon-to-turn 21-year-old should earn a fair shake at the chance to fill one of the Flames' handful of vacancies up front.\nA dynamic scoring winger, Coronato has impressed at every level to date, including with the USHL Chicago Steel and in college competition. His eight points in 10 games at the 2023 IIHF men's World Championships this past May more than proves he can keep up with experienced, fully-grown pros. An obvious top-tier selection in dynasty leagues, the 13th overall draft pick (2021) could make a tangible scoring impact as soon as now.\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nLuke Hughes, D, New Jersey Devils: Long after the novelty of watching him compete on the same team as older brother Jack wears off, the youngest Hughes sibling will still be putting up points with regularity. It's only a matter of time before he supplants, or joins Dougie Hamilton, on the Devils' top power play. An immediate must-grab in keeper play, this fourth-overall draft pick (2021) already sports value in all but the shallowest of conventional re-draft fantasy leagues.\nBrandt Clarke, D, Los Angeles Kings: Having enjoyed the privilege of watching this kid compete for the Barrie Colts in person on a handful of occasions, I can assure you he's something special. A future key piece of the Kings' blue line, and top prospect at large, the 20-year-old has accomplished all he can in the OHL, and feels ready to play full-time with the club that drafted him eighth overall in 2021 (ahead of Arizona's Dylan Guenther, Coronato, and Stars' center Wyatt Johnston).\nBeing in the position to learn from one of the game's best in Drew Doughty certainly won't hurt either. While his most explosive fantasy days lie ahead, Clarke still merits monitoring in the here and now. The young defender scored 61 points in only 31 games with the Colts this past season,\nDevon Levi, G, Buffalo Sabres: As discussed in ESPN.com's fantasy goalie preview, I'm all in on Levi's potential to make the Sabres' roster this season. Maybe not right out of camp, but eventually. And once offered a spot on hockey's largest stage, I do expect him to hold his own. Lack of NHL experience aside, the 21-year-old is bright, skilled, disciplined, hardworking, and confident without seeming concerningly arrogant. A bit small, by goalie standards, but so was Henrik Lundqvist and he managed well enough.\nThis kid's all-around vibe has me convinced he's ready to sub in if/when Eric Comrie or Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen falter or fall hurt. Again, now or later. Adding to this already promising fantasy formula is that Buffalo is already good and only getting better.\nJoseph Woll, G, Toronto Maple Leafs: Unlike Levi in Western New York, Toronto's rookie netminder is expected to make his big-league club out of camp. Serving as a pro since 2019, he can't be sent down to the minors without being subjected to waivers, and fat chance Brad Treliving and Co. take that swing.\nSo, unless injured, he's going to play. More pressing to fantasy managers and Leafs' fans alike, on the assumption that Martin Jones only enters the goaltending mix should Ilya Samsonov or Woll fall hurt, is how well and how much. While seven NHL games hardly count as many, the 25-year-old won over a gazillion Toronto fans by posting a 6-1-0 record, 2.16 GAA, and .932 SV% in 2022-23. Dazzling stuff. One of the league's sneakier sleeper picks between the pipes, with a top-quality club in Toronto, Woll could conduct himself as a game-changer for fantasy managers in 2023-24. He just needs to play.\nSee also:\nTyson Foerster, F, Philadelphia Flyers\nLeo Carlsson, F, Anaheim Ducks\nJoel Hofer, G, St. Louis Blues\nReady to play? Sign up for free today!"}
{"title": "Week 5 takeaways: Revved for Red River, ACC's Notre Dame problem", "date": "2023-10-02 15:03:55", "text": "Quinn Ewers rushes for two touchdowns and throws for another, leading Texas to a big win over Kansas. (1:26)\nWith Week 5 of the college football season in the books, we're seeing some intriguing storylines beyond the Big Two conferences of the SEC and Big Ten.\nThe Red River Rivalry is lined up to be one of the biggest games in the series' recent history, West Virginia has emerged as a surprise in the Big 12 and Louisville is experiencing a resurgence in the ACC. (But can the Cardinals slay Notre Dame?)\nHere's a look at our reporters' key takeaways from this weekend's action.\nThe Longhorns and Sooners are heading to Dallas for a matchup that feels, on paper, more like their legendary early 2000s heavyweight fights.\nIn 2009, No. 3 Texas versus No. 20 Oklahoma rumbled to a 16-13 Longhorns win that then-Texas coach Mack Brown said \"was more like a fight\" a year after Texas' 45-35 victory.\nThis year, following a historic 49-0 blowout of the Sooners, No. 3 Texas faces No. 12 Oklahoma in a matchup that will mark just the third time both teams are at least 5-0 (2008 and 2002).\nLast year, Oklahoma fell to 6-7 after allowing 461 yards and 30 points per game. The Sooners signed seven ESPN 300 defensive recruits, their most since the rankings began in 2006. One of those signees, safety Peyton Bowen, the No. 17 overall player in the class, leads Oklahoma with four passes broken up and has blocked two punts. OU has allowed just 54 points this season, fewest by a Big 12 team over the first five games since ... 2009, when Oklahoma and Nebraska both did it.\nTexas, meanwhile, is 5-0 for the first time since 2009, the last time it won the Big 12. The Longhorns beat No. 24 Kansas by 26 points on Saturday, their largest win in an AP-ranked matchup since 2009 against Oklahoma State.\nThe two offenses had huge days this past weekend. Oklahoma lit up Iowa State with 523 yards, while Texas had 661 yards, its most in a conference game since the Big 12 began in 1996. Oklahoma has scored 50 or more points in three of its first five games of a season for the first time since 2008.\nIt looks like a fitting throwback matchup for the teams' final Big 12 version of their historic rivalry, once again with massive implications: According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor, the winner of the 2023 edition will have better than a 70% chance to reach the College Football Playoff, while the loser will have about a 30% chance. -- Dave Wilson\nSo much for preseason polls and coaching hot seat lists. Neal Brown and West Virginia have deposited both in the rubbish bin with a 4-1 start, capped by an impressive road win on Saturday at TCU. West Virginia was picked last in the Big 12 preseason media poll, a forecast that Brown duly noted, saying in July, \"Looking forward to proving everybody wrong on that front. We won't finish there.\"\nBrown certainly faced pressure to win, and a seemingly daunting September schedule included Penn State, Pitt, Texas Tech and TCU. But many forget that even though last season didn't go well overall, West Virginia swept the Oklahoma schools and beat defending Big 12 champion Baylor. The Mountaineers returned some experienced players, especially on defense. Brown told me last week that he especially likes his defensive front, which includes junior Sean Martin and promising redshirt freshman Tomiwa Durojaiye. WVU's defense has shined during its start, allowing only 19 points per game and 3.3 yards per rush. Although Brown has a background on offense, a unit that has struggled for much of his tenure, he has found ways to generate wins and positive vibes.\nThe Mountaineers get a well-timed open week -- they emerged from the TCU outing fairly banged up -- before facing struggling Houston and Oklahoma State. They miss Texas on the schedule, so a solid bounce-back season and some stability for Brown seem well within reach. -- Adam Rittenberg\nFor the first time, Kentucky and Louisville are both 5-0 to start the season. (No, we're not talking hoops.) Both teams are also about to get a much better test of how good they really are.\nKentucky, coming off a 33-14 beatdown of Florida on Saturday at home, will travel to No. 1 Georgia. Louisville, which slipped past host NC State 13-10 on Friday, will return home to face Notre Dame.\nThe Kentucky program is as healthy as it's been under Mark Stoops, who is in his 11th season. Winning three in a row over Florida would have sounded like a fairy tale during the Wildcats' 31-game losing streak in the series from 1987 to 2007. But Stoops has stayed the course, made adjustments (such as getting Liam Coen back as offensive coordinator and plugging in key transfers such as QB Devin Leary, RB Ray Davis, WR Tayvion Robinson, OT Marques Cox, S Zion Childress and PK Alex Raynor) and maintained a tough, blue-collar approach that has served this team well. The Wildcats are averaging 6.5 yards per rush and holding their opponents to only 2.5 yards per rush.\nThe Cardinals, in Jeff Brohm's first season back at his alma mater, are 3-0 in conference play for the first time as an ACC member. They've teetered at times against their Power 5 opponents and squeaked past NC State thanks to a 53-yard field goal by Brock Travelstead in the final six minutes. But they've also found different ways to win. Louisville averaged 237 rushing yards in its first four games, but with the running game stuffed last week, it leaned on its defense. The Cardinals held the Wolfpack scoreless in the second half and forced two turnovers.\nLouisville has only two road games remaining on its schedule. Kentucky has four road dates left, including three of its last four contests. It's a stretch to think either of these teams is going to contend for a playoff berth, but their season-ending clash on Nov. 25 could be the most anticipated in years, with the winner potentially having a chance to win nine-plus games. -- Chris Low\nSpeaking of Louisville, the Cardinals have a chance to do something no other ACC team has done in the regular season since Miami in 2017: Beat Notre Dame.\nDuke was two minutes away from doing it Saturday night. Its defense then gave up two big plays on the final drive, Notre Dame scored the winning touchdown with 31 seconds left and a long winning streak was extended. The Fighting Irish have won 30 straight regular-season ACC games, passing Florida State (1992 to 1995) for the longest such streak.\nNotre Dame takes a lead on Audric Estime's 30-yard touchdown against Duke with 31 seconds left.\nThere are two key differences here: (1) Nobody will ever confuse the Notre Dame teams of the past five years with those dominant Florida State teams (no offense Irish, these are just facts) and (2) unlike Florida State, Notre Dame is not actually an ACC member in football, which is the biggest gut punch of all for the league.\nThe ACC literally asked for this when the Irish joined the league for the 2013-14 season in all sports but football and men's hockey. A football scheduling partnership -- in which Notre Dame would play five or six ACC teams annually -- seemed like a win-win decision at the time. Notre Dame would get help filling out its schedule; the ACC would get help by boosting its nonconference scheduling and creating more attractive matchups for TV.\nBut this has been a losing proposition in recent years. Though Clemson did defeat Notre Dame in the 2020 ACC championship game and has previously beaten the Irish both in the regular season and the College Football Playoff, nobody else has had close to the same success. That speaks more to the state out of the league outside Clemson, as the ACC works to enhance its football teams.\nThis year has been a much better start, with six undefeated teams through the first four weeks. But even undefeated Duke could not get the job done. Undefeated Louisville is up next. The rest of Notre Dame's ACC schedule for this season? Pitt, at Clemson and Wake Forest. Someone in the ACC has to find a way to step up and end the streak once and for all, for the good of the conference. -- Andrea Adelson\nWith the Pac-12 home to four of the top six offenses nationally (Washington, Oregon, USC and Washington State), Utah knew its quest for a three-peat would be a daunting one. Friday's performance at Oregon State, where Utah couldn't crack 200 total yards in a 21-7 loss, only strengthens the fact that the Utes need Cameron Rising back fast.\nUtah's offense ranks last in the conference (297.6 yards per game), and Rising would provide some much-needed stability to a unit that went five straight quarters without scoring prior to tight end Thomas Yassmin's TD reception in the fourth against the Beavers. The schedule is about to get amped up to another gear, with two of Utah's next three games following a bye week coming against USC and Oregon. If Rising (18-7 career record with 45 touchdown passes) can make his 2023 season debut on Oct. 14 against California and get his feet wet for the stretch run, the Utes' quest to keep the Pac-12 title in Salt Lake City for another year will receive a serious boost. -- Blake Baumgartner\nIn a decisive win over Mississippi State, quarterback Jalen Milroe was efficient, the Crimson Tide got its running game going and the defense had four sacks. This is all a positive push toward Alabama reasserting itself on the national stage, but as coach Nick Saban said after the game, the team isn't where it wants to be or needs to be.\nMilroe throws a nice deep ball, but nobody is going to mistake him for the nation's most prolific passer -- especially when he only threw it 12 times on Saturday. If this is Bama's identity, though, then embrace it and continue to make it better. No two-loss team has been to the CFP, which makes this Saturday's game between Alabama and Texas A&M critical. They each have a nonconference loss and are squarely in the mix to win the SEC West. The winner will have a huge edge. -- Heather Dinich"}

{"title": "MMA storylines to watch for the rest of 2023: Rematches galore, vacant titles aplenty", "date": "2023-10-02 15:32:04", "text": "The final quarter of the year is upon us. Things have been hectic -- and newsworthy -- in MMA in 2023.\nFrom a business perspective, the UFC has merged with WWE to form the publicly traded company TKO, under Endeavor. In the cage, UFC titles have been veritable hot potatoes. There have been 10 title changes in the promotion this year, if you include fighters vacating belts because of retirement or injury.\nThe UFC has three more pay-per-view cards before the year ends, and at least five titles will be on the line. Bellator 300 is a few days away, on Saturday in San Diego, with four title fights. PFL still has to decide its entire slate of 2023 championships in November.\nWhat should fans watch over the next three months before the ball drops, sending us into 2024? ESPN MMA insiders Marc Raimondi, Brett Okamoto, Jeff Wagenheim, Andres Waters and Myron Medcalf glance at the top storylines for the rest of the year.\nTom Aspinall finishes Marcin Tybura within the first 90 seconds of the first round of the main event.\nThe UFC 295 main event on Nov. 11 is one of the biggest heavyweight title fights ever. In terms of pure achievements, it's the biggest. Jon Jones is the longtime former UFC light heavyweight champion and a man who is unbeaten in 18 straight fights. Dial that back even more: Jones has never truly been beaten -- his only loss came via questionable disqualification. Stipe Miocic, the challenger in New York, is a two-time former UFC heavyweight champion with a record four total title defenses. His three straight title defenses are also a UFC heavyweight record.\nAs if that isn't significant enough -- the light heavyweight GOAT against the heavyweight GOAT -- what happens after the fight is completely in question. Miocic is 41 years old and a full-time firefighter, and this will be his first fight since March 2021. There's a solid chance that, win or lose, Miocic will retire after UFC 295. Miocic told me in an interview last week that it was a possibility, but only because he's thought about retirement after every one of his fights, going back to his first UFC bout. We'll see.\nMeanwhile, Jones has said on several occasions that this could be it for him. Whether that's a negotiating ploy is up for debate. But Jones is 36 years old. He won his first UFC title when he was 23, the youngest to do it. There is nothing Jones has accomplished. His legacy as the greatest MMA fighter is all but set. Even beating Miocic would just be gravy -- another on a list of Jones accomplishments that could barely fit on one of those lengthy drugstore receipts.\nSo, what would heavyweight look like without Jones and Miocic? The two names that immediately come to mind are Tom Aspinall and Sergei Pavlovich. The former is a well-rounded Brit who can finish a fight anywhere. Aspinall is on the verge of being a big star in the United Kingdom and beyond. The latter is a hard-hitting Russian, a modern-day Drago with size and enormous power. Aspinall and Pavlovich seem to be on a collision course, regardless of the result of UFC 295. Whether that's a title eliminator or a flat-out title fight will be determined on Nov. 11. The heavyweight division will be in good hands with them, but it would be cool to see one get a shot at a Jones or Miocic in a potential passing-the-torch fight.\nI'm curious how the UFC handles these potential rematches. Rematches can be good for the sport and draw a lot of attention. Any time you have a rematch, you have a built-in storyline. But how many will the UFC sign up for? It can't be a year of rematches.\nAnd if you look at each division, it's rematches galore right now. Alexa Grasso vs. Valentina Shevchenko, trilogy. Sean Strickland vs. Israel Adesanya, rematch. Islam Makhachev vs. Charles Oliveira, rematch. Alexander Volkanovski vs. just about any featherweight after Ilia Topuria, rematch. Volkanovski vs. Makhachev, rematch. Sean O'Malley vs. Marlon Vera, rematch. Alexandre Pantoja vs. Brandon Royval, rematch. Pantoja vs. Brandon Moreno, tetralogy.\nThere are some great fights in there, for sure. But does the sport need a year in which nearly half of the major UFC pay-per-view events are matchups we've already seen? Depending on what happens in some of these divisions, we could be looking at more potential rematch situations. Leon Edwards vs. Kamaru Usman 3? Colby Covington vs. Usman 3? Volkanovski vs. Holloway 4? As Dana White likes to say, we'll see how things play out -- but I could see a scenario in which we are debating the merit of plenty of rematches during the next 12 months.\nEarlier this year, Bellator announced that it would be launching a men's flyweight division with former bantamweight champion Kyoji Horiguchi taking on Rizin's Makoto Takahashi for the new title at Bellator MMA vs. Rizin 2 on July 29. But that didn't go as planned -- just seconds into the match, an accidental eye poke by Horiguchi forced the fight to be ruled a no contest, leaving Bellator without a champion for its new division on its inaugural night.\nThere are plenty of questions surrounding the division, but two questions are the most important. The first is obvious: Will there be a rematch for the 125-pound title? Since that fight, the promotion hasn't announced any plans to run it back. Second, and most importantly, who's on the men's flyweight roster? Despite having a fight for the title, Bellator has yet to say anything regarding the fighters it has picked up to fill out this division. It's not an ideal way to introduce a new weight class. Hopefully, we can get some answers sooner rather than later.\nAmanda Nunes leaves her belts and gloves in the Octagon after announcing her retirement from fighting at UFC 289.\nThe UFC women's featherweight and bantamweight divisions have been without a champion ever since Amanda Nunes retired at UFC 289 in June. A month later, Jamahal Hill announced he was vacating the light heavyweight title after rupturing his Achilles tendon. So now 25% of the weight classes in the sport's leading promotion have vacancies at the top.\nThe vacancies themselves are not what's concerning. Retirements and, sadly, career-interrupting injuries happen. What matters here is the UFC's urgency -- or lack of urgency -- in filling those essential positions.\nThe bean counters at the UFC no doubt are more concerned with sorting out the Conor McGregor soap opera, because a \"Notorious\" return would get a standing ovation from TKO stockholders. But fans deserve better. As fun as it used to be to watch McGregor fight, hasn't the circus surrounding him grown tiresome? Every time McGregor rolls into town, it distracts the sport from what matters: the quest to be the best.\nThe UFC is working on it at light heavyweight. Jiří Procházka and Alex Pereira will tangle for the belt at UFC 295 in a tantalizing clash of former champions -- Procházka at light heavy, Pereira at middleweight -- who are standup standouts of very different styles. There's nothing on the books, however, for reestablishing supremacy at women's bantamweight and featherweight.\nLet's get those divisions topped before the end of the year. There's no need to wait for a matchup as brilliant as Procházka vs. Pereira to emerge. The next Amanda Nunes is not out there. But the UFC's 135- and 145-pound women need someone to chase, and fans deserve more shiny belts to follow.\nAlexa Grasso retains her flyweight title after a split draw with former flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\nFor years, Shevchenko owned the women's flyweight division. At 125 pounds, she had been the mayor, the sheriff and the deputy, as she defended her belt seven times in a row. Then she faced Grasso, the current champion who upset Shevchenko earlier this year and then kept the belt via a controversial draw last month. Grasso's emergence has not only changed the division, but the titleholder and her colleagues could also change the UFC.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Passan predicts the MLB playoffs »\n• Connelly's September CFB truths »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nThe 125-pound women's landscape is no longer dominated by one fighter. Grasso and Shevchenko will eventually meet a third time -- once Shevchenko heals from a hand injury -- but she's not the only threat to Grasso's throne. Erin Blanchfield hasn't lost since February 2019. The jiu-jitsu specialist has four submissions in that run. Who wants to fight her? Manon Fiorot toyed with Rose Namajunas, the former strawweight champ, when they met in September. Fiorot has won her last 11 fights. Who wants to fight her? And a Maycee Barber-Grasso rematch -- Grasso beat Barber via unanimous decision in 2021, Barber's most recent loss -- also makes sense. Plus, Jessica Andrade is always a handful at 115 or 125 pounds.\nThere are enough fights to turn 125 pounds into the UFC's most competitive and fascinating division in the years ahead, especially with the possibility of a few 115-pound fighters moving up. There has always been talk about Zhang Weili potentially chasing a second belt at 125 pounds. But the return of Tatiana Suarez -- the undefeated fighter who beat Andrade at 115 pounds in August, her second bout after a four-year layoff -- makes things interesting for two divisions. Suarez has fought at 125 pounds, and she's a serious contender in both weight classes. Who wants to fight her?\nAnd that's the beauty of the UFC. For years, we just wondered whom Shevchenko would dismiss next. Now, the months and years ahead could feature a gauntlet in the women's flyweight division that boosts the entire UFC."}

Blaney in his Ford for Team Penske and Harvick in a Ford for Stewart-Haas Racing finished essentially in a drag race with both drivers refusing to lift as a crash broke out behind them.\n\"I've won it by more than I have the last couple years. That one might have been by 4 feet, the others were by 2 but you just don't know,\" said Blaney, a three-time winner at Talladega. \"You just kind of drag race a line and hope you get help.\"\nBlaney joined William Byron as the two drivers locked into the round of eight. The field of 12 will be pared next Sunday to eight following the race on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nBlaney boss Roger Penske praised the strategy of the Ford camp to work together to ensure a Ford victory as the Chevrolets from Hendrick Motorsports were making a quick challenge.\n\"For Harvick, who it was his last race here, working like he did with Ryan, it was amazing to see that,\" said Penske. \"The Hendrick freight train was coming and we all stayed together, that was the call that Ford had earlier in the day when we talked. It was just perfect execution.\"\nFord has won 10 playoff races at Talladega, most at any track, and Team Penske has won 10 of the last 18 races at the 2.66-mile Alabama oval.\nBlaney, winner of the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte in May, now has multiple wins in a season for the second time in his career. But he's got a lopsided stat this season in that he has only five top-five finishes, but two wins.\n\"It was a pretty wild restart, let alone the last couple of laps, losing momentum and getting it back, just getting clear to the bottom to get to the front row and drag race it out with Kevin,\" said Blaney. \"To win here three times at Talladega is super cool.\"\nHarvick finished second as his winless streak stretched to 43 races dating back to last season. NASCAR said nearly two hours after the race that his Ford had been disqualified because the fasteners on his windshield were not secure.\nThe Harvick disqualification dropped him to last in the field. Byron in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports moved up to second and Denny Hamlin, who rallied from a lap down, moved up to third in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing.\nHamlin led three laps during the second stage but was flagged for speeding on pit road -- a troubling habit of the three-time Daytona 500 winner considered the best driver to never win a Cup championship -- and the penalty contributed to him falling a lap off the pace. It was Hamlin's fourth speeding penalty of the season and it took him most of the race to earn his position back on the lead lap and then drove through the field to secure his finish.\n\"Not how we drew it up, but a dub is a dub and that was a dub in our book -- it's as close as it gets to it,\" Hamlin said. \"A top-five is a long way from where we were with about 15 laps to go.\"\nCorey LaJoie, who is not in the playoffs, moved up to fourth in a Chevrolet for Spire Motorsports. Blaney teammate Austin Cindric moved to fifth and was followed by Justin Haley of Kaulig Racing in a Chevrolet, defending race winner Chase Elliott for Hendrick, and the Fords of Ryan Preece and Riley Herbst. Daniel Suarez moved up to 10th. None of the drivers who finished fourth through 10th are in the playoffs.\nThe race had 70 lead changes among 24 drivers and was fairly clean. Ross Chastain was in an early crash that caused last year's championship runner-up to finish last. Brad Keselowski was in a later crash with 28 laps to go that ended the race for him, caused damage to Talladega's outer wall and stopped all action under a red flag.\nPLAYOFF PICTURE\nEven though he crashed and finished 32nd, Keselowski remained two points above the cutline headed to Charlotte's elimination race.\nThe four drivers in jeopardy of elimination are Tyler Reddick of 23XI Racing, Chastain of Trackhouse Racing, Bubba Wallace of 23XI and Kyle Busch of Richard Childress Racing. Busch must win to advance.\nWallace had a lengthy post-race chat with 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan on pit road following his 23rd-place finish. Jordan appeared to be encouraging him, at one point placing his hand on the back of Wallace's neck and then shoulder, then pulling him in for a hug.\nCHASTAIN CRASHES OUT\nChastain, who finished second to Joey Logano last year in the championship race, finished one spot ahead of Harvick after a collision with fellow title contenders Busch and Christopher Bell on the final lap of the first stage.\nChastain entered Talladega, the middle race of the round of 12, ranked sixth in the Cup standings and 12 points above the cutline. His last-place finish dropped him below the cutline and forced him into a high-pressure situation next week on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nChastain has struggled in his four previous starts on Charlotte's hybrid road course/oval track. His best finish is 22nd.\n\"Left and right,\" he said when asked how he expects next week to go. \"I'm living my dream, so whatever our team brings next week, we'll put our best foot forward. As long as I'm getting to drive these rocket ships that Trackhouse brings me, I'm living my dream and we'll keep fighting.\"\nUP NEXT\nNASCAR races next Sunday on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where Bell won last year to avoid playoff elimination."}

{"title": "Down but not out: Jermell Charlo couldn't top Canelo Alvarez, but still has meaningful fights ahead", "date": "2023-10-02 19:25:12", "text": "Canelo Alvarez handles business with another big-time win, this time over challenger Jermell Charlo in Las Vegas. (1:47)\nLAS VEGAS -- Jermell Charlo was ringside at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in November 2021 when Canelo Alvarez faced Caleb Plant for the undisputed super middleweight championship.\nDuring the fight -- which Canelo won via 11th-round TKO -- Charlo turned to his twin brother, Jermall, and said: \"I can beat Canelo.\"\nTurns out, it's one thing to say it. It's quite another to actually do it.\nCharlo (35-2-1, 19 KOs) jumped two weight classes on Saturday in an attempt to dethrone boxing's top star, but he was no match. Alvarez won virtually every second of the fight, scored a seventh-round knockdown and earned a unanimous-decision victory to retain his four titles at 168 pounds.\nThere's no shame, of course, in losing to an all-time great like Canelo. Charlo was nearly a 4-1 underdog to upset Alvarez for many reasons.\nCharlo struggled in a loss to Tony Harrison in 2018 and a draw with Brian Castano in 2021, quality boxers who are levels below Alvarez. Charlo finished both Harrison (2019) and Castano (2022) inside the distance in rematches, which spoke well of his ability to make adjustments. But there didn't seem to be a Plan B on Saturday and he oddly seemed content after the bout to have lasted until the final bell.\n\"I'm proud of myself,\" said Charlo, who fights out of Houston. \"He didn't knock me out; he knocked all the other guys out.\"\nCharlo predicted the fight would last the 12-round distance and apparently found a moral victory in not being another Alvarez KO victim. It's a strange approach for one of the sport's most outspoken fighters.\nAfter the fight, Alvarez felt that Charlo wasn't trying to win the fight.\n\"I think that happens with a lot of fighters,\" Alvarez said. \"That's not on my mind, to survive that way. So then I did my job. I think he never [did] something to win.\"\nAs Alvarez piled up rounds, trainer Derrick James implored Charlo to be more aggressive down the stretch. But Charlo never pushed, never landed a punch of consequence and never threatened to be competitive let alone win the fight.\n\"My head is held high,\" said Charlo, who acknowledged he could have been more aggressive. \"I am proud of myself.\"\nFollowing Charlo's lackluster performance on Saturday, pound-for-pound king Terence Crawford, who was ringside to watch the fight, had some choice words for his potential future opponent.\n\"You went out sad,\" Crawford immediately posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, while tagging Charlo. \"Didn't even try to win, all you did was try to survive. You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\"I'm over Charlo, he's no longer on my hit list,\" Crawford added. \"He went out there and laid down.\"\nCharlo said \"Crawford could be on the radar,\" but it appears the feeling is no longer mutual. And if the matchup did materialize, it certainly lost a lot of luster.\nBut all is not lost for Charlo. He didn't seem to take much damage outside of the seventh-round knockdown courtesy of a Canelo overhand right and should be an improved fighter going forward after sharing the ring for 12 rounds with Alvarez.\nCharlo still has other meaningful fights in his future. After all, he remains the top guy at 154 pounds. Charlo said he only rehydrated to around 172, 173 pounds on fight night; boxers routinely gain 10-15 pounds overnight.\n\"I'm going back down to 154 so that's gonna be major,\" Charlo said. \"I can do it. I can make the weight easy.... I'm used to moving around much lighter.\"\nHowever, he's no longer the undisputed junior middleweight champion. Charlo still holds the WBA, WBC and IBF titles. But once the bell rang on Saturday, the WBO stripped Charlo and elevated Australian star Tim Tszyu from interim champion to full champion.\n\"Tim Tszyu is the [WBO junior middleweight] champion,\" WBO president Francisco \"Paco\" Valcarcel told ESPN on Monday. \"[The fight between] Tim Tszyu with [Brian] Mendoza is for the title. [Jermell] Charlo was notified when we posted the resolution online [August 3].\"\nThat resolution indicated that once Charlo got in the ring to face Canelo, instead of his mandatory challenger, Tim Tszyu, Charlo would be stripped of the belt and Tszyu \"will be automatically elevated from interim champion to full champion status.\"\n\"I would like to talk with somebody from the WBO and see what kind of issues they can resolve...,\" Charlo said. \"I gotta just continue to roll with the punches. Jermell Charlo never gets the fair end of the stick. I gotta go and fight for mine....\n\"[The WBO] must really got a relationship with the people in Australia. And that's okay with me. I just gotta continue to be a champion and continue to fight, and barnone put my heart on the line every time I get in there.\"\nOne of the opportunities to put that performance in the past will be, perhaps, a rescheduled showdown with Tszyu, who's impressed with his power and improved attack in recent fights.\nTszyu, 28, will make the first defense of his WBO title on Oct. 14 in Sydney against Brian Mendoza. The son of Hall of Famer Kostya Tszyu, Tim Tszyu was set to fight Charlo in January before Charlo broke his left hand in two places during a sparring session just a month before the scheduled bout.\nThis was his first fight since his hand was placed in a cast in January, and it was also his first time fighting a truly elite opponent. He had never fought above 154 pounds and despite being taller than Canelo, was the naturally smaller man.\nAlvarez himself said he wasn't 100% confident in his surgically repaired left wrist when he fought John Ryder in May. So it's unfair to believe that Charlo was at his best on Saturday.\nMost of all, perhaps, Charlo was contending with serious ring rust -- 16 months. His most-recent fight was in May 2022, an impressive 10th-round KO of Castano. Beginning with 2020, Charlo has fought only once a year. During that same span, Alvarez competed seven times.\nThree top fighters recently suffered defeats after long layoffs. Josh Taylor (16 months, UD loss) against Teofimo Lopez Jr., Stephen Fulton (13 months, KO8) vs. Naoya Inoue, and Errol Spence Jr. (15 months, KO9) to Crawford.\nIf Charlo can compete at least twice in 2024 and return to winning ways at 154 pounds against a fighter like Tszyu, he could still obtain the pound-for-pound recognition he so desperately seeks.\n\"I think I'm the best fighter in the world,\" Charlo said. \"I still think that right now.\""}
{"title": "Euro women's weekend review: WSL returns in style, Man United win late, Lyon down PSG", "date": "2023-10-02 20:28:19", "text": "Nedum Onuoha reacts to Arsenal breaking the WSL attendance record in their clash with Liverpool in the opening weekend of the competition. (1:52)\nAfter a summer off for good behaviour, the Women's Super League (WSL) returned on Sunday with an entertaining a day filled with goals, cards and debuts. These are the key talking points from the WSL weekend, along with some highlights from European action.\nWith WSL referees encouraged to mirror the men's game and clamp down on things like dissent and time-wasting, we saw an influx in cautions over the weekend, with an increased willingness from officials to go to their pockets for the type of fouls that have historically been overlooked in the women's game.\nIndeed, across the six games, 17 yellow cards were handed out for a variety of offences including dissent, with Aston Villa's Lucy Parker the first player to be booked this season in a match that saw six yellow cards in total issued by ref Rebecca Welch. It was a notable day in WSL that also saw two straight red cards -- for Aston Villa's Kirsty Hanson and Manchester City's Leila Ouahabi -- which hasn't happened in the league for over a decade.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nAs well as the increase in cautions, just as there was at the Women's World Cup this summer, there was ample time added on at the end of each half following new guidelines for stoppages in play, meaning some teams played well over 100 minutes of football.\nOn the topic of increased added time, particularly at the end of the second half, there was late drama at Villa Park when Manchester United claimed all three points with a stoppage-time winner from Rachel Williams. After Villa's Hanson was dismissed for a high tackle on Hayley Ladd, the hosts took a shock 1-0 lead via Rachel Daly's low shot. But Lucía García had United level within minutes, converting from a corner and setting the scene for Williams' dramatic late header from Nikita Parris' cross.\nThe Red Devils are clearly picking up where they left off from last year with their late, often game-changing, goals. Those heroics were absent for their rivals, however, with Everton (who lost 2-1 at home), Tottenham (who fell 2-1) and Arsenal (1-0 losers) all unable to find similar late goals against Brighton, Chelsea and Liverpool respectively.\nWith almost every WSL team having strengthened over the summer in hopes of bridging some of the gaps and creating a bit more parity, there was a glut of goals across the day's fixtures as well.\nOnly Manchester City (in a 2-0 win at West Ham) and Liverpool (1-0 winners at Arsenal) managed to keep their clean sheets on Sunday afternoon, thanks to the improved attacking across the league. Daly, last season's golden boot winner scored the first WSL of the campaign when she got the better of Man United keeper Mary Earps. And both Spurs and Leicester -- two teams who struggled for goals last campaign -- would have been relieved to see their new recruits finding the back of the net bag on what was, a memorable day for new signings.\nMartha Thomas scored for Tottenham in a losing effort, while Jill Roord opened the scoring for Man City in their win, but Foxes' boss Willie Kirk will probably be happiest about his new players: three of his summer recruits, Aimee Palmer, Lena Petermann and Jutta Rantala scored all the goals on their Leicester City debuts in a 4-2 win at Bristol City.\nOn the topic of new faces, it was a Sunday to remember as so many of the players signed over the summer came up big for their new clubs.\nThe tone was set in the first game of the afternoon. Geyse picked up where she left off at Barcelona by straight balling out for Manchester United, running at defences and causing panic among Villa defenders who were struggling to contain her. But it wasn't just the Brazilian international who starred at Villa Park: the Villanesses' new No.1, Dutch international Daphne van Domselaar, made a string of eye-catching saves to keep the visitors frustrated until their late breakthrough.\nIn the West Country, Rantala stole the show for the Foxes after coming on at half-time for the visitors. The Finnish international was instrumental in Leicester's strong second-half showing, scoring four minutes after the restart and adding a second seven minutes from time among a flurry of strong debuts across both teams.\nThe beautiful game lives here.

However, it wasn't just about the goalscorers, as Spurs winger Olga Ahtinen and Chelsea midfielder Sjoeke Nüsken turned in strong WSL debuts as well.\nIt was a similar story in North London, where Liverpool's savvy showing in a 1-0 win was punctuated with key performances from newcomers Miri Taylor (who grabbed the game's only goal) and Austrian midfielder Marie Höbinger, though Arsenal's summer signings were left looking to the next game to impress. The bigger delight, though, was the record WSL crowd in attendance for the Gunners' opener, as 54,115 turned up for Sunday's clash, only for the visitors to take the three points.\nAcross London, Roord put in a vintage performance for Manchester City on her return to the Super League, scoring City's second in a dominant performance against the Irons.\nLikely to be key to the Seagulls in their quest for a top-half finish, Brighton's debuting duo of Vicky Losada and Pauline Bremer both impressed, even if the plaudits went to regulars Elisabeth Terland and Katie Robinson.\nUsually left for later in the first cycle of fixtures, champions Lyon had their first clash with familiar foes, Paris Saint-Germain, on Sunday evening. Having handed a debut to new star striker Tabitha Chawinga, the Parisiennes enjoyed their spell of chances early in the game before Lyon found a gear with which to exploit their opponents, running out 1-0 winners thanks to Eugénie Le Sommer's 20th-minute strike.\nIn Germany, Wolfsburg were put through their paces at the Waldstadion, twice having to come from behind against Eintracht before stamping their dominance on the match thanks in no small part to stunning strikes from Lena Oberdorf and Joelle Wedemeyer. The 4-2 win leaves Wolfsburg in an advantageous position early in the season after champions Bayern had dropped points in their first outing, a 2-2 result vs. Freiburg.\nMeanwhile, in Liga F, Spanish juggernauts Barcelona were put through their paces against a resilient Huelva team, which affirmed the closing margins across the women's football landscape. It took a 92nd minute own goal from Ana Carol to secure Barca's win, though an even later finish by Laia Ballesté made things a little nervous."}

(2:20)\nWe say it every year -- typically, rookies aren't drafted until the middle to late rounds in fantasy basketball.\nYes, every now and then, there's a hyped up player who sneaks into round three (like this year), but most seasons the top rookie won't go until the fourth or fifth round at the earliest.\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThis presents a major opportunity for the savvy fantasy manager, who dedicates the early rounds to setting up the foundation of their team while having a certain rookie or two in mind for the middle and late rounds. Find the right rookies, and this can be a winning formula.\nBut who are the rookies to have this season? And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ½ inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}
{"title": "Six players ready to make a big leap in Year 2", "date": "2023-10-02 21:43:05", "text": "After a stellar rookie season, Trail Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe should see plenty of opportunity in a new-look Portland backcourt. (1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind. With the majority of drafted players entering the NBA in their late teens or very early 20s, and many of those players international, the development process from prospect to professional can extend beyond a single season. .\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball.\nAs you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}

The club was clearly aware of their bumbling ways because they cleaned house in 2021. Chris Albright came over to head up soccer operations and they've barely made a wrong move since.\nWhether it's bringing in players from abroad, plucking players from elsewhere in the league, developing those on the roster or deploying their squad in a smart, cohesive system, Cincy have emerged as the class of MLS. Everyone, from Albright, down to manager Pat Noonan, to presumptive league MVP Luciano Acosta, has been nothing short of outstanding and on Saturday they won the Supporters' Shield to show for all their terrific work.\nTwo years ago, Cincy were holding the Wooden Spoon after losing 12 straight to end the season. Now, they are the class of the league and have the first piece of silverware for their trophy case. But what about the 28 teams behind them? Let's rank 'em.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nPrevious ranking: 1\nCincy's superpower is not that they blow teams out of the water. It's that week in, week out, they put together competent performances and rack up points with their consistency. So was it ideal that they got locked into a pretty close game with Toronto? No, but Cincy were the better team and won like they have so often this season. And it is why they are unquestionably deserving Supporters' Shield winners.\nTHE SHIELD IS OURS! pic.twitter.com/84RE1OpkZ4\nPrevious ranking: 2\nThe Crew would have celebrated an impressive win over Philly, but Andre Blake would not give. Those two points lost could be the difference between home-field advantage and not come playoff time.\nPrevious ranking: 4\nThe last time Orlando lost at home was way back on April 22, so it's no surprise they cruised past Montréal at Exploria Stadium. They could clinch that awfully effective home-field advantage for the playoffs as soon as next week.\nPrevious ranking: 3\nThe Union continue to display their depth and adaptiveness. Draws against Dallas and Columbus under heavy rotation were impressive, but they also failed to display the truly excellent top form that has been fleeting this season. If they're going to upend the teams above them in a stacked East, they need to find that extra gear.\nPrevious ranking: 7\nKings of Missouri? Check. Kings of the West? Check. It was a dream week for City, who beat SKC to clinch the top seed in the West, continuing an expansion season beyond anyone's wildest dreams.\nPrevious ranking: 5\nThe return of Sam Surridge was supposed to jumpstart the Nashville attack, but they could barely get him the ball in a scoreless draw with Seattle. The Coyotes have four more chances to put their newly healthy pieces together ahead of the playoffs when they will need a better attack if they want a chance to make a run in a very strong conference. The talent is certainly there, it's just about finding the right form before time runs out.\nPrevious ranking: 6\nLosing the Campeones Cup on penalties was rough, but having Chicho Arango come back to LA in an RSL kit and beat you? That not only stings, but it has them in real danger of losing home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.\nPrevious ranking: 8\nThe Five Stripes got to take the week off and watch teams around them drop points. A leap into the top four of the East and an extra game or two in Atlanta is still in play.\nPrevious ranking: 10\nIt's hardly novel to say that the Sounders desperately need Raúl Ruidíaz at his best to make some hay in the West. That was clear once more after the Peruvian was ruled out of their 0-0 draw with Nashville, but there's still a few weeks left for the 33-year-old to get right for one last playoff run.\nPrevious ranking: 14\nChicho Arango's game-winner in his return to LAFC was the fun story from the big RSL win, but it was Rubio Rubin who made the goal happen with his gorgeous cross. Pablo Mastroeni's team continues to get the job done away from home.\nPrevious ranking: 10\nInter drew NYCFC to make it three results from four matches without Lionel Messi (and they won another when he played sparingly) in a massive statement to those who claim this team is nothing without the Argentine. Unfortunately, their playoff odds keep growing longer so we may have to wait until next season to see the new Inter Miami get a real crack at the league.\nPrevious ranking: 11\nA quick glance at the score would lead you to believe that the Dynamo went a little too hard after winning the U.S. Open Cup and were a little flat against Dallas, but Houston played well and were unlucky not to beat their Texas rivals. Ben Olsen's team is still trending up at the right time.\nPrevious ranking: 13\nThe Revs fans showed up big time to the tune of 37,701 and the team repaid them with a win over Charlotte. Exactly how good this team is now, and will be in the playoffs, remains to be seen after such a volatile summer, but they still own the third seed in the East.\nPrevious ranking: 12\nThe Caps' midweek draw in Colorado doesn't look great at face, but it capped off a seven-match road trip with 11 points so it wasn't too bad. Losing two leads and taking just a point from D.C. at home is tougher to spin as a positive, especially with St. Louis, LAFC and Seattle on tap to close out the season.\nPrevious ranking: 15\nFCD did well to take results from Vancouver and Houston, but after those pair of draws they are now asking themselves an eternal soccer question: is it impressive that a team is managing to so regularly avoid defeat, or concerning that they are struggling to win?

(2:34)\nLONDON -- There was a point on Monday, as a Dominos pizza truck parked up next to Craven Cottage in the build-up to the game, when it became clear Chelsea's woeful form in front of goal was beginning to transform from a persistent narrative to a point of ridicule.\nDominos, in a clear (albeit potentially factual) publicity stunt, had a digital billboard showing how many pizzas they had sold in the five weeks since Chelsea last scored a Premier League goal. It was nearly 10 million and counting. It was humorous -- and for rival fans a bit of schadenfreude -- but more traditional stats about Chelsea's goal drought make for more grim reading.\nComing into Monday's local clash with rivals Fulham, Chelsea had not struck in the league since a 3-0 victory against Premier League strugglers Luton in August, despite the Blues creating chances. Chelsea's five goals were tied for the second-fewest in the Premier League this season (only Burnley had fewer) and their 5.5% shot conversion was the lowest of any team, failing to score with their previous 49 attempts on goal.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Maybe Chelsea have been playing well?\nLike last season under the eventually sacked Graham Potter, Chelsea have remained a team that creates chances but rarely scores. They claimed a narrow 1-0 win over Brighton in the EFL Cup last week. Monday's premier task, then, was to break that deadlock in the Premier League.\nChelsea did that, finally, as part of a much-needed 2-0 victory on Monday that will come as a great relief. Who it came from -- winger Mykhailo Mudryk -- will come as a point of solace, too.\nMudryk arrived at Chelsea as a mark of their enduring appeal last January in a deal that could reach €100 million, but in his ensuing 23 appearances he became the poster boy for the kind of expensive signing that failed to make the grade at Stamford Bridge. Recently, Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino put Mudryk's errors down to confidence and a matter of psychology - an issue he decided to fix by competing against his winger at a game of crossbar challenge.\nWhen pressed in a post-match news conference on why the manager continued to pick Mudryk despite his dry spell, Pochettino said he had earned his chance: \"It is about maturity. It takes time. There was a massive change to the team when he arrived here, and when you arrive to a team it is not easy to settle. When too many young players arrive at a team it is not solid.\"\n\"He showed in his training sessions that he deserved [the chance to play],\" Pochettino added.\nMudryk's moment of redemption came after 18 minutes on Monday. The Ukraine winger flashed a rare look of composure as he chested down a cross from defender Levi Colwill before calmly slotting below Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno for his first goal for Chelsea.\n\"It's all about the design and the strategy that you can provide the young guys, to trust and feel comfortable in themselves, and to feel like home,\" Pochettino said. \"Like everyone, they need to feel like they belong to this club. It's all about [giving them] time and also finding the right people that can help.\"\nIt got even better immediately after the goal. Like the old saying about London buses -- \"You wait for ages and then two come at once\" -- Chelsea scored again seconds later. This time, Cole Palmer pounced on a sloppy pass from Fulham's Tim Ream and slid a pass through to Armando Broja, who just about managed to poke the ball home to complete the quick-fire double. It wasn't as pretty, but it was a goal nonetheless.\n\"For us it's about motivation, even when we were losing and we didn't win at the beginning of the season we were calm and kept the belief,\" Pochettino added. \"Now we have won two games in the last two days, but we always want to keep improving and to build the belief and the confidence because they need to feel that.\"\nMonday's victory does not mark the end of Chelsea's struggles though. There is more work to be done before they can claim to have turned a corner.\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Mudryk, despite his well-taken goal, still did not quite shine on the left and was taken off due to a quad injury at half-time. There should also still be concern over the lack of style and personality needed to produce consistent performances.\nNone of this is to mention the issue of the club's league position. Even after this victory, they're still only in 11th place, a point behind Manchester United, and Chelsea's task will only get tougher.\nChelsea have arguably wasted obvious chances to win points at the start of the season, with away defeats to West Ham and Nottingham Forest, as well as an uninspiring 0-0 draw to Bournemouth. The schedule is about to get much tougher: After a trip to Burnley, Chelsea then face a daunting run of against Arsenal (home), Brentford (home), Tottenham (away) Manchester City (home), Newcastle (away), Brighton (home), Manchester United (away).\n\"In football, you always have to be ready for everything,\" Pochettino said. \"This Saturday [against Burnley] is going to be tough also. It is important for the players to have a lift after two victories, but we will keep working.\"\nAll of those worries can live for another day, though. On Monday, Chelsea broke their deadlock and halted a worrying slide in the league. There can be no ridicule in that."}
{"title": "The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Diaz's offside goal", "date": "2023-10-03 04:30:31", "text": "Dale Johnson explains the sequence of events that led to Luis Diaz's goal being incorrectly disallowed vs. Tottenham. (1:41)\nVideo Assistant Referee causes controversy every week in the Premier League, but how are decisions made, and are they correct?\nAfter each weekend, we take a look at the major incidents, to examine and explain the process both in terms of VAR protocol and the Laws of the Game.\n- How VAR decisions have affected every Prem club in 2023-24\n- VAR in the Premier League: Ultimate guide\nIn this week's VAR Review: What went wrong in the VAR room to disallow Luis Diaz's goal for Liverpool at Tottenham Hotspur, Curtis Jones' red card, a missed penalty award for Brentford and the rest of the weekend's events.\nWhat happened: Mohamed Salah played Luis Díaz through on goal in the 34th minute, and the forward produced a superb strike across goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to score. However, the offside flag immediately went up for offside, and the VAR, Darren England, began a check. (watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal, incorrectly communicated.\nVAR review: How do you get a decision both right and disastrously wrong at the same time? It's a question that refs chief Howard Webb and his leadership team will have to answer in the coming days and take steps to ensure an inexcusable mistake of this magnitude can never happen again. It's the biggest error the Premier League has seen.\nEngland and the assistant VAR, Dan Cook, were swiftly both stood down from duties in fixtures on Sunday and Monday, but that kind of action is of no comfort to Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool players. Both are unlikely to be selected in the upcoming matchweeks.\nThe VAR made one very simple but inexplicable error: He lost concentration and got the on-field decision incorrect when completing the check.\nWhen the VAR looked at the position of Diaz, it quickly became apparent that he was very clearly onside. It was checked with the use of the offside lines in the background -- you see proof of this on the VAR feed when the technology operator zooms in to place them.\nAnd this is where it starts to go wrong. England somehow now thinks he is checking a goal, rather than a disallowed goal (he cannot see the overlay shown on TV and in the stadium). If he was confirming an overturn he would lock in the offside lines, but as he now thinks the on-field decision is \"goal,\" there's no prerequisite to do so when the onside is an obvious one.\nEngland cleared the review so quickly and with such confidence he didn't even get the opinion of the assistant VAR. Perhaps that was the issue, it was such a regulation \"onside\" decision that he thought he would wrap it up. And he said \"check complete.\"\nPerhaps the decision was so straightforward that England lost focus and forgot what the on-field decision actually was, because by saying those two words, he's telling the on-field officials their decision is correct. Rather than clearing the goal, he was mistakenly telling the referee the offside call was correct.\nSemi-automated offside technology, which Premier League clubs chose not to introduce this season, would have made no difference in this situation because the error is the communication with the referee. England correctly identified that Diaz was onside.\nPhil Bentham was brought in from rugby league last season as VAR coach specifically to work on communication. Lessons will need to be learned about the process of \"check complete.\"\nWhat happened next came so fast, there was no time to react within protocol. Just two seconds after the VAR has said \"check complete,\" Spurs took the free kick, which creates a cut-off point. Nothing can be reviewed after a restart. (This doesn't apply to penalties awarded for offences before the half-time or final whistle, as play was still active at the time of the offence.)\nSeven seconds later, the VAR team realised their error. Panic set in, but they decided they couldn't go against protocol so they let play continue. But in this situation, where a very serious mistake has been identified within seconds of the restart, football would rather the VAR went against protocol to achieve the fairest outcome for the game. The match should have been stopped.\nNot only did the VAR team fail to react, but also the management team, which could have stepped in and told the VAR team to roll the game back.\nThere was the opportunity to fix it, and it was missed.\nThe VAR audio of the incident will be released, which will at least provide transparency for what happened.\nErrors in process keep happening, even at the very highest level. At the World Cup last year, France had an injury-time equaliser disallowed against Tunisia when the VAR ruled Antoine Griezmann was offside after the kickoff had been taken.\nAnd only a few weeks ago in the Bundesliga, Heidenheim had a penalty ruled out for offside following a foul by Borussia Dortmund's Sébastien Haller. The officials allowed Haller to be substituted, and during that process the VAR realised the offside decision was incorrect. The penalty was reinstated, but Haller, who should have been sent off for pulling back the striker, was no longer on the pitch. He was only shown a yellow card on the bench instead.\nThat doesn't excuse what happened in the Premier League on Saturday.\nQuestions will be asked about the wisdom of allowing England to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, along with Michael Oliver as a team of English officials, to take charge of a league game between Sharjah and Al Ain. In terms of preparation, it's no different than a game in the Europa League and Europa Conference League; the officials were back from the UAE on Friday lunchtime. But it's the optics of travelling to the Middle East to take up an approved, paid job and then coming back to the Premier League and making a huge mistake.\nWebb has been in charge of referees for only nine months, yet he faces the huge problem of public perception that refereeing is getting worse. The stats from the Independent Key Incidents Panel suggest standards are improving, but catastrophic mistakes like that at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium take a hammer to any progress.\nLiverpool issued a statement on Sunday evening insisting the incident has \"undermined sporting integrity,\" and you can understand their point. But the Laws of the Game specifically state that a mistake in the VAR room is no different from a genuine error on the pitch. France appealed to FIFA to try to get their goal back, but were told they had no grounds. Usually, a game would be replayed only if there was a misapplication of the laws, rather than just an incorrect decision.\nThis will now be tough on England and will take some coming back from. Last season he was shadowed by The Guardian and reference was made to how the official seemed mentally exhausted after awarding a controversial late penalty to Manchester City against Fulham. This is going to be even tougher.\nWhat happened: The game was goalless in the 26th minute when Curtis Jones challenged Yves Bissouma for the ball, and committed a foul. Referee Simon Hooper produced a yellow card, but there was a VAR check for a possible red (watch here.)   \nVAR decision: Yellow card upgraded to red.  \nVAR review: Ex-pros and supporters are always split when a player receives a red card when they have played the ball first, but that doesn't excuse the player for how he may catch an opponent. Jones will no doubt feel himself unlucky to get a red card, but the nature of the challenge always meant a VAR intervention was likely.\nAs explained last week in the review for Malo Gusto's red card for Chelsea against Aston Villa, when the replays show that an opponent's leg has effectively been bent by the tackle, that will be seen as evidence of excessive force.\nJones' foot came off the top of the ball and led to him catching Bissouma high on the shin and forcing his leg backward. It's similar in nature to the dismissal of Manchester United midfielder Casemiro against Southampton last season (though that was a clearer red card due to the way he went into the challenge).\nJones was unlucky, but a VAR intervention for a red card was always likely.\nSome supporters complained that England showed Hooper a freeze frame of the point of contact as he walked over to the pitchside monitor, effectively pre-judging the review. Yet as the monitor is specifically there to confirm an overturn (though the referee retains the right to reject the advice of the VAR), a referee is always going to be shown the clearest evidence to support the decision. Hooper will be told as he walks over the screen exactly what he will see and the kind of replays he will be offered. The referee always has the option of requesting additional angles and replay speeds.\nWhat happened: Brentford had a corner in the final moments of the first half. Nicolás Domínguez jumped for the ball with Vitaly Janelt, and the ball appeared to brush the raised arm of the Forest player as it was nodded on. When the ball bounced inside the area, it was then touched by the hand of Willy Boly.\nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: After the decision to penalise Wolves' João Gomes for his raised arm at Luton Town last weekend, you could understand questions over the first handball by Domínguez. His arm was high, and it was hit by the ball. He escapes because it hit him at point-blank range and the arm position was justified when jumping.\nBoly had his arm by his side, so it would need to be a deliberate handball, and while there was a movement, it appeared to be natural rather than specific to push the ball away.\nWhat happened: Yoane Wissa closed down Forest goalkeeper Matt Turner following a back-pass by Murillo. The Brentford striker got a toe to the ball and pushed it toward goal, and was then caught by Turner as the keeper tried to make the clearance. A defender cleared the ball before it crossed the line.  \nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: This definitely should have been a penalty, and that the error was made by Michael Oliver, who was in the UAE with Darren England, only adds to the issues facing PGMOL this week.\nWissa gets to the ball first and is kicked by the goalkeeper. Perhaps it was Wissa's immediate reaction to get up and play on, rather than appealing for the foul, which threw Oliver. Either way, it was a mistake not to intervene.\nWhat happened: Ollie Watkins doubled Aston Villa's lead in the 21st minute when finishing into the corner. It looked initially as though goalkeeper Jason Steele had let a weak shot past him into the corner of the net, but was he impacted by Nicolò Zaniolo in an offside position in front of him? (watch here)\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\nVAR review: It provides a good comparison with an incident from a month ago, when Manchester City saw a goal allowed to stand when Manuel Akanji was in front of Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno. PGMOL admitted that goal should have been ruled out by the VAR, and on the face of it, this is the same. Then last week Manchester United had a goal ruled out by the VAR when Rasmus Højlund was in front of Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford on Jonny Evans' header. So what's the difference, and why wasn't Villa's goal ruled out?\nThe key difference between Akanji and Zaniolo are the actions of the players in front of the goalkeeper. Akanji made an obvious action to play and/or evade the ball on its way to goal, which had to affect the goalkeeper's decision-making. However, Zaniolo makes absolutely no movement at all -- and this makes any impact on the keeper far more difficult to evaluate.\nThe VAR has decided that he couldn't be certain there was any impact on Steele in the Brighton goal. It's certainly a situation that will split opinion.\nThe disallowed Man United goal was slightly different in interpretation, as Højlund was in direct contact with the Burnley goalkeeper so he had to be considered to be having an impact.\nWe can also look at Crystal Palace's goal at Old Trafford on Saturday. Although there were two players in an offside position in front of goal, they were not impacting André Onana.\nWhat happened: Villa got a third goal in the 26th minute when Pervis Estupiñán diverted a shot from Moussa Diaby into his own net. However, Solly March was adamant he was fouled in the buildup to the goal, which was checked by the VAR (watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal stands. \nVAR review: There's no doubt that March was fouled by Douglas Luiz, who effectively fell into the Brighton player and brought him down. That means the only judgement for the VAR is on the attacking phase: Did the incident happen too far back in the move for it have a material impact?\nIt's a tough call, because you could judge winning the ball to be crucial to a goal whenever it happens in the buildup. But, in the Premier League, at least, there has been a desire not to look too far back to disallow goals for a foul.\nLast season, 10 goals were disallowed because a foul in the leadup to a goal. From Phil Foden's goal against Liverpool for a foul by Erling Haaland, to Leandro Trossard's strike for Ben White holding on to the arm of Leicester City goalkeeper Danny Ward. But in each case, the goal came very quickly after the incident.\nAfter March is fouled there is another 50-50 challenge for the ball, so Villa didn't achieve possession directly as a result of the foul. There are then several passes over 15 seconds before Diaby has a first shot on goal, which was saved by Steele, before his second effort went in off Estupiñán.\nIt's a tricky judgement call on the attacking phase, but it's consistent in the application we've seen in English football.\nWhat happened: Brighton & Hove Albion got a goal back in the 50th minute through Ansu Fati. The goal came after João Pedro had go to the goal-line and attempted a cut back, and eventually got the ball to a teammate at the second attempt. The VAR began a very lengthy check on the goal. (Watch here.)\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\nVAR review: It took an inordinate amount of time for what seemed like a pretty straightforward VAR check, which looked at two possible situations.\nIn total, the review took 2½ minutes. First, there was a question of the ball being out of play when Pedro controlled it, but it soon became clear the whole of the ball hadn't crossed the goal-line. Second, whether a possible offside against goal scorer Ansu, which seemed to go on and on.\nIt doesn't matter that Pedro's touch sends the ball backwards, the direction the ball goes doesn't matter -- only the position of the attacking player who receives the ball. But the situation is complicated slightly as John McGinn has run off the pitch in trying to challenge Pedro -- it gives the immediate impression that Ansu has to be offside. But in law, McGinn is considered to be on the goal-line, which makes goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez the second defensive player, and the one who creates the offside line.\nThe VAR seemed to spend a long time trying to determine the correct frame for the kick-point by Pedro, but even during this process, it seemed very evident from the naked eye that Ansu was being played onside by the heel of Martinez. The VAR needs to apply the lines to prove this, of course, but it took far too long for what was essentially a straightforward situation.\nWhat happened: Manchester United were already trailing 1-0 to Crystal Palace in the 59th minute and looking for a way back into the game. Bruno Fernandes lifted a ball into the box aimed for Marcus Rashford, and the ball hit the hand of Joel Ward before it could get to the striker. United players appealed for a penalty, but referee Chris Kavanagh said no.    \nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: While Ward did check over his shoulder for the flight of the ball, there's no way this could be considered deliberate after the ball flicked off his hand. Ward also had his back to the ball when it hit him, and his arm was close to his body in an expected position.\nPoor defending to misread the flight, but not a handball offence.\nWhat happened: Palace had a handball appeal of their own in the 90th minute when the ball hit the arm of Sofyan Amrabat. Did Palace have any grounds for a spot kick?\nVAR decision: No penalty. \nVAR review: As with Ward, Amrabat had his arm close to his body, so there was no chance that the VAR, Peter Bankes, would advise a penalty kick.\nAmrabat also had the ball hit onto him at close proximity by Jairo Riedewald.\nWhat happened: Newcastle United were awarded a penalty in the 75th minute when Ameen Al Dakhil brought down Anthony Gordon. The Burnley defender appealed against the decision, and there was an automatic check made by the VAR, Jarred Gillett.\nVAR decision: Penalty stands, scored by Alexander Isak. \nVAR review: A very simple and quick check, despite Al Dakhil's claims that he had got to the ball. It was clear from the angle behind the play that it was a foul, and referee Thomas Bramall had made the correct decision.\nSome parts of this article include information provided by the Premier League and PGMOL."}

(1:27)\nLove it or loathe it, VAR is now an established part of the modern game. When it was introduced back in 2017 we were all lulled into a false sense of security: there would be no more controversy and every decision would be correct.\nIt's not quite worked out like that as human error cannot be eliminated.\nFrom wrongly disallowed goals, to penalties scored after full-time, VAR is never far from the headlines.\nVAR has gone to the very top of the game, having an influence on the results of World Cup and Champions League finals. Countless matches in competitions all over the world have been either aided or -- depending on your own opinion of the controversial officiating tool -- blighted by its involvement.\nIt's worth noting that by \"wild moments\" we're not talking about common contentious fouls and free kicks, nor are we raking back through all the countless times players have been adjudged to be fractionally offside at an atomic level. Instead we focus on some of the notable occurrences when VAR intervention has led truly baffling scenes to break out during a football match.\n- How VAR has affected every Premier League club\n- VAR in the Premier League: The ultimate guide\n- Don't have ESPN? Get instant access\nAntoine Griezmann thought he had scored a dramatic equaliser for France in the 98th minute, but there was a VAR review for offside. But it turned out to be an illegal review.\nVideo evidence showed that referee Matthew Conger had restarted the match, before blowing the final whistle. That meant that by VAR protocol it wasn't possible to review the offside offence. The goal was disallowed and France lost 1-0 to a Tunisia side that headed out of the tournament in the group stage.\nFrance protested against the disallowed goal, but FIFA rejected that appeal. Luckily Les Bleus were already through to the round of 16 and the incident made no difference to their position on top of Group D.\nAn almighty error as the VAR, Darren England, somehow messed up the onfield decision and thought he was checking a goal, when he was in fact checking a disallowed goal.\nEngland worked out that Liverpool forward Luis Díaz was onside, and told the match referee \"check complete.\" But this meant he was saying the on-field decision was correct ... when the on-field decision was offside.\nThe game was 0-0 at the time, and Spurs then scored a minute later and went on to win 2-1.\n- The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Diaz's offside goal\nThe game in September 2022 was 2-2 in added time when Juventus thought they had snatched all three points when substitute Arkadiusz Milik headed home, but the goal was disallowed following a VAR review for offside.\nLeonardo Bonucci was judged to be distracting the goalkeeper as Milik's effort flew towards goal.\nBut the VAR had missed a Salernitana player close to the corner flag who was playing the whole Juventus attack onside. Juve had two players sent off as they protested.\nThe incident led to Serie A bringing in semi-automated offside technology in the middle of the season.\nIn September 2023, Heidenheim were trailing 2-1 at Dortmund in the 76th minute when Jan-Niklas Beste moved into the area and was pulled back by Sébastien Haller. The referee pointed to the penalty spot, but was told by the VAR that Beste was offside. The penalty was cancelled.\nDortmund then decided to substitute Haller, during which time the VAR realised he had made an error in the offside review. There had been a \"deliberate play\" of the ball by Haller, which reset the phase and meant Beste was actually onside.\nThe referee was sent to the pitchside monitor and change the decision to a penalty. Haller should have been sent off for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, but the officials had allowed him to be taken off. The Dortmund player was only booked on the bench, but Heidenheim should have been playing against 10 men. At least they got their penalty ... eventually. It was scored and the game ended 2-2.\nHistory was made in the Bundesliga in April 2018 when Mainz were awarded a penalty during half-time of their match against Freiburg. The referee had signalled the end of the first half and sent the players to their dressing rooms after Mainz had a penalty appeal turned down when right-back Daniel Brosinski's cross deflected off Freiburg centre-back Marc-Oliver Kempf's hand and was saved by goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow.\nAs the players headed for the locker rooms, referee Guido Winkmann ran over to the other side of the pitch to watch the replay on a monitor. He awarded the hosts a penalty, recalling the entire Freiburg side and the handful of Mainz players who had left the pitch.\nSix minutes after the half-time whistle had blown, Pablo de Blasis scored the penalty to put Mainz 1-0 up. He added a second to seal a 2-0 win, though only after the start of the second half was delayed as ground staff had to clear reams of toilet roll thrown on to the pitch by irate Freiburg fans during the break.\nOne of the most costly VAR fails ever came during the A-League Grand Final in May 2018, when a total catastrophe befell the system during Australia's biggest game of the season.\nNine minutes into the title decider, the VAR camera feed went offline for roughly 30 seconds, during which Melbourne Victory managed to score a goal against Newcastle Jets. Television replays showed that the goal was clearly offside, but the VAR system could not be deployed to rectify the situation. Alas, by the time the technical staff managed to get the VAR camera back online the game had resumed and it was too late to review the phase of play in question so the Victory goal was allowed to stand.\nKosta Barbarouses' decisive strike proved to be the only goal in a game which Victory fans still refer to as \"the heist in the Hunter\" -- a reference to one of the McDonald Jones Stadium's former names.\nTottenham once again found themselves on the wrong end of a chaotic VAR episode then they played host to Watford on New Year's Day of 2019. Trailing 0-1 since the sixth minute of the match following Abdoulaye Doucoure's opener, Spurs finally looked to have broken through the Hornets' blockade in the 86th minute when Dele Alli sprang to score a late equaliser. However, celebrations were muted while the goal was checked by VAR for a possible handball by Alli in the build-up.\nWith most people inside the stadium already at a loss as to what was going on, the confusion was ramped up several notches when Alli's goal was simultaneously given by the referee AND declared to have been disallowed by a message on the big screens around the ground. The game then resumed for its final few minutes, and full-time came with most in attendance utterly clueless as to what the final score was (1-1).\nSPAL had every right to feel aggrieved in February 2019 when they saw what might have been a winning goal against Fiorentina chalked off by VAR. The hosts thought midfielder Mattia Valoti had put them 2-1 up against La Viola in the 77th minute, only for referee Luca Pairetto to intervene and rather sour the moment. Attention was drawn to a foul made at the opposite end of the pitch in a previous phase of play in which Fiorentina forward Federico Chiesa was felled in the SPAL penalty box several minutes earlier.\nAs such, following a VAR review, the referee cancelled out SPAL's goal and instead awarded a penalty to Fiorentina, which Jordan Veretout dispatched to put the away side 2-1 up in a remarkable turnaround. Fiorentina went on to win the match 4-1 thanks to additional goals from Giovanni Simeone and Gerson scored in the final 10 minutes, leaving SPAL to wonder what might have been.\nMEDIA RELEASE:Temporary dispensation: no cautions for goalkeeper encroachment during Kicks from the Penalty Mark at the @FIFAWWC 2019.➡️ https://t.co/8Lu7hW207x pic.twitter.com/udqs1B1ODb\nAs if major international tournaments aren't stressful enough, football's lawmakers the International Football Association Board (IFAB) decided to add an extra layer of pressure to the 2019 Women's World Cup by changing the rules regarding penalties halfway through the competition. The tournament had seen several goalkeepers shown yellow cards while facing penalty kicks after being flagged by VAR for moving off their line a fraction too early, resulting in the kicks being retaken. After a succession of controversial incidents during the group stage, the IFAB approved an emergency request from FIFA to make a \"temporary dispensation\" to the law, thus granting 'keepers a reprieve of sorts.\nAs such, the temporary dispensation removed the need for referees to issue mandatory yellow cards for encroachment on the basis that the presence of VAR alone should be enough to deter keepers from jumping the gun -- apart from during penalty shootouts, when the original law would still apply. Clear as day, then.\nThis is incredible. In added time in Bolivia, referee goes to sidelines to make decision to award Always Ready against Bolívar. Signals decision to award penalty using VAR signal. The Bolivian league doesn't have VAR technology. The penalty was not scored.pic.twitter.com/dKMoEHcHXk\nFootage of entire incident (via @gbobadi), showing the chaotic seasons and subsequently missed penalty. But check out how far the Bolívar defender has run into the box before penalty is taken.pic.twitter.com/ccf6bBfni4\nAlways Ready were trailing 1-0 as they entered the final few seconds of added time in their game against Bolivar in August 2019. In a desperate attempt to score an equaliser, they appealed to referee Raul Orosco for a penalty following an aerial clash inside the area. Orosco went over to the sidelines to watch a replay of the incident. Content with what he'd seen on the monitor, the official then returned to the pitch to award the penalty while making the requisite \"VAR\" hand gesture. However, it was at this point it dawned on Orosco that VAR hadn't actually been implemented in the Bolivian Primera Division and so he tried to transform his \"TV screen\" signal into a hurried point toward his earpiece instead.\nThe awarding of the penalty sparked chaos as both sets of players and coaching staff argued on the field for a full 10 minutes, with many repeating the \"VAR\" gesture as they demanded answers. Eventually, sufficient order was restored to allow Always Ready to finally take their controversial spot kick, which hit the post.\nWith minutes to go before half-time in the German second-tier clash between Holstein Kiel and VfL Bochum in October 2019, midfielder Michael Eberwein was busy limbering up with the rest of the Kiel subs behind his side's goal when he made the fatal error of stopping a wayward shot before the ball had gone all the way off the pitch. VAR spotted that this innocent error was in direct contravention of the laws of the game governing substitutes interfering with play, and asked the referee to come over to consult the footage. Sure enough, a penalty was awarded to Bochum and Eberwein was shown a yellow card.\nBochum striker Silvere Ganvoula M'boussy, whose shot off target had sparked the furore, stepped up to convert the penalty. Just to make matters worse, Eberwein had yet to make his debut for Kiel at the time, meaning that he'd also managed to concede a spot kick without making a single appearance for the club. As yet another bitter digestif for Kiel, the German FA (DFB) consulted with the IFAB on the decision and were told that, whilst the referee should have initially given the penalty, the incident did not qualify as an \"exceptional circumstance\" which justified an intervention by VAR, meaning the spot kick really should not have been awarded.\nSpurs (them again) found themselves subjected to a decision so ludicrous that it actually helped bring about a change in the way the Premier League interpreted the law. After falling into line with the rest of Europe and adopting a stricter application of handball, the opening weeks of the 2020-21 Premier League season had already been littered with controversial decisions. Then came the case of Eric Dier.\nSpurs were leading by a single Lucas Moura goal against Newcastle as the September fixture entered added time, only for the visitors to be gifted the very softest of penalties when Dier leapt for a header alongside Andy Carroll. The Newcastle striker won the duel and nudged the ball innocuously against the Spurs defender's flailing arm while he had his back turned.\nReferee Peter Bankes initially missed the non-incident but VAR was on hand to draw his attention to an infringement of the newly implemented (and much-maligned) handball law stating that any ball-to-hand contact in the area might be penalised regardless of whether said contact is intentional or otherwise. Clauses seven and eight of the law were invoked as Dier's \"hand/arm was above/beyond his shoulder level.\"\nCallum Wilson scored his penalty to rescue an unlikely point for Newcastle. However, with frustrations from all quarters already high, the outcry over the decision to punish Dier caused the Premier League to roll back its change and apply a far more liberal interpretation of handball inside the penalty area.\nThe IFAB then tweaked the law the following March, some six months later. The IFAB's new incarnation of the rule dictated that handballs would only be given when the arm is completely away for the body and could not be justifiable by the way the player is moving, for instance jumping like Dier was in order for a foul to be given -- which is actually remarkably similar to the way the law worked before they changed it in the first place.\nIn a truly baffling turn of events, Manchester United strayed even beyond the constraints of \"Fergie Time\" to score their late winner against Brighton in the Premier League back in September 2020.\nThe game looked to be over and done when Solly March scored a 95th-minute equaliser for the Seagulls to make the score 2-2 at the Amex Stadium. However, there was still time for one last twist when United were awarded a penalty AFTER the full-time whistle had sounded. Confusion reigned as referee Chris Kavanagh blew for full-time following a late United corner, only for VAR to ask the official to review a replay of the action in the box. In doing so, Kavanagh noticed an unfortunate handball from Brighton striker Neal Maupay and awarded a penalty to United.\nBruno Fernandes kept his composure to score from the spot and snatch a ludicrous, unprecedented victory for United in the 10th minute of added time of a match that had already been ended once.\nA prime example of VAR being applied too fastidiously came during a game between Crystal Palace and Leeds at Selhurst Park in November 2020. In fine form at the time, Patrick Bamford appeared to have found the net for Leeds once again when he broke the Palace line to score an equaliser for his side with 17 minutes played.\nPatrick Bramford offside because of the change in the handball law. Because you can now pay the ball with the top part of your arm the outstretched arm played him offside. This was onside last season to the armpit. #CRYLEE pic.twitter.com/EezUHdxIYQ\nHowever, the goal was ruled out when VAR deemed Bamford had been offside in the build-up because the striker pointed where he wanted the ball played despite the rest of his body being onside at the time the pass was played. Strictly speaking the decision was correct to the letter of the law as Bamford had pointed using a portion of his arm that he could legally score a goal with, but still...\nPalace went on to win the game 4-1.\n😯 𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗥𝗘𝗜́𝗕𝗟𝗘: hinchas de Gremio invadieron el campo de juego y destrozaron la cabina del VAR💥 Fue después de perder por 3-1 contra Palmeiras por el Brasileirao: el equipo está 19° y en zona de descenso pic.twitter.com/IWaNA4YCal\nLanguishing near the bottom of the table and threatened by relegation, Gremio fans thought their team had hauled their way back into a game against Palmeiras in October 2021 when a potentially crucial equaliser made it 2-2. The swell of optimism quickly gave way to despair when a VAR review disallowed the goal and Gremio went on to slump to a 3-1 defeat in front of their own supporters.\nIt all proved too much for some fans, who decided to rush on to the pitch and take out their frustrations on the technical equipment that had so harshly robbed them.\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Brazil goalkeeper Alisson became the first player to be shown two red cards in the same game and still complete the full match after being spared twice by the VAR. The Liverpool shot-stopper was shown his first red card for a high boot in the 25th minute and then another in stoppage time for knocking striker Ayrton Preciado to the ground while attempting to punch the ball clear.\nHowever, both decisions were overturned after the referee consulted VAR, thus allowing Alisson to finish the game despite being \"sent off\" twice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he was more than happy to sing the praises of the video replay system.\n\"I think this was the first time this has happened in the history of football,\" Alisson said after the match. \"I think that I acted properly in the moves and I think my teammates helped me a lot, they were incisive in their complaints to the referee. This shows once again the importance of using VAR in football. I am happy with the VAR, if it wasn't for the VAR we'd have been punished unfairly.\"\nTempers flared in Serie A last month when mid-table Torino played host to title-chasing Inter Milan at the Stadio Olimpico in Piedmont. Without a win in eight games, the home side defied expectations when Brazilian defender Bremer propelled them in front with an early opener after just 12 minutes. The Granata then carved out a good chance to put themselves further ahead when forward Andrea Belotti found himself clean through on goal only to be upended by the outstretched limb of Inter centre-back Andrea Ranocchia inside the penalty area.\nUnderstandably, Torino appealed in unison only for referee Marco Guida to instruct Belotti to get to his feet. Then, following a brief consultation with VAR official Davide Massa via his headset, Guida was content to let play continue without so much as a pitchside review. In the meanwhile, replays had revealed that Ranocchia had indeed clearly knocked the goal-bound Belotti off his feet before then playing the ball. The game finished 1-1 thanks to a dramatic 93rd-minute equaliser for Inter scored by Alexis Sanchez which, naturally, didn't do anything to calm the incandescent ire of Torino coach Ivan Juric.\n\"It was a clear penalty and nobody understands why it wasn't awarded. I am sure they will try to explain it, but they can't,\" Juric fumed after the final whistle. \"It completely ruined the game, as we would've been 2-0 up.\"\nThe reaction was as we get in the PL.Torino coach: \"It's the latest situation of many when we were penalised. This one is completely inexplicable. It was a clear penalty and nobody understands why it wasn't awarded. I am sure they will try to explain it, but they can't.\" pic.twitter.com/TlK2GhXSz3\nThe Italian press were equally flabbergasted with Tuttosport even awarding referee Guida 0/10 for his performance and branding the turn of events in Turin as a \"scandal.\" Such was the controversy surrounding the errant penalty decision that Serie A themselves stepped in and attempted to diffuse the situation by allowing the Italian Referees' Association (AIA) to release the audio log of the chat between Guida and his VAR official, Massa. \"Ball! Ball! Yes, he got the ball, carry on,\" was the message delivered directly into the ear of the referee.\nThe AIA then proceeded to lay blame squarely at Massa's feet for making what they called a \"serious error,\" with refereeing designator Gianluca Rocchi stating that Massa \"should have looked more carefully at the footage\" before advising Guida to allow play to continue.\nAmid calls for Guida to be banned and/or dropped as a Serie A ref altogether over the incident, Rocchi made sure to add that the AIA wouldn't be prepared to \"lose such a good referee over [the error].\" Still, neither Guida nor Massa have been assigned to officiate a domestic match since the Torino-Inter VAR farce as the fallout continues to simmer away.\nESPN's Dale Johnson contributed to this report"}

(1:56)\nLet the 2023 MLB playoffs begin!\nStarting with this week's wild-card series (beginning Tuesday at 3 p.m. ET on ABC), it's sure to be another thrilling October of postseason baseball. We've got you covered with everything you need to know, from the first pitch of the playoffs to the final out of the World Series.\nWill the favored Atlanta Braves roll through the National League, or will one of the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers or Milwaukee Brewers be the NL's last team standing? Can the Baltimore Orioles turn a 100-plus-win season into a World Series berth, or will we see a deep run from the Texas Rangers or defending champion Houston Astros?\nMLB experts Bradford Doolittle, Alden Gonzalez and David Schoenfield get you ready for it all with odds for every round, a predicted date of each team's last game and a name to watch for all 12 World Series hopefuls.\nNote: World Series and matchup odds come from Doolittle's formula using power ratings as the basis for 10,000 simulations to determine the most likely outcomes.\nJump to a team:\nTOR | TEX | TB | MIN | HOU | BAL\nARI  | MIA | PHI | MIL | LAD | ATL\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers or Rays (49.0% chance of reaching ALCS)\nWorld Series odds: 11.5% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista. Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- Schoenfield\nTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nKurkjian: From raw to really, really good »\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more »\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together (preferably with Bautista) but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- Doolittle\nHouston Astros\nNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champs\nALDS opponent: Twins or Blue Jays (53.6% chance of reaching ALCS)\nWorld Series odds: 12.0% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield \nReady for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000. OK, who am I kidding? You're not rooting for the Astros unless you live in Houston. -- Schoenfield\nKnowing what we know now, which teams should have done more, less -- or exactly the same?\n Judging all 30 clubs one month later »\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Remember '21. If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- Doolittle\nMinnesota Twins\nNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champs\nFirst opponent: Blue Jays (57.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.8% | Caesars odds: +2000\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins get healthy enough? Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis, and manager Rocco Baldelli said he'll play in the playoffs \"but won't be 100%.\" Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue, and his status is uncertain. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. They'll need these players back and producing to avoid adding another chapter to Minnesota's lengthy streak of postseason disappointments. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity will come this postseason. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros and maybe even the Rays. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. Your fondest memories of the Blue Jays remain Dave Stieb and George Bell, not Kevin Gausman and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. But the Twins ... the Twins have lost an unfathomable 18 consecutive playoff games going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins win a series (or four). Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\nCheck out the highlights from some of MLB's best young stars as they head into the postseason, including Ronald Acuna Jr., Adley Rutschman and Corbin Carroll.\nTampa Bay Rays\nNo. 4 seed | 99-63 | AL first wild card\nWild-card opponent: Rangers (58.0% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.3% | Caesars odds: +1200\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 13\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Can the offense get hot at the right time? When the Rays had that amazing start, the offense was on fire and led the majors in runs scored through the end of May. It has been solid since then, but nowhere near as dominant. With Wander Franco on administrative leave, Brandon Lowe out with a patella fracture and Luke Raley questionable due to a cervical strain, they're basically down to Josh Lowe from the left side of the plate (and light-hitting switch hitter Taylor Walls). That means they're going to face a lot of nasty righty relievers that they'll have to beat late in games. -- Schoenfield\nEight teams will take the field, but only four will move on. Watch every wild-card series matchup from Tuesday through Thursday on ESPN and ABC.\nTuesday's schedule:\nTEX-TB: 3 p.m. ET on ABC\nTOR-MIN: 4:30 p.m. ET on ESPN\nARI-MIL 7 p.m. ET on ESPN2\nMIA-PHI 8 p.m. on ESPN\nReady for his October closeup: There are few things we can all agree on these days, but this seems to be one of them: Randy Arozarena loves the big stage. We saw it during the 2020 postseason, a dominant showing before he had even registered 50 major league games. We saw it during this year's World Baseball Classic, with his cowboy boots and sporadic autograph sessions and seemingly endless array of clutch hits. We saw it four months later, when he nearly took down Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to win the Home Run Derby. And we'll probably see it again in October, for a Rays team that desperately needs his production with its starting rotation decimated by injuries and Wander Franco unavailable. Everyone will be looking at Randy Arozarena -- just the way he likes it. -- Gonzalez \nWhy you should root for them: It has been yet another remarkable \"How do they do it?\" season from the Rays. They lost key starting pitchers throughout the season -- Jeffrey Springs in April, Drew Rasmussen in May and Shane McClanahan in early August -- and yet remained in the hunt for the division title in the majors' toughest division until the final weekend. As always, they're aggressive on the bases and have a bunch of dominant relievers you've probably never heard of (check out the stats for one-time cast-offs Robert Stephenson and Shawn Armstrong). If you want to root for the AL team that does the most with the least amount of money, the Rays are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Out-homer them. It's really that simple, and you might say that about every other club that will confront Atlanta. But it's different when we're talking about the Rays because they might be better equipped to do it than anybody. The Rays ranked fifth in homer percentage, though they relied on homers for just 41% of their scoring, as opposed to a historic 52% for the Braves. Like Minnesota, the Rays' staff dominates the strike zone, ranking just behind the Twins in strikeout rate and just ahead of them in walk rate. But what separates the Rays is that they also ranked sixth in homers allowed percentage (third on the road, which filters out some of the park effects). No one has a better profile for winning a series against Atlanta decided by longball prowess. -- Doolittle\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Rays (42.0% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.2% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 5\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman the other night in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi has yet to go more than five innings while slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\nToronto Blue Jays\nNo. 6 seed | 89-73 | AL third wild card\nWild-card opponent: Twins (42.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.7% | Caesars odds: +1800\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. When Guerrero and Bichette reached the majors in 2019 -- Guerrero at 20 years old and Bichette at 21 -- and soon established themselves as two of the top young players in the game, it appeared all the Jays had to do was build around the two future stars. That stardom has been a little hit-and-miss for both players, however, and the Jays have yet to win a playoff game with these two. The Blue Jays have the starting rotation to go all the way, but the offense has been middle-of-the-pack all season. They need Guerrero and Bichette to get hot together. -- Schoenfield\nWe created a new set of accolades to honor the best of the regular season before October arrives.\n Passan's 2023 awards »\nReady for his October closeup: Jose Berrios was a shell of himself last year, leading the American League in earned runs allowed and not pitching in the series when the Blue Jays got knocked out by the Seattle Mariners in two wild-card games. He has since bounced back in dramatic fashion, posting a 3.65 ERA in 189⅔ innings. There are questions about the Blue Jays' underperforming offense heading into the postseason, but their rotation -- fronted by Kevin Gausman -- stands as a major strength. Berrios' resurgence has been a major part of that. And he'll finally get to show why the Blue Jays gave up two high-end prospects to acquire him from the Twins in the summer of 2021, then signed him to a $131 million extension the following offseason. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: When the Blue Jays are clicking, they're a really fun team to watch. No, Guerrero hasn't repeated his monster 2021 season, but he's still one of the biggest names in the sport. The defense, with Kevin Kiermaier and Daulton Varsho in the outfield and Matt Chapman at third, is often spectacular and leads the majors in defensive runs saved. Gausman is a legit No. 1 starter with that nasty, unhittable splitter. And it has been 30 years since they were last in a World Series, when Joe Carter touched 'em all. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Out-defend them. The Toronto pitching staff didn't do a great job of keeping the ball in the park this season and against the Braves; that's a less-than-ideal trait. Last we checked, it's hard to field a ball that flies over the fence, so our recipe here for Toronto has the obvious prerequisite that it has to have some good fortune in the homer-per-fly-ball category. But if that happens, the Blue Jays have a whopping advantage over the Braves in terms of the leading defensive metrics. In particular, their outfield can flat pick it, with the Jays more than doubling the defensive runs saved total of any other outfield. So if the Braves aren't quite barreling it up on their power swings, the abilities of Varsho and Kiermaier to chase everything down could tip a close series. -- Doolittle\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies or Marlins (65.4% chance of reaching NLCS)\nWorld Series odds: 22.4% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: Brewers or D-backs (63.1% chance of reaching NLCS)\nWorld Series odds: 18.6% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\nMilwaukee Brewers\nNo. 3 seed | 92-70 | NL Central champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (61.7% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 4.7% | Caesars odds: +1800\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 14\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The Brewers must get leads to the bullpen, which ranks first in the majors in win probability added (by a large margin). That's basically a proxy for \"clutch\" when it comes to reliever performance and that's what the pen has been all season in leading the Brewers to an excellent record in both one-run and extra-inning games. Closer Devin Williams throws his changeup more than 50% of the time and it's so good it has a nickname: The Airbender. Batters are hitting .098 against it. Joel Payamps has been the key setup guy while Hoby Milner and Bryse Wilson have been excellent as well -- and keep an eye on flame-throwing rookie Abner Uribe, who didn't come up until July but has pitched himself into a high-leverage role. --Schoenfield\nWhich World Series contenders must win now -- or else?\n Bradford Doolittle »\nReady for his October closeup: William Contreras never got much of a chance on star-studded Braves teams over these past few years, seeing a combined 10 postseason plate appearances in 2021 and 2022. Then the Brewers acquired him as part of the three-team trade that sent Sean Murphy to Atlanta in December 2022, and now Contreras -- Willson's younger brother -- stands at the center of a Brewers offense that needs more punch to back up its dynamic pitching staff. Contreras, Christian Yelich and the recently acquired Mark Canha are the only Brewers regulars with an adjusted OPS at least 10% above league average. Contreras needs to produce from the No. 2 spot and handle the rigors of a demanding position. This year, he proved he is up to the task. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Tired of the Braves and Dodgers? Can't find yourself rooting for a team from Philly? Then the scrappy, small-market Brewers are for you! Plus, they've never won a World Series, making it only once, way back in 1982 when they lost to the Cardinals in seven games. This is their fifth playoff trip in six seasons so they've been a consistent contender, with some playoff heartbreak along the way -- a Game 7 loss to the Dodgers in the 2018 NLCS, the late blown lead in the 2019 wild-card game. They deserve your playoff love. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Keep them off the scoreboard. The Brewers are a complete package on the run-prevention side of the game. They have a terrific rotation that looks even better in the postseason format because of their unmatched big three of Corbin Burnes, Brandon Woodruff and Freddy Peralta. They have an elite end-of-game hammer in Williams, and no one is better at bridging the gap between the starters and the closer than Craig Counsell. On top of all that, the Brewers are an elite defensive team that can win games by taking hits away in the infield and outfield alike. If the offense produces anything in October, the Brewers are going to be a team nobody wants to face. Even the Braves. -- Doolittle\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nWild-card opponent: Marlins (64.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 5.2% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\nNo. 5 seed | 84-77 | NL second wild card\nWild-card opponent: Phillies (35.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 1.2% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The rotation will have to absolutely crush it, because the Marlins were last in the NL in runs and the bullpen has been shaky at times. The Marlins are here because they excelled in one-run games (the best record in the majors), so if they can translate that success to the lower-scoring environment of playoff baseball, maybe they can surprise. With Sandy Alcantara injured, Jesus Luzardo is the No. 1 starter and when he's on, he's very tough: He's tied for second (behind only Blake Snell) for the most starts this season allowing no more than one run. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: It seems as if we've been waiting a little too long for Jazz Chisholm Jr. to emerge as a superstar, but perhaps baseball's biggest stage will bring that out of him. We know it's in there. Chisholm, 25, can be lightning in a bottle for this young, scrappy Marlins team, able to impact games with his bat and his legs and his glove (he has played a very nice center field despite never playing there before this season). Chisholm has been good but not great offensively since returning from an oblique strain in late July, but he has shown flashes of brilliance. He probably has more in him. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: If you like October weirdness, then the Marlins are your team. After all, they have a chance now for a third World Series -- even though they've never won a division title and made the playoffs in a full season just three times. Indeed, this rotation is reminiscent of the 2003 world championship group, a young staff featuring Josh Beckett, Dontrelle Willis, Carl Pavano and Brad Penny, all 27 or younger. Luzardo, Braxton Garrett, Eury Perez and Edward Cabrera are all 25 or younger. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Keep it close! The Marlins are in the postseason because they have dominated one-run games, pure and simple. They are 20 games over .500 (33-13) in one-run contests and because of that, a team with a run profile that should land them in the mid-70s in the win column is instead in the mid-80s. Of course, \"keeping it close\" isn't really a strategy. So as we look at the chances of a team that is hard to explain, we can't say that the Marlins could blow through the Braves and the rest of the bracket because they won a lot of close games. We can say that if they do wind up in the World Series, the one-run success -- wherever it sprang from -- will have held up. -- Doolittle\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nWild-card opponent: Brewers (38.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 1.5% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 4\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly. The D-backs' two co-aces could pitch them into the NLDS, but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. Carroll is certainly the star attraction but he's not alone: rookie catcher Gabriel Moreno is going to be another cornerstone player with his defense -- check out his arm -- and improving bat. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}

(0:38)\nEAST RUTHERFORD, NJ. -- The Seattle Seahawks' defense shined as they beat the New York Giants 24-3 at MetLife Stadium on Monday night. Giants QB Daniel Jones turned the ball over three times and was sacked 10 times.\nIt wasn't all great for the Seahawks as safety Jamal Adams was lost early in the first quarter after being evaluated for a concussion. It was his first game back since he suffered a torn left quad tendon in last season's opening game.\nThis season marks the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 Seahawks team that won Super Bowl XLVIII, a feat that seems like longer than a decade ago given all the suspect defense Seattle has played of late.\nBut on Monday night, in the same stadium where they claimed their lone Lombardi Trophy, the Seahawks turned back the clock and delivered a dominant defensive performance reminiscent of that 43-8 trouncing of the Denver Broncos.\nEleven sacks. Three takeaways plus a pair of turnovers on downs. A defensive touchdown. Only a field goal allowed.\nEat your heart out, Legion of Boom.\nCornerback Devon Witherspoon, the high-flying rookie cornerback whose aggressive style would have fit right in with the LOB, helped turn a close game into a runaway victory for Seattle with a 97-yard pick-six in the third quarter.\nThe Seahawks are 3-1 despite a long list of injuries, and they appeared to dodge another serious one when Geno Smith briefly left the game after hurting his knee. Teams usually don't like byes in Week 5, but the Seahawks won't complain about that right now.\nBuy on a breakout performance: This was already shaping up to be Witherspoon's breakout before his pick-six. He had a sack of Jones on a blitz and was credited with another sack on a backward pass. His touchdown came at a clutch time, with the Giants knocking on the door of a score that could have cut Seattle's lead to three points. The Seahawks were second-guessed left and right after taking Witherspoon fifth overall instead of Jalen Carter, who would have filled their most glaring need. But in addition to their off-the-field concerns with Carter, they also thought Witherspoon was the better player. Time will tell there, of course, but Witherspoon's immense talent is starting to shine after a slow start.\nPromising trend: Eleven sacks is a beyond promising development for Seattle's pass rush. It had been inconsistent over the first three games before exploding against the Giants. The 11 sacks tied a franchise record and more than doubled their combined total (five) heading into Monday night's game. Bobby Wagner, Jordyn Brooks, Witherspoon and Uchenna Nwosu all had two sacks apiece. This marks the first time since 1987 that a team had four players with multiple sacks in a game, per ESPN Stats & Information. The Seahawks have generated an NFL-best 46 pressures over the last two games, according to ESPN Stats & Info. They've had 20-plus pressures in both games, the first time they've done that in consecutive games since ESPN began tracking pressures in 2009.\nQB breakdown: Smith hadn't missed a snap in his first 21 games as the Seahawks' starter until he went down with a knee injury in the second quarter on a sideline tackle. He returned for the start of the second half and finished 13-of-20 for 110 yards and a touchdown. Drew Lock went 2-of-6 for 63 yards in relief, including tight end Noah Fant's 51-yard catch-and-run that set up a Walker III touchdown.\nTroubling trend: Adams' much-anticipated return lasted all of nine plays. He went down on the opening possession after taking a knee to the helmet and was ruled out after being evaluated for a concussion. Adams can't catch a break. Entering Monday night, he has missed 28 of a possible 53 regular-season games since Seattle acquired him in the blockbuster trade with the Jets in 2020. Also on Monday night, the Seahawks lost guards Damien Lewis (ankle) and Phil Haynes (calf) to injuries. Nose tackle Jarran Reed (shin) also left. -- Brady Henderson\nNext game: at Cincinnati Bengals (1 p.m. ET, Sunday, Oct. 15)\nThe Giants' offense is a mess. Jones has regressed to his old turnover-prone form. The result is the Giants' season has quickly slipped away only four ugly games into the season. Jones lost a fumble and threw two interceptions -- one that was returned 97 yards for a touchdown when the game was still in reach. Not that he received much help. The offensive line was a disaster and allowed 11 sacks. The Giants' special teams committed six penalties. This was bad. As the season slips away, the Giants will have to do something with road games in Miami and Buffalo on deck. It could get worse before it gets better.\nQB breakdown: Jones completed 27 of 34 passes for 203 yards and 2 interceptions. This isn't the quarterback everyone saw in the first season under coach Brian Daboll last season. Sure, Jones is under constant pressure, but he's also not playing well. Both can be true. The three turnovers were all on Jones. He now has six through four games this season. Did the Giants make a mistake giving Jones that $160 million deal? This was the third time in four games that he has played poorly. New York needs much better or this season will spiral out of control.\nTroubling trend: The Giants have been outscored 77-9 in first half of games this season. To say they've struggled in the first half would be an understatement. The Giants have yet to score a first-half touchdown through four games. They've managed only field goals of 44, 55 and 57 yards. Their minus-68 point differential in the first half of games is tied for the fourth worst for a team through four games in the Super Bowl era. This after the Giants talked all week about finding ways to start faster. It again didn't work.\nEye-popping NFL Next Gen stat: Seahawks tight end Fant's 19.8 expected yards after catch. That was what Fant was expected to get after being 15.34 yards from the nearest defender on his 51-yard catch late in the second quarter. But Fant got so much more, thanks to missed tackles along the sideline by inside linebacker Bobby Okereke and cornerback Adoree' Jackson. Fant racked up 46 yards after the catch on the play, and eventually was ruled down at the 1-yard line. Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III scored on the very next play.

(1:04)\nANAHEIM, Calif. -- Phil Nevin will not return as manager of the Los Angeles Angels, the team announced Monday.\nThe move comes a day after the club finished the season at 73-89. The Angels didn't schedule an end-of-the-season news conference with general manager Perry Minasian immediately after the season finale, raising questions about his future after three unsuccessful years in charge.\nMinasian will be available to the media Tuesday, the team said.\nIn making the official announcement, the Angels said that they have declined their option on Nevin's contract for 2024. Los Angeles will have its fourth manager in six years since the departure of Mike Scioscia, who held the job for 19 years.\nThe Angels flirted with playoff contention this season and went into \"buyer\" mode at the trade deadline. But they quickly faded from the race and placed several of their new additions on waivers.\nIn the end, Los Angeles finished 17 games behind the Houston Astros in the American League West, as well as 17 games off the pace in the wild-card race.\nThe Angels defeated the Oakland Athletics 7-3 on Sunday to close the season.\n\"I know it didn't go the way we wanted, but I'm proud of the way that room held together,\" Nevin said Sunday. \"It wasn't fun. It's not fun ending the way we did, but it's a great group in there. There's a lot of great things that are on the horizon here with the young players and the guys coming back. Good future.\"\nNevin went 119-149 in his first major league managerial job and missed the postseason in both of his seasons at the helm. He was promoted to Angels manager in June 2022 when Joe Maddon was fired in the middle of a 14-game losing streak.\nNevin, who had joined Maddon's staff as his third-base coach in November 2021, became the first Orange County native to manage the Angels.\nAs a former elite infielder who still carries himself like a ballplayer, Nevin appeared to be well-liked by his players. But the Angels didn't win for him, finishing 46-60 after he took over in 2022 before authoring the franchise's eighth straight losing record this season.\nNevin became the third MLB manager let go in four days, following Gabe Kapler of the San Francisco Giants and Buck Showalter of the New York Mets.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

Then I received a message that Xander was back on the team. That you can quote.

Europe has claimed eight of the past 11 Ryder Cups, as the U.S. team failed to end a road drought that dates to 1993.\nThe PGA of America, which runs the Ryder Cup in conjunction with Ryder Cup Europe, declined to comment to The Times and had not immediately replied to other media outlets' inquiries.\nThe Americans had an awful start to the competition, and the emotionally charged event was heightened by a story in Sky Sports reporting a fracture on the U.S. team led by Patrick Cantlay, who allegedly thought players should be compensated to play in the Ryder Cup. They are paid $200,000 to go to the charity of their choosing.\nCantlay repeatedly denied the allegation, saying the story was false and that he wasn't wearing a team hat because it didn't fit, not out of protest. He said the Ryder Cup was about representing the country and not about getting paid for competing.\nStill, he was taunted by spectators waving their hats toward him, and U.S. teammates showed a playful side by tipping their hats at him after a match victory.\nCantlay and Xander Schauffele apparently wanted the player agreement amended so that a Netflix documentary crew didn't have access to the team room while filming a second season of the \"Full Swing\" series, for which players are not compensated.\nLater, U.S. captain Zach Johnson said the team voted unanimously to keep out cameras to preserve the \"sanctity and sacredness of\" the team room.\nStefan Schauffele said more discussions are needed between the U.S. players, the PGA of America and Team Europe about how the money from the Ryder Cup is distributed. Instead, the organization is being secretive and noncommunicative, he said.\n\"They are using players' intellectual properties to make money, and the American players don't get paid,\" Stefan Schauffele told The Times. \"More importantly, this would become a nonissue if all proceeds, net proceeds, from the Ryder Cup were to be donated to common charitable causes. Right now, the American players are asked to donate their time pro bono in the name of patriotism so these organizations can benefit from the profits.\n\"The PGA [of America] uses this money, and the PGA Tour gets 20% that goes into the retirement of every member. The 12 players supposedly need to eat it, and their intellectual property gets abused for the benefit of 200 other people. That's not right.\""}

(0:45)\nPLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- Perhaps no NBA player has been associated with load management and the league's new player participation policy more than LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, but Leonard pushed back on that policy during the team's media day Monday -- saying that \"no league policy is helping me to play more games.\"\nLeonard was making his first comments since tearing the meniscus in his right knee during the Clippers' first-round playoff series against the Phoenix Suns in April. That injury marked the second time in three years that Leonard, 32, suffered a right knee injury in the postseason. He tore his right ACL during the second round of the team's 2021 run to the Western Conference finals.\nAfter that ACL injury, Leonard missed the 2021-22 season. He has not played in more than 60 games in any season since 2016-17.\nWhen first asked about the new policy that was passed last month, which states that teams must ensure no more than one star player is unavailable for the same game, Leonard asked what the new rules were.\nWhen a reporter answered, Leonard responded by noting that his on-again, off-again availability with the Toronto Raptors in the 2018-19 season -- when he led the team to a championship -- came while he was rehabilitating a knee injury.\n\"I'm not a guy that's sitting down because I'm doing load management -- well, when I was with the Raptors, it was different; like, I was coming [off] an injury,\" he said. \"And you have to know the details from the doctor.\n\"But if the league is seeing or trying to mock what I did with the Raptors, they should stop because I was injured during that whole year. But other than that, if I'm able to play, I'll play basketball. I work out every day in the summertime to play the game. So, no league policy is helping me to play more games.\"\nRegarding the new policy, Clippers coach Ty Lue said, \"If our players are healthy, they're going to play. I know there's a big thing, like, our guys don't like to play or whatever, but that's not true. Our guys want to play. Unfortunately, they've had injuries ... So, if our guys are healthy, they're going to play, and that's all we're really focused on.\"\nLeonard suffered his meniscus injury during the first game of the Clippers' first-round series against the Suns in April. He played through it in Game 2 of that series and then was ruled out for the next three games. Leonard underwent a cleanup procedure on the meniscus on June 6.\nLeonard said he didn't do anything especially new this offseason in terms of preparing his body for the season. Instead, he focused on the fickle nature of some injuries.\n\"It's a matter of, if you're going to trip on somebody; a lot of my injuries last year, I stepped on someone's foot or ran into somebody,\" Leonard said. \"You've got to control what you can control and get the treatments that you can and listen to your body, keep moving and see what happens.\"\nLeonard added later, \"You either going to get hurt or you're going to be lucky enough to play games throughout the playoffs or the whole regular season ... I'm not trying to get to a certain amount of games. I'm trying to play the games I can play. If I'm hurt, I can't play basketball. The last two years, unfortunately, I got hurt, tore my ACL, then, at the end of the year, tore my meniscus. It's basketball.\n\"I'm a two-way player. I play hard, so injuries are going to come. I'm not out there just walking around. I play both ends of the floor. I see the best players on both ends every night. Either I'm guarding the best player or the best player is guarding me. If an injury comes, that's what happens.\"\nLast week, Lawrence Frank, the Clippers' president of basketball operations, said Leonard and Paul George -- who was sidelined by a right knee sprain in that first-round series against Phoenix -- are \"fully healthy\" entering the team's training camp in Hawaii.\nFor all the acclaim when Leonard and George joined the Clippers, the two have rarely been healthy together during their four seasons together. They played just 38 games together last season, and, all told, they've played in just 142 total regular-season and postseason games combined, during which the team has posted a 96-46 record.\nWhen asked about the league's new policy, George said, \"If healthy, absolutely, I'm suiting up, and I want to play every night.\""}

(1:32)\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith limped off the field and missed two series late in the first half Monday night after a questionable tackle near the sideline by New York Giants linebacker Isaiah Simmons.\nSmith injured his knee on the play. He remained in the game for one more play before getting attended to in the medical tent.\n\"A dirty play. Dirty play,\" Smith told ESPN's Lisa Salters after he returned for the second half of Seattle's 24-3 victory. \"You guys can see it. It was a dirty play. It's no place in this sport for that and hopefully something happens, but other than that, the grace of God allowed me to come back into this game and I'm happy to be back out there.\"\nSmith made his displeasure known immediately. He later got flagged for taunting when he returned to the game in the third quarter.\nHe was still upset after the game despite the Seahawks (3-1) cruising into the bye week coming off a win. Smith finished 13-of-20 passing for 110 yards and a touchdown.\n\"I just don't respect that type of stuff,\" Smith said. \"There's no need for that type of stuff. It's a hard-fought game out there. We're all battling, but there's no need to take shots at guys running out of bounds on the sideline.\"\nSmith looked to be a bit limited upon returning and was moving gingerly on the knee. But he insists it's nothing major.\n\"I'm fine. I'm fine. God is good,\" he said.\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll's biggest gripe seemed to be more about how Smith was taken down than where. The play occurred near the Giants sideline after Smith had his pass batted back to him.\nIt actually went as a reception for minus-2 yards on the play.\n\"Yeah, that looked so dangerous,\" Carroll said. \"I don't know why we didn't see that differently. It just looked so dangerous. All of the effect of a horse-collar tackle happened, with the swing of the body that pulls down the back of the legs, and he got hurt on that play. A penalty wouldn't have rectified that, but it just looked like such a dangerous play it might have warranted a second look.\"\nThe Giants didn't feel the same about the hit. They thought it was clean.\nSimmons says he was just trying to make a tackle. Smith was running for yards after catching his own pass.\n\"I really don't got much to say about it,\" Simmons said. \"We playing football. He's mad he got hit? What do most quarterbacks do when they don't want to get hit? They go down. I don't really know what else to tell him about that.\"\nSimmons insists it was clean and that he started the tackle in bounds.\n\"Yeah, nobody is trying to hurt anybody out there. I want everyone to be great, you know what I mean? Nobody is trying to hurt anybody, so I would hate anyone intentionally trying to hurt me,\" Simmons said. \"None of that was intended. We're just trying to play hard and win.\"\nSmith originally thought it was safety Xavier McKinney who made the questionable tackle. The two had words on the field later in the series.\nMcKinney didn't seem too concerned about the play afterward.\n\"I don't know. I really don't care to be honest what he is saying or what he is doing,\" McKinney said. \"Don't really matter.\n\"Yeah, I thought the hit was fine.\" He chuckled. \"He'll be all right.\""}
{"title": "Goalie tandem picks: Which player should you draft?", "date": "2023-10-03 12:54:37", "text": "I feel like it's safer trying to predict the rainfall on a day six months from now than it is to confidently state how the goaltender position will play out in the coming fantasy hockey season.\nThat's not to say there aren't safer bets out there -- but you have to pay for them. Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Jake Oettinger, Connor Hellebuyck ... they are likely to be better investments for your fantasy squad, but they'll cost a high draft pick.\nBut winning your league last year was better accomplished by drafting Linus Ullmark and Alexandar Georgiev, which was just a matter of backing the right two sleepers. Who will those sleepers be this season? As implied, that's a tough call.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nMore than ever, a winning fantasy strategy can be lifted from the world of tandems. When one emerges and dominates, it's a low-cost draft investment that can lead to championships (think Ullmark). But even if the time split remains, goaltenders can earn fantasy value -- Ilya Samsonov placed 108th overall last season with only 50.2% crease share and Filip Gustavsson was 81st overall with only 46.5% crease share.\nWe've listed the teams below most likely to use a tandem this season. Some are more likely than others and some are just a guess given the current status of their goaltenders. There's also a chance we missed some that could emerge. But when doing your draft shopping for your crease, don't overlook the potential value of a goaltender projected to get just 50% of the crease share.\nRelevant stats for each goaltender include their crease share from last season, their overall ranking for fantasy, their fantasy points per 60 minutes, and their average draft position so far this draft season. Remember that an ADP higher than about 220 means they are not being drafted in most ESPN leagues.\nLinus Ullmark: 58.9% crease share, fourth overall fantasy points, 5.38 fantasy points per game (FPP60), 38.2 average draft position (ADP)\nJeremy Swayman: 41.1% crease share, 144th overall, 4.04 FPP60, 108.6 ADP\nThis is the potential tandem that will offer the most headaches for fantasy managers. Ullmark blew away the field last season and would be a no-brainer first-round fantasy pick if we knew he was going to do it again. But so many offseason changes, not the least of which was the retirement of Patrice Bergeron, leaves a lot of questions. Are the Bruins as good defensively? Do they win as frequently? But even beyond those questions, Swayman earned himself a raise and a chance to prove he has a long-term future as a starter for the club.\nI would not advise paying the premium for Ullmark given the question marks, but if he falls in your lap closer to the 70th-overall pick, I could get on board. Given that Swayman is on the weak side of the tandem, his draft price of 108th on average is also on the high end. But let's be clear: Both of these goaltenders have the potential to be fantasy difference-markers in 2023-24. The problem is that we can't say that with heaps of confidence for either one.\nAdin Hill: 33.7% crease share, 451st overall, 3.02 FPP60, 211.3 ADP\nLogan Thompson: 49.1% crease share, 248th overall, 2.99 FPP60, 241.9 ADP\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nNeither goaltender was a staple of fantasy clubs for most of last season, though Thompson had some nice runs earlier in the campaign. But we all know what Hill did after the regular season in leading the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup. There's an argument to be made that this isn't a tandem coming into the season, with Hill earning a massive raise, but Hill has never played more than 27 games in an NHL season before, so it's hard to call him a workhorse starter at this stage.\nThis will probably be a \"hot-hand\" crease, with whichever goaltender is having a solid run getting the lion's share of starts. After Hill was so dominant in the postseason, he would be my preference for a fantasy team. That said, there is a chance you can secure both later in drafts and have the crease of the defending champions locked up on your roster.\nStuart Skinner: 58.9% crease share, 132nd overall, 2.86 FPP60, 158.0 ADP\nJack Campbell: 41.1% crease share, 627th overall, 1.29 FPP60, 229.0 ADP\nThis tandem, like the Golden Knights, had a flip-flop from the regular season to the postseason. Skinner was the hero in the regular season, taking the starting job away from Campbell and keeping the Oilers on track for the playoffs. But Skinner stumbled in the postseason, with Campbell coming on in relief multiple times and not looking too bad. That narrative from the playoffs was arguably enough for a soft reset on whose crease this is coming into 2023-24.\nThe Oilers should win plenty of games with their overpowered offense and upgraded defense, but who is going to be in the crease for most of those wins? Skinner's ADP is very palatable, but you shouldn't completely count out Campbell at this stage. In fact, this might be an old school insurance scenario in which drafting Skinner means you should target Campbell in the final rounds to play it safe.

When both Andersen and Raanta were hurt last season, Kochetkov had a chance to show he could do the job in net. But the rookie faded with his chances later in the season, ultimately leaving the Hurricanes to decide to re-sign both Andersen and Raanta on fairly short-term deals. Kochetkov, now 24, can be sent down to the AHL without risking waivers, so he'll be the No. 3 goaltender for the Canes this season.\nThen there's the Andersen or Raanta debate. Raanta was the better goaltender of the two last season, posting better ratios and almost as many wins in fewer starts, but we are only two years removed from when Andersen finished 24th overall in fantasy in 2021-22 with 3.85 FPP60.\nHealth will be the first and foremost concern, as Andersen and Raanta were both fragile last season and the season prior (recall that Andersen missed the 2021-22 playoffs). That said, the Hurricanes wouldn't invest in Andersen and Raanta again unless they thought one of them could be the guy for at least one more season with Kochetkov still waiver eligible. Andersen's ADP is actually trending low if he ends up getting the bulk of starts here, which is the most likely scenario.\nCam Talbot: 40.1% crease share, 587th overall, 1.57 FPP60 (with Ottawa Senators), 219.5 ADP\nPheonix Copley: 42.2% crease share, 351st overall, 2.56 FPP60, 230.2 ADP\nAs much as Copley saved the Kings from themselves last season, he apparently didn't do enough to get a clear shot at the starter's gig yet. Copley was a huge stabilizer for the Kings last season, winning twice as many games as anyone else on the roster. But his ratios weren't great and faded down the stretch. The Kings brought in Joonas Korpisalo at the trade deadline, but Korpisalo opted for the Ottawa Senators in the offseason. The natural choice from there? Sign the Senators goaltender from last season. Cam Talbot had a rough year, earning almost no fantasy value, and is now 36 years old. The age is a major concern, as Talbot is past the spot on the goaltender curve where they usually remain productive for fantasy. But Copley, adequate, wasn't exactly changing the game for fantasy managers in his 37 games last season.\nTalbot hasn't had as much wear and tear as some other 36-year-old goaltenders, spending a lot of his career as a backup. So there is a world in which he can pull out another solid season behind a solid squad. Copley doesn't have a lot of upside, so the ideal situation here is Talbot hanging on for another year of value and getting the bulk of starts. He's the one to take a chance on.\nVitek Vanecek: 59.0% crease share, 111th overall, 3.08 FPP60, 116.2 ADP\nAkira Schmid: 18.2% crease share, 574th overall, 3.48 FPP60, 228.4 ADP\nJordan Binnington: 71.4% crease share, 541st overall, 1.00 FPP60, 228.1 ADP\nJoel Hofer: 6.4% crease share, 805th overall, 2.16 FPP60, 230.0, ADP\nNeither of these teams look like they will have a tandem on paper. But Schmid and Hofer have both shown glimpses and are both 23 coming into the season, which is about the age goaltenders really start coming on. If you are drafting Vanecek, Schmid is a good idea to handcuff. You probably shouldn't be looking at Binnington for your crease, but Hofer has upside if he pushes for more time.\nReady to play?

However, he failed to score a KO victory over a smaller Jermell Charlo -- who was moving up two divisions for the challenge -- to make a claim for a higher spot in the top 10.\nAlvarez (60-2-2, 39 KOs) dominated the fight from the start and dropped Charlo in Round 7 with a powerful overhand right. Alvarez won by scorecards of 118-109, 118-109 and 119-108, but he hasn't scored a stoppage win in almost two years -- an 11th-round TKO against Caleb Plant in November 2021.\nWith the three fighters in front of him in ESPN's pound-for-pound rankings -- Terence Crawford, Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk -- scoring incredible KO victories in their most recent fights, Alvarez wasn't able to convince our panelists to move him up the ladder.\nFurthermore, two-division champion and current ESPN boxing analyst and a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Timothy Bradley Jr., dropped Alvarez one spot on his list.\n\"While I understand that personal preferences, expectations and entertainment play a role in the P4P it's important to acknowledge and evaluate the reality of each fighter's performances,\" Bradley told ESPN. \"In this case of the top pound-for-pound boxers in the world, it's reasonable to expect dominant performances against opponents who are significantly lighter. Their skills and abilities are widely recognized, and it's natural to assume that they would overpower and knockout opponents outside their weight class.\n\"Regarding Canelo's recent performance, he fought a junior middleweight as a super middleweight 168-pounder and had a subpar performance, in my eyes.

{"title": "USWNT Big Board: With no coach and no momentum, how will 2024 Olympics team look?", "date": "2023-10-04 15:19:36", "text": "Lynn Williams joins \"Futbol Americas\" to talk about why the USWNT failed at the FIFA Women's World Cup. (1:41)\nThe U.S. women's national team has no coach, no coherent tactical identity and nothing to build upon after a worst-ever round-of-16 exit in the Women's World Cup. And yet the USWNT is about 10 months away from another marquee tournament in the form of the 2024 Olympics.\nLet's start out with a basic point: the Olympics, which are a senior competition on the women's side (unlike the men's side), -- are not nearly as important as the World Cup. At just 12 teams, it's not even half the size of the World Cup. But winning a gold medal at the Olympics in France next summer would certainly soothe some of the sting from hitting that lowest point in USWNT history -- a round of 16 exit -- this year.\nWho will be the players who can help the USWNT do that? It's hard to say with any certainty without a coach. Enter ESPN's 2024 USWNT Big Board.\nRemember: the point of the Big Board is not to predict what the team will look like next summer, but take the pulse of where the USWNT stands right now. Will the next coach have a turnkey roster and strong player pool to work with? Or will he or she need to do some work to get the squad into shape? Let's take a look.\nIf the USWNT were to compete in the Olympics today, who should start? Who should be on the roster? That's what we're trying to figure out.\nThere's no coach, of course -- U.S. Soccer wants to hire one by December -- so we have no previous lineups or statements on which to base this depth chart. Instead, this is a bit of the author's opinion (hi, that's me!) and a bit of analyzing where the player pool seems to be trending. We don't know if the USWNT will drastically change formations under the new coach -- wingbacks, anyone? -- so for now we're assuming the USWNT's tactical shape will look similar to how it has for the past few years.\nAn important roster note up top, too: Olympic rosters are much different than for the World Cup. They are traditionally much smaller than World Cup rosters -- while a Women's World Cup squad comprises 23 players, with three of them required to be goalkeepers, an Olympic squad is just 18 players, with two specific goalkeepers.\nAnother difference is that Olympic rosters have four alternates, one of them a goalkeeper -- players who aren't available for games, but do travel and train with the team, only joining the roster in case of tournament-ending injury. For the delayed 2021 Olympics, alternates were added to the full roster because of the pandemic, but it's unclear whether that will happen again.\nWe're categorizing the Big Board like this:\nTier 1: Starters.  A clear first-choice player.\nTier 2: In the squad. Not a starter, but a substitute and player on the bench available to go into games.\nTier 3: On the bubble.  These are possible alternates, or players who might miss out on the Olympics completely. Players who have had a passing look or players who were once integral but no longer seem in favor fit into this category.\nTier 4: Longshots. These are the players whose chances of making the Olympics at the moment look low. This includes players performing well for their clubs who haven't gotten a look. This category also includes injured players who, today, aren't healthy enough to make it (and it doesn't mean their status can't change once they recover).\nStarter:  Alyssa Naeher\nIn the squad:  Casey Murphy\nOn the bubble:  Aubrey Kingsbury, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Katie Lund, Jane Campbell, Bella Bixby\nLongshot:  Adrianna Franch\nOther than centerback Naomi Girma, who was a breakout star in her debut World Cup, the USWNT's best player in New Zealand and Australia was quite possibly Alyssa Naeher. She continues to play well for the USWNT, even if she hasn't enjoyed the same level of shot-stopping domestically with her Chicago Red Stars.\nThe question: who will be her backup? Casey Murphy still seems to be the No. 2 and based on her time with the USWNT, that probably hasn't changed, regardless of anything happening in the NWSL. But Aubrey Kingsbury, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Katie Lund, Jane Campbell and Bella Bixby are all viable options as a third goalkeeper or an alternate. After Adrianna Franch lost her starting spot in Kansas City and then didn't make the USWNT's World Cup team, it seems her time with the national team is over.\nAubrey Kingsbury, 31, was the third goalkeeper at the World Cup based on her strong club play for the Washington Spirit. But 26-year-old Tullis-Joyce, who just completed a move to Manchester United, and 26-year-old Lund, who has been excellent for Racing Louisville, could deserve a shot. It's not too soon to get some younger goalkeepers time with the team and get a succession plan behind 35-year-old Naeher. In fact, it probably makes more sense to call in some younger, less experienced goalkeepers for the third and fourth spots.\nStarters: Crystal Dunn, Emily Fox\nIn the squad:  Sofia Huerta\nOn the bubble:  M.A. Vignola, Kelley O'Hara, Casey Krueger, Hailie Mace, Carson Pickett\nLongshot:  Jenna Nighswonger, Imani Dorsey, Caprice Dydasco, Kristen McNabb, Merritt Mathias\nCrystal Dunn shares her hopes for what she would like to see from the next USWNT manager.\nIt's really hard to say who should or will be on the team outside of the starters, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox, who didn't really do anything to lose their spots during the World Cup. It seems like everyone else is fighting just to get a call.\nSofia Huerta has had a lot of call-ups with the USWNT, but she's better at attacking than defending, thus she can be a liability, and she didn't play during the World Cup. Kelley O'Hara has been consistently solid for the USWNT, but she's increasingly injury prone as she nears the twilight of her career. Casey Krueger has been a better defender than attacker and the USWNT likes to play more attacking soccer, but she's solid enough on both sides that she has a strong case.\nM.A. Vignola just earned her first cap for the USWNT in a friendly last month. Hailie Mace and Carson Pickett have both been in with the USWNT before, but very much seem to be on the outskirts of the player pool. That gives way to several players who have been good for their clubs, but have been unable to gain a foothold in the USWNT.\nIf I were coach -- and to be clear, U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker has not called me yet -- I'd start turning the page to the 2027 World Cup cycle. That could mean potentially bringing in Vignola because the USWNT desperately needs to build some fullback depth. A player like 22-year-old Jenna Nighswonger isn't ready for the Olympics, but might deserve a call-up based on solid NWSL play, versatility in being able to play multiple positions and, again, an alarming lack of depth in the pool. The USWNT needs more options.\nGoing into the Olympics, the USWNT's defense has been solid enough that leaning a bit more attack-minded for the Olympics with Huerta seems worth it. The next coach, who will be coming in with no track record, might feel the need to go with a safer choice like Krueger or O'Hara.\nStarters:  Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson\nIn the squad:  Emily Sonnett\nOn the bubble:  Becky Sauerbrunn, Alana Cook\nLongshot:  Abby Dahlkemper, Emily Madril, Lilly Reale, Sarah Gorden, Katie Ling, Paige Nielsen, Sam Hiatt, Sam Staab, Emily Menges, Tatumn Milazzo\nFirst of all, is Emily Sonnett even a centerback? Is she a fullback? Is she a defensive midfielder now? This is something the next coach needs to decide, but right now we're slotting her in at centerback because the USWNT has few proven options there. We've also given her a confirmed spot in the squad because on a small Olympics roster, having a player who can fit multiple positions is incredibly valuable.\nIt might seem a bit harsh to drop Alana Cook from being on the World Cup team to fighting for a spot for the Olympics, but she didn't play at all during the tournament and, in the lead-up to the World Cup, Cook didn't really do enough in games to have earned a spot. An injury to Becky Sauerbrunn and a too-late recovery from Tierna Davidson seemed like the catalyst.\nWith Julie Ertz retired, clear starter Naomi Girma could use another veteran alongside her, and Sauerbrunn is still not playing 90 minutes since her pre-World Cup injury. Davidson fits the bill. Abby Dahlkemper only recently returned from a long layoff for a back injury; she needs more games under her belt, but it's a promising return for the former USWNT centerback.\nStarters:  Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Andi Sullivan\nIn the squad:  Ashley Sanchez, Savannah DeMelo, Sam Coffey\nOn the bubble:  Jaedyn Shaw, Kristie Mewis, Taylor Kornieck\nLongshot:  Jaelin Howell, Olivia Moultrie, Samantha Mewis, Morgan Gautrat, Dani Weatherholt, Lo'eau LaBonta, Chloe Ricketts, Korbin Albert\nThe go-to trio of Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan and Andi Sullivan feels like it shouldn't change -- unless the USWNT changes its formation and configures its midfield differently. (Let's face it, the USWNT probably needs to change its tactical system based on the players it has, but that's a whole other conversation.) Regardless, these are three players who should be at the Olympics.\nSullivan has taken a lot of criticism for not being Ertz, basically, but under the right tactical setup (i.e., the too-late formation shift against Sweden at the World Cup), she is a solid defensive midfielder. We don't know what tactical setup the USWNT will have under the next coach, but there isn't a tactical system in which Sullivan suddenly doesn't have any role with the USWNT.\nOutside of these three, however, it's time for the USWNT to go younger. Ashley Sanchez, 24, didn't play at all at the World Cup, and she should've. With the sensational season that 25-year-old Savannah DeMelo was having, it seemed unfair to name her to the World Cup roster without a USWNT cap to her name. She had no time to build chemistry with the players around her or figure out where she fit in, and we didn't see her at her best.\nSam Coffey, 24, should be the USWNT's next defensive midfielder. Jaelin Howell, 23, is currently injured, but is an interesting alternative to Coffey.\nStarter: Lynn Williams, Trinity Rodman\nIn the squad:  Alyssa Thompson\nOn the bubble:  Margaret \"Midge\" Purce\nLongshot:  Mallory Swanson, Cece Kizer, Melanie Barcenas, Christen Press, Tobin Heath\nHerc Gomez brands Megan Rapinoe's 17-year USWNT career one of the most dominant eras in sporting history.\nMallory Swanson is listed as a long shot right now only because she's injured. (If Swanson had been healthy, the USWNT's World Cup probably would've gone much better.)\nNo one on the USWNT right now provides the service and creates the chances that now-retired Megan Rapinoe used to, particularly on set pieces. In a sense, that makes this position feel more open than the relative strength of the player options suggests. The USWNT needs wingers who can play provider -- the World Cup, where it seemed like the USWNT's wingers were just strikers, proved that.\nLynn Williams is a dependable player who will press relentlessly, create chances, track back to defend and do all the things the USWNT needs. She might not be the best at everything, but she is good and well rounded. Trinity Rodman, under the right setup, will flourish on the wing. Rodman didn't flourish during the World Cup, but that's why the Olympics can't be the same lineup as the World Cup was -- almost no one flourished. Move some pieces around Rodman and change her role slightly, and her effectiveness should be unlocked.\nEven after making the World Cup team, Alyssa Thompson's inclusion seems more about building toward 2027 rather than winning an Olympics. If you want to follow the model of former coach Jill Ellis, who bombed at an Olympics but then won a World Cup, this makes sense. She barely played at the World Cup and should've seen the field more.\nStarter:  Sophia Smith\nIn the squad:  Alex Morgan\nOn the bubble: Jaedyn Shaw, Mia Fishel, Ashley Hatch\nLongshot: Catarina Macario, Kristen Hamilton, Bethany Balcer\nSophia Smith has played as a winger on the USWNT, including at the World Cup, but that tournament proved Smith should be playing in front of goal. She's an elite striker in the NWSL, and asking her to play out wide means some of her best attributes don't translate and get lost. Her World Cup was bad, and you can place some of the blame on her role.\nAlex Morgan has been a great striker for the USWNT and in the NWSL, but she struggled badly at the World Cup -- her failed penalty kick in the opening game of the tournament became an omen for her first World Cup without scoring a goal. Is she still effective? Probably: she wasn't getting the best service during the World Cup. But with an eye toward the next World Cup, it might suit 34-year-old Morgan to come off the bench instead.\nThe big question is what happens when Catarina Macario comes back from injury -- she still hasn't played in a game since last year, but played as both a striker and a midfielder for the USWNT. (I'd argue with her excellent vision, service and ability on the ball, playing as a winger could suit her -- especially with a lack of wingers in the player pool with her skills.) Macario is the kind of player who needs to be on the field -- once fit, at least.\nAnother question: Should 18-year-old Jaedyn Shaw be a central attacking midfielder, or a striker? She says she prefers to be a No. 10 playmaker, but the USWNT player pool might have more room right now for another striker and, well, she's good at both. Either way, she is a player whose development is worth keeping an eye on. If the next coach goes full bore on the next generation for the Olympics, Shaw could even take Morgan's spot."}

{"title": "What's it like to be recruited by Deion Sanders? Prospects, parents give the inside scoop", "date": "2023-10-05 04:15:26", "text": "Deion Sanders is encouraged by Colorado's performance in its loss against USC and warns the Buffaloes' detractors about what's coming. (0:55)\nWHEN ADRIAN WALKER scheduled his unofficial visit to Colorado for the Week 3 game against Colorado State, he had no idea he'd be there with Lil Wayne, Master P, Offset and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\nBut that's exactly where Walker and the other recruits on campus found themselves, in what is now the new norm with Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes. It's not just locker room tours and meetings with coaches, recruits are seeing a whole different pitch from Sanders and his staff.\n\"It was crazy that Lil Wayne was right there,\" said Walker, a 2025 wide receiver recruit. \"I shook The Rock's hand and to be in that type of moment was crazy. Being that close to celebrities and being in that moment was unbelievable.\"\nThe parade of celebrities, which included musicians and hall of fame athletes, continued at Saturday's game against the USC Trojans.\n\"Deion can bring these guys out based off of him and the relationships that he has with people,\" Mantrez Walker, a 2025 linebacker recruit who visited for the USC game, said. \"A player might come back [at a different school] if he's an alumni, or he's being honored for something, but nowhere else is going to have all those guys in one place.\"\nThe first three weeks of the season -- with wins over TCU, Nebraska and Colorado State -- brought the starpower and hype to Colorado, which went 1-11 last season. The next two games -- losses to Oregon and USC -- have shown how far the roster needs to go.\nIn the three recruiting classes before Sanders' arrival, Colorado didn't finish higher than 34th in the ESPN recruiting class rankings. In two of those classes (2021, 2022), the Buffaloes did not sign an ESPN 300 prospect.\nColorado's 2024 recruiting class has eight total commitments, including two ranked in the ESPN 300 with Aaron Butler and Brandon Davis-Swain. Sanders is still trying to add to that 2024 class and make a splash by going after some big targets, including five-star Texas A&M commit Cam Coleman, who visited for the USC game. He is getting a head start in 2025, and had Mantrez Walker, ESPN Junior 300 receiver Taz Williams Jr. and ESPN Jr. 300 defensive end Christopher Burgess Jr. on campus for the game against the Trojans, as well.\nSanders has had stunning recruiting wins the past two cycles, flipping elite playmakers and using the transfer portal to bring 86 new players into the program in one offseason. When Sanders was at Jackson State from 2020-2022, he flipped five-star cornerback Travis Hunter from Florida State on national signing day in the 2022 cycle. He did it again in 2023 when he got five-star defensive back Cormani McClain to Colorado from Miami.\nRecruits from the 2024 and 2025 classes and their parents are paying attention. Not just to the hype, but to the no-nonsense, disciplinarian coach at the center of the process and the two-time consensus All-American, two-time Super Bowl winner and Pro and College Football Hall of Famer who has succeeded in every part of the sport.\n\"He makes the time to make you feel special and he puts it all on the table,\" Leon Edwards, the father of CU freshman running back Dylan Edwards, a former ESPN 300 recruit, said. \"It was a no-brainer from there, because it's just Deion is the truth and he puts the truth on the table and those kids just absorb it. They want to play for someone that has done the things that he has done and has stood on his word.\n\"I think that's where he wins.\"\nSANDERS IS FOND of saying, \"I ain't hard to find,\" when talking to recruits and detractors alike. Recruits, however, should not expect an open line to the Colorado coach.\n\"I don't think Coach Prime gives his number to any recruit, from what I know,\" Butler, a 2024 CU commit and the No. 80 prospect in the ESPN 300, told ESPN. \"It's just how he is and he doesn't want dudes just having his number. When you're playing for him, it's serious, it ain't no fandom. His job is to coach and when you get there, he's going to coach you.\"\nIf a recruit wants to talk to Sanders or he wants to talk to a recruit, an assistant coach will facilitate it. When it comes to recruiting, Sanders is as personable and hands-on as he can be, especially when recruits and families are on campus.\n\"He's just a laid-back person, he just talks about life. He said [on a visit], 'Don't lie to a kid,' and that really made my mom smile,\" ESPN 300 recruit Kamron Mikell said. \"I think recruits are drawn to him, because people see him as somebody who turns us kids into believers and he makes everyone believe in themselves.\"\nWhen Davis-Swain, a defensive end recruit, arrived at Pasta Jay's during an official visit to Colorado in June, he and his father, Brandon Davis, saw a more laid-back version of Sanders.\nPasta Jay's, a quaint 35-year-old Italian restaurant in Boulder with a sign out front that reads \"Prime for President,\" has become Sanders' go-to place for hosting recruits and their families on official visits.\nInside, Sanders and the recruits have the place to themselves. The Buffaloes' coach held court as the appetizers rolled out, followed by what seemed like unlimited pizza and pasta.\nDavis had been around Sanders briefly on the visit, but never in this relaxed, intimate setting. He didn't know what to expect and was still a little star struck, realizing he was eating dinner with Deion Sanders.\n\"It's Prime Time,\" Davis said with a big laugh.\nThese on-campus visits might be much more valuable during this recruiting cycle. After having surgery in March 2022 to have two toes amputated and part of a muscle taken out to help with circulation, Sanders had not been able to travel. Sanders had another procedure over the summer to relieve blood clots in both legs. Because of that, Colorado recruits and their families haven't been able to spend as much time in-person with Sanders.\nWhen Butler and his family took an official visit to Colorado in April, they met Sanders in a room off his personal office.\nThe room has a wall of windows overlooking Folsom Field with the mountains in the distance. Sanders typically sits in a leather chair that feels purposefully higher off the ground than where the prospects are sitting.\nThe conversations are more akin to the Pasta Jay's experience than they are the flash and extravagance. They can range from how the prospect fits on the field, what is expected of them, life lessons or sometimes just cracking jokes. And they quickly get past Sanders' celebrity.\nComplete recruiting coverage »\n2024 recruits you need to know »\nClass rankings » | ESPN 300 »\nStorylines to watch » | Latest commits »\nRecapping the 2023 recruiting cycle »\n\"It was right after they had offered me and [Sanders] pulled a couple of us [recruits] aside and had a sit-down with him for about 30 minutes,\" Talan Chandler, a three-star offensive line commit, said. \"It's Coach Prime, you're meeting with Deion Sanders and you're shell shocked, but he's just such a charismatic guy and he's super genuine. He doesn't have an ego, he doesn't think he's better than you and he makes you feel like he cares about you.\"\nThere are plenty of coaches who relate to recruits, but Sanders, according to Walker, has different qualities that differentiate him from other coaches.\n\"Having a coach who went through the recruiting process, went through the collegiate process and went to the NFL,\" Walker said. \"Being coached by a guy like that and in a place where you can be you and you can get your name out there. You can get the connections you need, you can develop, he's not afraid to play freshman and he's a player's coach.\n\"It's all those things combined.\"\nRobb-Davon and Courtney Butler, the parents of Aaron Butler, have known Sanders since Robb and Sanders played together for a season with the Baltimore Ravens. He knew Prime Time, and they didn't fully know how Sanders would be different.\n\"Make no bones about it, Coach Prime is a different man than Prime Time. Prime doesn't have anybody on his team that's like him in terms of the character Prime Time,\" Robb-Davon Butler said. \"He wouldn't have any of it. There's no way you can get away with being how he was when he was in that age or even as a pro and play for him. There is individuality, but there are no individuals above the team.\"\nSanders' attention to detail, the people he has surrounded himself with and how important every recruit seems to be is something the Butler family said they had not experienced at many other schools. When Courtney had surgery, the Colorado staff sent her cards wishing her well on the procedure, they were shocked that they even remembered the surgery was taking place let alone the date.\nDavis told Sanders about being a single father and raising his son Brandon, the struggle it has taken to get to this point and how their future could be impacted through his son getting an opportunity to play college football. Every time Davis was on campus or with Sanders, he said the two would sit as if there were no other obligations the coach needed to take care of.\nThe parents are an important part of the recruiting process for Sanders and his staff, as they are at most schools, and the staff makes it a point of emphasis to make them feel welcome, as well.\nWhile at Pasta Jay's, the families and recruits all eat, but there will be times where the parents hang back at the restaurant with some of the coaches while the recruits continue their visit or tours with players or personnel staff. Sanders and his coaches will often bring board games and playing cards and play games with the parents, talking, joking and showing that down-to-earth side that most have now experienced.\n​​\"Deion could go host the Grammy's or he can come sit in your backyard at a family barbecue,\" Omar Stoutmire, the father of 2023 Colorado signee Carter Stoutmire, said. \"You'd be shocked at how down to earth he is, he's like a chameleon.\"\nWHILE SANDERS EMBRACES the hype of being Prime Time for outsiders, something is different inside the program, according to recruits.\n\"His principles, like if you're talking to him and you're slouching, he'll make you sit up and he'll get on you,\" Chandler said. \"He holds everything to a top standard and there's just something about that, that's very, I'd say attractive to a recruit.\n\"Like, that's excellence right there.\"\nSanders tells recruits to sit up or tuck in their shirts. Cursing isn't allowed and Sanders tells players to take off their hats, something Colorado State coach Jay Norvell criticized Sanders about. The players who can deal with those standards are the ones who stick around. The players who don't will know up front that Sanders won't let anything slide just because they're a five-star or an instant-impact transfer.\nWhen Sanders flipped McClain from Miami in the last recruiting cycle, it was a big win for the program and Sanders at the last minute. McClain, however, did not play in the first three games of the season before playing late in the blowout loss to the Oregon Ducks and most of the USC game, where he broke up a pass in the end zone.\nAfter the Oregon game, Sanders was asked what McClain could do to see more playing time.\n\"Study. Prepare. Be on time for meetings. Show up to the dern meetings. Understand what we're doing as a scheme,\" Sanders said. \"Want to play this game. Desire to play this game. Desire to be the best in this game at practice, in the film room and on your own free time.\"\nSanders preaches the same accountability in the recruiting process and doesn't promise anything to prospects.\n\"Oftentimes when coaches recruit, the recruits come in and the recruits are interviewing the coaches. We're interviewing the recruits to make sure you have the intangibles,\" Sanders said on \"College GameDay.\" \"Smart, tough, fast, disciplined with character. But not only that, that you love the game. You've got an affinity and passion for the game.\"\nButler was recruited by major programs, including Alabama, Georgia, Miami, Oregon, Washington. He saw the accountability and character as a differentiator and something that attracted him even more to what Sanders was building.\n\"​​Just being around [Sanders] when I was up there and then through the recruiting process, you can see the main goal and the main thing is winning and, before anything else, getting the right dudes in there,\" Butler said. \"He's not going to let you slack off or slouch in front of him. He's going to make sure you're ready to perform and perform at the level that you're expected to.\"\nIt wasn't always that way, though, as Butler took a visit to Colorado in March before the mass offseason exodus that saw 47 players enter the portal during the spring transfer window in April. Butler wasn't impressed with the talent on the field and wasn't sure Colorado would be the place where he could compete against the best and achieve his goals.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nHe came home from the visit with the feeling he could have started immediately on that roster. When he saw Sanders turning over the roster and bringing in more talent, he was excited about what that would mean for the future and for his recruitment.\n\"Being in that environment, I get to prove myself and it's a great opportunity because in a room with the right type of dudes pushing me, the type of dudes they have right now,\" Butler said. \"I'm looking at going there and competing with the top [players], so just having the opportunity to work with Travis Hunter and get better with him and push him to get better, it's a beautiful thing. If you're somebody, you're not going to sit on the back of the porch and want to play with the little pups, you gotta jump out there and really show what it is to everybody right off the rip.\"\nIt's that mentality Sanders is searching for. By being strict and sticking to who he is during the recruiting process, he's targeting prospects with a similar mentality.\nWhile Colorado's 2024 class has just three four-star commits, Sanders and his staff still have time until the early signing period in late December as well as the transfer portal periods to add to the class. Sanders might even flip another high-profile recruit like he has done in the past two classes.\nColeman visited Colorado for the USC game despite his commitment to the Aggies. He's the No. 8 prospect overall and would be a third five-star to flip to the program if Sanders is able to pull it off. Colorado is also heavily recruiting five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood, the top prospect in the 2025 class. Underwood visited Colorado for the Colorado State game.\nThese are the kinds of players Sanders will need to land to turn Colorado from the best show in college football to a legit contender. Those already on board won't bet against him.\n\"He's charismatic and genuine and the people that he brings around him are all the same, they all just have that love and passion for football,\" Chandler said. \"He's building a culture and brings a championship mindset around him. To be recruited by him, as he tells you, we're coming here to win championships. This is what we want, we want excellence here.\""}
{"title": "After a massive shake-up, what lies ahead for the Bucks, Celtics and the East's best?", "date": "2023-10-05 04:22:45", "text": "Stephen A. Smith discusses his expectations for the Bucks this season after acquiring Damian Lillard. (1:03)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season kicks off Monday, when media day marks the start of training camp for 28 of the 30 teams across the league. (The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves kicked off their camps on Thursday.)\nThat includes all 15 Eastern Conference teams, some of which are still reeling from the seismic trades of Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks and, after a few days as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, Jrue Holiday to the Boston Celtics.\nWhat are the deals' ripple effects throughout the conference? What could they mean for the future of another star guard, the Philadelphia 76ers' James Harden? Are there more moves on the horizon for the Bucks and Celtics? What's next for the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers after mostly standing pat this offseason?\nAs camps get underway, here's a quick trip around the East, looking at the five biggest questions among the top contenders for home-court advantage in the conference.\nFor all of the attention surrounding the Bucks and Celtics for their blockbuster trades, those completed deals now push Harden's uncertain future to the forefront.\nThis summer, Harden made his feelings clear about Daryl Morey, Philadelphia's president of basketball operations and Harden's longtime ally and advocate going back to successful seasons together with the Houston Rockets. These days, though, there seems to be little love for Morey from Harden.\nNow that Lillard and Holiday are off the board, it's difficult to see the kind of star player coming back to Philadelphia that Morey has publicly declared would be required for Harden to be dealt. Until either Morey changes his stance or some team meets his terms, Harden's lone path to being paid this season is by playing for the 76ers.\nSo, how will Harden react? Will he be fully committed? Is there a world where he could remain in Philadelphia for the entire season?\nAll of these questions, and others, will be asked of Harden on Monday at the team's media day at its practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, and then in the days to come during the team's training camp in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nHarden can be asked those questions only if he actually shows up.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey and coach Nick Nurse address James Harden's absence from media day and his trade request.\nMeanwhile, the 76ers will be adjusting to life under a new coach, former Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse, and it's safe to say the league's reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, registered his feelings about the summer by tweeting Sunday afternoon, \"This offseason was fun lmao.\"\nFor a Philadelphia franchise that has been consumed by virtually constant drama for a decade, there will be no shortage of it in the coming weeks.\nThe Heat never think they are out of options when it comes to acquiring talent, a hard-earned belief from nearly three decades of team president Pat Riley's tenure lording over the franchise.\nBut it's hard to argue this summer has been anything but a disappointment for the reigning East champs. Miami attempted to acquire Damian Lillard -- the exact kind of ball-dominant guard who would have been a perfect fit alongside Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.\nHoliday, while not Lillard from an offensive standpoint, is the type of tough-minded two-way player the Heat have always gravitated toward throughout Riley's tenure and would have fit seamlessly next to Butler on the perimeter.\nInstead, the Heat's chief competition -- the Bucks and Celtics -- landed the star guards, and two key players from last season's stunning playoff run -- Gabe Vincent and Max Strus -- signed with the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively, in free agency.\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nThe Heat, who pride themselves on getting contributions from unheralded role players, did bring back Josh Richardson on a team-friendly deal to replace Vincent, will be moving Duncan Robinson into Strus' role as a floor spacer and scorer -- one he occupied before Strus stepped into it over the past season-plus -- and will look for contributions from second-year forward Nikola Jovic and rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr., two of the players who could've gone out in a deal for a guard who instead wound up staying put.\nMiami should remain in the hunt for any stars who become available. But this summer was a short-term setback. And while doubting either Jimmy Butler or coach Erik Spoelstra should be done at one's peril, Miami's road to a fourth conference finals in five seasons got a lot tougher over the past week.\nBetween the Bucks swinging for the fences with Lillard and the Celtics doing the same with Holiday, it's been a wild week atop the East.\nIn Milwaukee, there might not be a better one-two punch in the NBA, in terms of star power, than Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. The duo should help the Bucks' offense skyrocket up league rankings after finishing 15th last season (albeit with three-time All-Star forward Khris Middleton missing most of the season with injuries).\nBrian Windhorst explains why the Milwaukee Bucks are under tremendous pressure to win an NBA championship to keep Giannis Antetokounmpo.\nMilwaukee's perimeter defense, eighth in the league last season in opponent 3-point percentage, takes a significant step back with the loss of Holiday, arguably the NBA's best two-way guard.\nBoston, on the other hand, started the offseason by sending Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of a three-team trade to land Kristaps Porzingis and ended it with another massive swing in getting Holiday.\nThe Celtics enter training camp with arguably the best top six in the league -- Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Al Horford, Porzingis and Holiday -- but the overflow of talent leaves questions over whether Horford or White will be the one to come off the bench.\nThe four others, however, figure to end virtually every game on the court together, and give Boston arguably an unmatched level of versatility.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nBeyond its top six, Boston's roster is littered with either lower-paid or inexperienced options for second-year coach Joe Mazzulla. Horford and Porzingis, the team's two stretch big men, come with durability concerns, given Horford is 37 and Porzingis has played 65 or more games only three times in nine NBA seasons.\nAnd while the Celtics still have all but one of their future firsts to put in deals even after getting Holiday, they don't have much salary to put together to make a deal to upgrade the roster.\nBy the time the Celtics and Bucks meet for the first time on Nov. 22 in Boston (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN), we'll have a lot more of an idea of what these groups look like. As of now, though, these two teams appear poised to be on a playoff collision course for the fourth time in the past seven seasons.\nAfter a five-year playoff absence, it was a rough return for Cleveland, which lost in five games to the New York Knicks as the higher-seeded team -- including twice on its home court. Throughout that first-round series, the Cavaliers looked severely hampered by their lack of postseason experience, as well as really bothered by their lack of perimeter shooting, as New York sagged far off poor-shooting options like forward Isaac Okoro throughout the series.\nThe Cavaliers made it a priority to address their shooting deficiencies this offseason, signing Max Strus from the Heat and Georges Niang from the 76ers. Both of them will give Cleveland a lot more offensive versatility and should prevent the Cavaliers from returning to the rotating cast of characters who struggled to adequately fill the fifth spot on the court last season alongside the quartet of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen.\nThe duo's presence also should allow Cleveland more versatility to play small, something the Cavs didn't have an easy way to do last season.\nThe overarching question for this season in Cleveland, however, surrounds Mitchell, and whether Cleveland can do enough to convince the four-time All-Star to agree to a contract extension next summer, when he will be one year away from free agency.\nDoing so begins with improving on last season's first-round flop. Strus and Niang were brought in to play a part in that. Another factor will be the offensive development of Mobley, who has quickly become a dominant force defensively but is still a ways away from the two-way star Cleveland will need to contend with the likes of Milwaukee and Boston.\nIt was another relatively quiet offseason for the Knicks, who made a shrewd pickup to land Donte DiVincenzo as a free agent, pairing him with Villanova teammates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart.\nBut standing pat made sense. New York had a breakthrough last season, beating Cleveland to reach the second round of the playoffs behind the play of last year's home run free agent signing in Brunson, and giving hope to the legions of Knicks fans in the tristate area that a brighter future might finally be around the corner.\nNew York is still waiting, however, for the moment when it can push in its chips for the right player. The Knicks chose not to do so with Mitchell last summer. They didn't with Beal, Lillard or Holiday this year.\nBut what if someone like Antetokounmpo or Embiid becomes available next summer? What if Cleveland struggles and Mitchell, a year away from free agency, makes it clear he won't stay?\nIf a disgruntled superstar suddenly becomes available via trade, the Knicks, between their combination of draft assets and players under contract, are positioned to make an enticing offer.\nIn the meantime, if the Knicks can build on the momentum they've created with their play last season -- their playoff series win was the franchise's first since 2013 -- the appeal of playing home games inside Madison Square Garden could return."}
{"title": "Overheard on NBA media day: New-look Bucks, LeBron's understudy and ... a green alien?", "date": "2023-10-05 04:22:45", "text": "Grizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman speaks about the significance of Ja Morant being allowed to travel with the team during his 25-game suspension. (0:55)\nThe 2023-24 NBA season is just weeks away, and as the players and coaches prepare for training camp, our NBA insiders are breaking down some of the biggest things we overheard from this season's media days.\nThe San Antonio Spurs' highly anticipated rookie, Victor Wembanyama, is no stranger to the media as the first overall pick prepares for his first NBA training camp amid expectations he will help lead San Antonio alongside Jeremy Sochan, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson.\nOther teams got to introduce their biggest offseason additions. The Milwaukee Bucks debuted recently acquired seven-time All-Star Damian Lillard alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez.\nThere are still some organizations with serious questions to address heading into the season. The Boston Celtics will face some growing pains with a revamped coaching staff on top of the offseason additions of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday. The Memphis Grizzlies, who grabbed media attention for all the wrong reasons last season, will be confronted with questions about navigating Ja Morant's 25-game suspension for conduct detrimental to the league.\nAnd most notably, the Philadelphia 76ers will try to manage the drama surrounding James Harden, who did not attend media day as he continues to seek a trade.\nHere's what players, coaches and teams are talking about as media day kicked off across the league.\nJump to a team:\nBOS | DEN | DET | GS | LAC\nLAL | MEM | MIL | PHI | SA\nLike everywhere else around the league, it had a lot of \"first day of school\" energy. There also was a healthy dose of optimism about contending with a roster that includes the reigning MVP, Joel Embiid, a championship coach in Nick Nurse and versatile veteran talent.\nBut the specter of James Harden's absence -- and when or if the disgruntled point guard will return to the team -- hovered over it all.\nIt made for a confusing scene that likely won't get much clearer as the team shifts to Colorado State's campus in Fort Collins, Colorado, for training camp the rest of this week.\n76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey opened his presser by declaring the team needs to be given time to prove it can achieve its lofty expectations. Embiid, meanwhile, questioned an assertion that Milwaukee and Boston had \"surpassed\" the 76ers with their acquisitions of Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday, respectively.\n\"You can do whatever you want off the court,\" Embiid said, \"but you still gotta go out there and put the ball in the hoop. I believe that any team that I'm on, we're always going to have a chance.\"\nNo one had any idea when Harden would return.\nInstead, those questions were met with shrugs or hope that last year's NBA assists leader would return to the fold.\n\"That ain't for me to answer,\" 76ers forward P.J. Tucker said. \"I hope they figure it out soon. But if not, it's going to be what it's going to be.\"\nUnlike the Ben Simmons situation two years ago, there is seemingly no animosity between Harden and his teammates, which is partly why the 76ers believe there's a path to him returning to the court. The fact there's no obvious trade partner for Harden doesn't hurt, either.\nBut it's also clear that, without Harden, the 76ers have little chance of keeping up with the East's elite. It's a task that will be difficult even if he does eventually rejoin Philadelphia's ranks.\n-- Tim Bontemps\nLess than a week after being traded for the first time in his 11-year NBA career, reality was still setting in for Damian Lillard, the Milwaukee Buck.\nBut it was easy for him to get excited about his new running mate, two-time MVP and 2021 Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, and all the ways they would make life easier for each other on the court. It's the first time either player, both named to the NBA's list of the top 75 players of all time, will play alongside another superstar.\n\"My whole career has been off-the-dribble 3s, pick-and-roll pull-up 3s, contested [shots]. Double-teamed. Trapped,\" Lillard said. \"I'm curious to see how that can be possible with a player as dominant as [Antetokounmpo] is. I'm excited for an opportunity to play with him. I'm excited for the opportunity to be freed up and the opportunity to have more space and opportunity to play. It's going to be fun.\"\nThe gang takes their first group photo 📸 pic.twitter.com/sIDCbBZmCk\nLillard and Antetokounmpo have long admired each other from afar -- Antetokounmpo made Lillard the No.1 pick during the 2023 All-Star draft -- but what struck them both following their first phone conversation after the trade was how similar their personalities were.\nAntetokounmpo said it was like they were both the same person, if different sizes.\nSo even though this pairing comes with heightened expectations, both stars are approaching the season in similar fashion.\n\"We got to stay locked in,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There's going to be so much hype around us, lot more TV games, lot of conversation about us. But at the end of the day, you don't win a championship by making a move.\"\nAdded Lillard: \"It made me feel good to see that he thinks that way.\"\n-- Jamal Collier\nThe Celtics spent the past three months getting used to a new normal. There was a total change in locker room voices with Marcus Smart and Grant Williams departing. Joe Mazzulla replaced most of his coaching staff. The arrival of Kristaps Porzingis was a planned adjustment to playing with two big men on the floor most of the time.\nThen, boom, Jrue Holiday got traded 24 hours before the start of media day and the snow globe was shaken up again. Down the line, Celtics players were excited about the deal and praised what they know about Holiday, but there was no doubt the team was a little rocked by the adjustment to the adjustment.\nFor example, guard Derrick White talked about how new assistant coach Sam Cassell came to Colorado this summer to spend some time getting to know him and preparing him for taking over as starting point guard -- and then Boston acquired a new All-Star point guard.\nPorzingis had been in Boston for two weeks working out and getting to know big man Robert Williams III, a defensive anchor whom Porzingis was preparing to play a lot with -- and now will not.\n\"I already could see how Rob is that charismatic guy for this group,\" he said. \"So it definitely hurts for this organization that he's not here anymore.\"\nMazzulla doesn't seem sure what his starting lineup or his rotations will be yet. The team has two roster spots open and is now hunting for another player, likely a big man. Holiday is living out of a suitcase.\nThe Celtics have great promise, but this might take a little time.\n-- Brian Windhorst\nSince 1999, the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers have shared the same downtown venue -- formerly Staples Center, currently Crypto.com Arena. But that partnership ends after this season, as the Clippers' new arena, the Intuit Dome located in Inglewood, is slated to open just before the 2024-25 season. Clippers star Paul George, for one, is eager for the switch.\n\"Yeah, I'm ready for us to have our own space,\" he said during Clippers media day Monday. \"I think I can speak to the whole [team] of saying we're tired of all these early games, and so it'd be nice [for] the schedule be a little bit in our favor.\"\nGeorge was referencing how the Clippers are often described as the \"third tenant\" at Crypto.com Arena, behind the Lakers and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, meaning that their schedule has often been sorted out after those of the other teams, which has led to plenty of early-morning tipoffs in the Clippers' schedule. (In 2016, ESPN reported that the Clippers' lease agreement meant that they not only have a lesser say in scheduling but receive a smaller share of proceeds from suites and club seats than the Lakers and Kings.)\nPouring the concrete floor 💪Over 20,000 sq. feet of concrete has been poured to lay the foundation for Intuit Dome's main basketball court and floor pic.twitter.com/yeQpo6I9iA\nClippers players and coaches have railed about this arrangement for years. That said, George said it has been a pleasure to play in Crypto.com Arena, given that it's the same building where Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, whom George admired for years, once played.\n\"It's been awesome, but that was short-lived,\" he said. \"Now, that I've been here for a couple of years, [I'm] not looking forward to the early games. So, again, it'd be nice to have our own space next year.\"\n-- Baxter Holmes\nDerrick Rose delivered a simple message during a recent conversation with Ja Morant:\n\"I'm not here to babysit you. I'm not here to follow you around. I'm not here to cheerlead. ... I'm here to push you.\"\nRose's potential to serve as a mentor to Morant, who will practice and travel with the team while serving a 25-game suspension to start the season, was among the factors that made him attractive to the Grizzlies. The 34-year-old Rose has a résumé that commands respect -- highlighted by the 2010-11 MVP award -- and a level of wisdom gained through a 15-year career that has featured plenty of trials and tribulations, both on and off the court.\nBut Rose didn't sign a veteran's deal to return to Memphis, where he played his lone college season before getting selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 draft, to assume the responsibility of preventing Morant from sabotaging his career with continued off-court foolishness.\nGrizzlies general manager Zach Kleiman speaks about the significance of Ja Morant being allowed to travel with the team during his 25-game suspension.\nHe's happy to give advice if Morant is willing to hear it -- such as emphasizing the importance of having the \"discipline to remind yourself or be mindful of the places you're at, who you're with and your actions\" -- but Rose's focus is on the basketball floor.\nRose, who played only 27 games for the New York Knicks last season, believes he still has \"a lot left in the tank\" and looks forward to being able to prove it. He will have a chance to get significant minutes with the Grizzlies, especially early in the season while Morant is unavailable. Rose also anticipates being able to help Morant rise to new levels as a point guard whose high-flying style is reminiscent of Rose's before his career-altering knee injury. \"I'm very fortunate to be in this situation where a lot of people look at his game, they kind of compare our games together, but he's on a whole another level,\" Rose said. \"So really seeing that it's our job to push him and let him know in times whenever he's being reckless to calm down.\"\nA few seconds later, Rose interrupted another question with a clarification: \"When we saying reckless, I'm talking about on the court, guys. On the court.\"\n-- Tim MacMahon\nAfter countless hours spent this summer working out alongside LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura was a little taken aback when he saw how small he looked compared to James when the team posted snapshots on social media.\n\"My weight was fine,\" Hachimura said with a chuckle at the Lakers' annual media day Monday. \"But they put the picture next to [LeBron].\" While Hachimura admitted that his body might be more \"defined\" since we last saw him in May when the Lakers were being swept out of the Western Conference finals by the Denver Nuggets, he is planning to punish opponents in the paint much the same way James has mastered.\n\"I just watched him closely and he taught me a lot of little tricks, pointers, the footwork.\" Hachimura said of the joint workouts organized by Lakers assistant coach Phil Handy.\nAs the 38-year-old James enters his 21st season, some drop-off in production from the lofty standard he has set for himself is expected, if not inevitable. But by pouring his knowledge into Hachimura in the summertime, it could mean Hachimura will be better equipped to support him as a teammate during the season.\n\"I see a lot in him,\" James said of Hachimura. \"I call him my Daniel-san and I'm Mr. Miyagi. And I call him my understudy.\"\nHachimura already showed signs of being ready for a starring role last postseason. He opened up the playoffs with 29 points on 11-for-14 shooting against the Grizzlies to help L.A. steal Game 1 of their first-round series on the road.\nHe stayed hot through L.A.'s playoff run, averaging 12.2 points on 55.7/48.7/88.2 shooting splits -- a significant uptick from his efficiency during the regular season after being acquired in a trade with the Washington Wizards in January.\nNow armed with a three-year, $51 million contract extension signed in the offseason, Hachimura is ready for more with the Lakers. Be it as a starter, as James' backup or whatever else he's asked to do -- like when he played some minutes at the 5 against Nikola Jokic in the Denver series.\n\"Playing time is more important for me,\" Hachimura said, \"and I want to finish the game. That's my main thing. And whatever the coaches decide, I'm here for it.\"\n-- Dave McMenamin\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray sat down, reunited not only with each other after the shortest offseason of their pro careers but also with the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\nIt didn't take the Nuggets stars long to get on the same wavelength yet again.\n\"I just think we can do it again,\" Murray said.\nJokic later added: \"Like Jamal said, why not win again?\"\nRepeating will be even more difficult for Jokic and Murray than bringing Denver its first NBA title. Not only have other contenders like Milwaukee, Phoenix and Boston reloaded, but Denver will have to offset its own locker room losses.\nNuggets head coach Michael Malone has sky-high expectations for Jamal Murray entering the 2023-24 season 🌟 #NBAMediaDay pic.twitter.com/Tt45GngfDs\nAlready, coach Michael Malone has challenged his two stars. He wants to see Jokic and Murray take \"ownership\" of the team with vocal vets like Jeff Green and Ish Smith gone.\nAnd he wants to see Murray take his postseason tear and apply it to the entire upcoming regular season and become a first-time All-Star and All-NBA performer. Murray averaged 26.1 points, 7.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds and shot 39.6% from 3 last postseason.\nIf his two stars do that, Malone might find himself trying to top his parade performance next June.\n\"Last season is over,\" Malone said. \"If we're serious about being a team that can repeat, if we're serious about trying to be a team that can be a dynasty, we have to bring our best every single day starting [Tuesday] in practice.\"\n-- Ohm Youngmisuk\nAfter a league-worst 17-65 finish last season, Detroit Pistons GM Troy Weaver says he feels the team is \"ready to go\" and compete for a playoff spot.\nWeaver says \"there was never any excuses\" for the lack of success, but he feels like the Pistons are better with the addition of new head coach Monty Williams and the return of former No. 1 pick Cade Cunningham, who missed all but a dozen games last season after undergoing surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left leg.\nA special message from Deuce! pic.twitter.com/ppdIsCSXin\nWhile examining the Eastern Conference landscape in the aftermath of the star player movement such as Lillard's trade to Milwaukee, Weaver doesn't feel that changes the goal in Detroit, which is to return to basketball relevance after finishing .500 or worse in seven consecutive seasons.\n\"I like what Boston and Milwaukee and the rest of those teams do. That's more fuel to what we're trying to do. Realistic goal for our team? Is to play 82 meaningful games,\" Weaver said during media day.\n\"We want to go down to the wire every game with us playing for something. We don't want to just look at the last 25 games and not be in contention. We want to be in contention for 82 games, the entire season.\"\n-- Eric Woodyard\nOn the final day the San Antonio Spurs occupied their old facility on 1 Spurs Lane, about a dozen fans stood outside the players exit hoping for an autograph. They were holding the typical items you'd see, such as basketballs and jerseys.\nBut with 2023 No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama in town, there was a new offering awaiting Wembanyama's signature: a 6-foot green inflatable alien wearing a black Spurs Wembanyama jersey.\nWembanyama, who LeBron James called \"an alien\" last year and who Nike dubbed \"The Extraterrestrial\" in a new ad, has taken San Antonio by storm ever since the Spurs won the draft lottery in May.\nSpurs rookie Victor Wembanyama discusses how he's prepared for his first season in the league and what he's looking forward to most in the NBA.\nThere are murals going up around town, including one Wembanyama posed in front of in his latest Instagram post in which he declares himself a \"Certified San Antonian.\"\n\"Man, it's just been so comfortable to have people welcome you like this, and I'm very thankful,\" Wembanyama said Monday. \"I'm a very lucky, lucky human.\"\nNot only has Wembanyama started to acclimate himself to his new city, but he also has done so with his new teammates.\n\"We often have team dinners and team meetings, so I'm really glad everything's happening the way it's happening,\" Wembanyama said. \"And yes, as I was saying, I feel very lucky. I know I'm in a good environment from every aspect.\"\n-- Andrew Lopez\nThe Golden State Warriors have become synonymous with small ball, and with the addition of guard Chris Paul and the possibility he could be a starter, the Warriors could have the smallest starting lineup in the NBA.\nThat being said, would they want more options with size? Draymond Green has heard that before.\n\"They said we didn't have enough size in 2022, and we won,\" Green said Monday. \"I've been told I wasn't the right size forever, and I've won. ...\n\"I can show you where we didn't have enough size and we won. In saying that, I'm not totally against having another big.\"\nThe Warriors brought in Dwight Howard for a set of workouts a few weeks ago, but nothing materialized. Golden State did add Usman Garuba on a two-way contract and Rudy Gay on a non-guaranteed training camp deal to add some more size.\nChris Paul says he'll do \"whatever to help our team win\" as he heads into his first season with the Warriors.\nThe two players will surely get more run time in the preseason with Green sidelined for at least the next two weeks with a left ankle sprain -- but the Warriors still don't have a traditional center to back up Kevon Looney.\n\"At the end of the day, I think [Warriors GM] Mike Dunleavy has done an incredible job of filling impossible shoes,\" Green said. \"The No. 1 thing that Mike has to do is come in and create trust with every move that he's been making and moves that he hasn't made. But communicating with us and making sure we're in the know -- that we know certain things -- is incredible.\"\nGreen reiterated the Warriors don't need another big, stating anything they need they already have. But he had a small caveat:\n\"[The] Lakers are huge. That's who we lost to. So if you look at someone and you're like, 'This is who we lost to, where do we need to improve?' Probably need a little bit more size. Doesn't mean we're necessarily going to lose again if we don't get the size. But it may help.\"\n-- Kendra Andrews"}

But Lynch bluntly said he isn't the right person to ask due to his relationship with both parties.\nA post shared by ESPN (@espn)\nCandidly, Lynch said he respects Wilson as a player and a teammate.\n\"I'll take Russ and I'll put him at quarterback and I'll rock with him because I've done that,\" he said.\nBut, according to Lynch, anything he says might be taken with malice because of the fallout from the goal-line interception Wilson threw in Super Bowl XLIX that led to the Seahawks' 28-24 defeat to the New England Patriots and contributed to Wilson's eventual departure for the Denver Broncos. In terms of a relationship, Lynch said, he and Wilson didn't have one off the field.\n\"Can't pick up the phone or call old boy or nothing,\" Lynch said.\nThe aftermath of a game against the Tennessee Titans in 2013 stood out to Lynch when reflecting on his relationship with Wilson.\nLynch said the Titans didn't have a good secondary at the time; therefore, the plan was to exploit the pass defense. Wilson didn't have the game that he wanted, throwing for 257 yards and no touchdowns.\nAccording to Lynch, he asked the team's player personnel staff for Wilson's number to offer support. The staff member promised to look into it and later called Lynch back to see if he got a call from Wilson. Lynch responded that he hadn't spoken with Wilson, but he had received a phone call with caller ID blocked.\n\"I don't know how or why [it was blocked], but I just know I got a call from a blocked number,\" Lynch said.\nLynch and Wilson eventually spoke, but the conversation didn't go the way Lynch expected. He said he tried to let Wilson know he \"had his back,\" but Wilson's response surprised Lynch.\n\"Considering that [we're] on the same team, going for the same goal and this is how you chose to respond to me,\" he recalled. \"It was more so like, maybe you don't understand what I'm saying?\"\nLater in the podcast, Lynch cited preferential treatment from Carroll to Wilson as a reason for tension within the team. \"You're kind of putting him on a pedestal or outside the box,\" Lynch said. \"And it's like he doesn't have to be held accountable to the same s--- that we do.\"\nLynch and Wilson were teammates in Seattle for four full seasons, winning Super Bowl XLVIII. Lynch briefly returned to the Seahawks in 2019 for one game.\nWilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 after 10 years with the Seahawks."}

{"title": "Experts: What Brett Favre faces in lawsuit deposition", "date": "2023-10-05 11:58:53", "text": "On the one-year anniversary of Brett Favre being named in a civil suit, here's a look back at the Hall of Famer's involvement in the largest welfare scandal in the history of the state. (3:15)\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services filed notice this week of its intent to depose former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. More than a year ago, Favre was named as one of dozens of defendants in a civil lawsuit that aims to recover tens of millions of dollars in welfare funds a state audit said were misspent. Favre has denied any wrongdoing in the welfare case and has not been criminally charged.\nThe deposition, scheduled for Oct. 26, would be Favre's first time testifying under oath in this case, according to Front Office Sports. The people involved in the case aren't commenting because of a judge's gag order, but several unaffiliated attorneys explained what could happen when Favre arrives at the deposition in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where Favre starred for the University of Southern Mississippi.\nESPN spoke with William W. Berry III, a law professor at the University of Mississippi; Vangela M. Wade, an attorney and leader of the Mississippi Center for Justice; and Matthew Leish, a partner at the law firm Miller Korzenik Sommers Rayman in New York. The legal experts addressed, among other things, the risks that Favre potentially faces during the deposition process, and what he could do to help his case. All three said they do not know details of the case beyond what has been reported and would speak about general legal strategies. Here are their responses, which have been edited for clarity.\nWhat does it mean to be deposed?\nBerry: The idea of a deposition is to get someone's story on the record so that, at trial, they can't change it later. And so it'll obviously be very important for Brett Favre to tell the truth. This is his chance to get his story on the record.\nWade: In any deposition, it's part of discovery, of getting information directly from that person that they're deposing, or having that person to identify documents during the course of that deposition.\nLeish: There are really two goals. One, it's fact gathering. They're trying to find out what this person knows. The second part of it is to try to pin him down to get some admissions that will hurt his case. It can't be a complete fishing expedition, but they have some leeway to explore.\nHow long do depositions last?\nWade: I've seen depositions go anywhere from an hour to three days or longer for one person. It depends on the nature of the litigation and what the party is attempting to cover in that deposition.\nBerry: Most depositions are usually one-day depositions, maybe eight hours. In a more complicated case, it might take longer.\nWhat kinds of risks does Favre face during the deposition?\nLeish: The biggest danger is that he says something under oath that really helps the state prove its case. Maybe he admits something that they're trying to prove or he says something and they can call him out on it and it makes him look like he's not credible. I think those are the two biggest risks.\nHow can a deposition be used as evidence in a potential trial?\nBerry: If the plaintiffs in the case were to call Mr. Favre to testify and then he were to change his story on the stand, you would then cite him back to his deposition and impeach him in court. An impeachment is really showing someone's changing their story and then the credibility that person has with a jury or a judge is shot.\nWhat would help Favre in his deposition?\nLeish: When you're the person being deposed, it's really defensive. You're trying not to give the other side anything they can use. It's not so much that you're trying to prove your case. So his main goal is don't hurt yourself.\nBut having said that, if his testimony is very consistent with what he's saying -- \"I didn't do anything wrong, here's what I knew\" -- and he backs that up, he's got real evidence to support that, it can be useful to him. And the state can say, \"Hold on a second here, maybe we have a problem. Maybe we're going to have a hard time proving our case.\"\nBerry: What discovery is, is really a negotiation on some level in the sense of each party is trying to marshal, each lawyer is trying to figure out the best they can what really happened. So often you see these disputes in the media and you have the \"he said and she said,\" but then you start drilling down and you look at the actual evidence in the case and what evidence do you have and putting the evidence together.\nThen you get a sense of, \"Wow, this person really did something they weren't supposed to.\" Or alternatively, \"The allegation, it looked that way, but this person actually didn't do anything wrong.\""}
{"title": "Untold stories of the Air Raid revolution, from pregame hot dogs to Phil Collins photo ops", "date": "2023-10-05 12:16:40", "text": "Long before the world knew Mike Leach or Dana Holgorsen or any of the other oddballs, eccentrics and revolutionaries of the Air Raid fraternity, Hal Mumme was a high school coach in Copperas Cove, Texas, with a problem.\nIt was 1986, the NBA and a young superstar had captured the attention of the school's best athletes. Even Mumme's own son came home from school one day and announced he wanted to be Michael Jordan.\nThis was Texas, and most coaches still romanticized the notion that football had to be torture for it to be worthwhile. There was a machismo to the running game, ramming head-on into each other and surviving battles of attrition, with defenses built around big, physical players meant to win those battles.\n\"My generation's football coaches fought World War II,\" Mumme said, \"and they were pretty damn determined to make us relive it every day in practice.\"\nSo Mumme, who had already gone from being the nation's youngest coordinator at UTEP at 27, was now 31, looking to reboot his career after the Miners' whole staff had been fired, and he had a wild idea. What if he made football fun? What if he actually used the entire field?\nAnd so the beginnings of the Air Raid were born, 67 miles away from Austin, where just 10 years before, Texas coach Darrell Royal was running the wishbone and repeating his maxim: \"Three things can happen to you whenever you throw the football, and two of 'em are bad.\" But Mumme, who idolized Royal, realized that the same thing that made the wishbone work, spreading the ball in space to skilled athletes, might work even better as a passing offense. So he went all-in.\nA decade later, Mumme burst onto the national scene at Kentucky, walking around on SEC fields, eating hot dogs, wearing flip-flops and listening to Jimmy Buffet before becoming the only UK coach in the past 100 years to beat Alabama. His creation made 5-9 slot receivers superstars and walk-on quarterbacks Heisman winners. Mumme made it possible for Mike Leach, a lawyer from Pepperdine, to become a college football icon, for Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech walk-on himself from tiny Muleshoe, Texas, to lead two of the most storied programs in history. He made football interesting for unpedigreed coaches who loved the sport, but who would rather write books about Geronimo than sleep in their offices or run the damn ball.\n\"The Air Raid is not an offense,\" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"The Air Raid is a way of life.\"\n\"It's a mentality,\" Riley said, \"more than a collection of plays.\"\nThese mavericks changed the course of football history and rewrote record books, paving the way for Patrick Mahomes to win two Super Bowls while forcing Bill Belichick and Nick Saban to give into wide-open passing attacks. How they did it was never boring.\nLast year, Dykes, a former Mumme assistant at Kentucky, made a historic run to the national title game after a 5-7 season. This year Deion Sanders, who used to pick Mumme's brain and called Leach for offensive staff recommendations, is using the same wide-open principles at Colorado during its program jump-start, turning his own son, Shedeur, into a Heisman candidate at QB.\nWith the sport still mourning Leach, the most famous and revered coach in the extended Air Raid family, following his death in December, we set out to find tales from the rise of the game-changing offense that illustrate the methods behind their collective madness.\nFor every Tim Couch or Kyler Murray or Caleb Williams, the bluest of blue-chip prospects, there are dozens of record-setting Air Raid quarterbacks who were unwanted by anyone else, then ran up the gaudiest of numbers.\nDustin Dewald blazed the trail in Copperas Cove. He was one of those players who got disillusioned with the drudgery of football in the 1980s, so he quit to join the golf team after watching his older brother get pummeled over and over as their QB.\n\"We got our heads kicked in trying to run the ball down the throats of bigger, more powerful teams, lining up in the Power I with an offensive line that averaged 195 pounds,\" Dewald said. \"It was just ridiculous. Hal came in and said, 'All that's going to change.' It did. I think it was the first time in 10 years we didn't have a losing season in Cove.\"\nBetween 1978 and 1985, Cove went 10-69, including two 0-10 seasons. In Mumme's first year in 1986, the Bulldogs went 5-5. They were still outmanned, but Mumme, who began by using the run and shoot, gave them a shot in every game. Then against district rival Georgetown, the opposing coach, Art Briles, blitzed Mumme relentlessly, making it difficult for more complex plays to develop.\n\"I decided I was never going to let that happen to me again,\" Mumme said, reducing his offense to a collection of short passes and horizontal crossing routes.\nDewald threw the ball more than all but a handful of schools in Texas that year. There had been only two scholarship players in the previous 10 years at Cove, but he signed with Stephen F. Austin. Then, he went through the same cycle, quitting due to boredom and joining the golf team at Tarleton State. There weren't any college teams he knew of where he could replicate his experience. Until he went home to Cove to visit.\nHe stopped by the football offices to congratulate Mumme on his new job he'd just landed at a small college, Iowa Wesleyan. By the time he left, Mumme had once again recruited him to play quarterback for a team that was similar to Sanders' Colorado experiment: IWU was coming off an 0-10 season and had just two players returning.\n\"We tried to have a team meeting after I got introduced at the press conference and they told me there were going to be 40 guys,\" Mumme said. \"I walk in, there's two, and the three that I brought with me. I just gave 'em the same speech I was going to give 'em anyway about working hard in the offseason, and we're going to win games. One kid just got up and walked out. I guess he decided, 'This is bulls---, I'm not doing this.' So we had four.\"\nLeach was one of only two applicants for Mumme's offensive coordinator job, and they quickly realized they were kindred spirits. It was a leap of faith: The high school coach took a $20,000 pay cut to try to prove himself in college again. The lawyer who could've made $200,000 a year instead was making $12,000, and the golfer took on student-loan debt to go to school in Iowa -- where none of them had ever been.\nThey went 7-4 the next year, then, by 1991, started tinkering and added the up-tempo element where they never huddled and ran plays at a frenetic pace. Opposing teams had never seen anything like it and had no idea how to stop it. In Dewald's accidental career, he threw for 12,045 yards, 115 TDs and set 25 NAIA records. He threw for 4,418 yards and 45 TDs in 1991, including one game where he set national records with 86 attempts and 61 completions. Leach sent out press releases to national media, coining the name \"Air Raid\" in the process and building the mystique.\nWhile it may have appeared the gaudy numbers were because of an intricate playbook, it was actually the opposite. There was no playbook at all. The philosophy was making things as barebones as possible.\nDon't practice plays you won't call in a game. Don't call plays in a game you don't practice. Don't throw to a covered receiver and don't pass up an open one.\nThe plays came from LaVell Edwards at BYU, with Mumme saying he's watched every offensive snap of Edwards' career. He picked his favorites -- four passing and two rushing -- that seemed to always work. His practice drills, the real backbone of the Air Raid, according to the coaches, were all about details of that limited set, and were all based on Bill Walsh's 49ers practices.\nSo he made every practice consistent and repetitive and drilled until they were mind-numbingly boring. Do it until you can't screw it up, and let muscle memory win. And if it works, keep doing it. Mumme said he once called the same play 52 times in a game for Dewald.\nDecades after helping launch the revolution, Dewald has watched teammates like Bill Bedenbaugh, an Iowa Wesleyan offensive linemen who's now considered one of the best O-line coaches in the country at Oklahoma, along with Holgorsen, his old IWU wide receiver who's become another of the sport's most idiosyncratic coaches, and he finds it amusing that he still understands almost everything they do.\n\"For years, I would go visit [Leach or Mumme] every year for at least one home game and spend days with them at practice and on the sidelines of games,\" Dewald said. \"The last time I visited Mike at Washington State, I looked at the script for the game and it was crazy. I actually knew what to do on 90 percent of it -- and it was almost 30 years after I stopped playing. Just to see what they've all accomplished has been mind-blowing for me, how much it's changed the game and how successful they've all been has been, really, cool to watch.\"\nChris Hatcher is convinced Mumme isn't the inventor of the Air Raid. He claims the title.\nHatcher signed at Valdosta State to play for Mike Cavan, a former Georgia assistant who had coached under Vince Dooley and was Herschel Walker's lead recruiter. They were an I-formation team with a few passing concepts.\nMumme arrived at Valdosta after Cavan left for another job and, armed with talent he'd never had before, he initially made the same mistake he criticized other coaches for: He overcomplicated things.\n\"I don't care what anybody says, I'm the guy that invented the Air Raid,\" Hatcher said. \"I was not smart enough to comprehend all this stuff Hal wanted to do. So we had to dummy it way down for me. And then that's when the Air Raid took off. That is the truth.\"\nHatcher learned to appreciate the beauty of perfecting and running an offense so simple that he had a little extra time on his hands, enough to visit a frat party the night before homecoming and leave with a parting gift.\n\"You didn't have to be in the film room all night because it didn't matter what the defense was doing,\" Hatcher said. \"We were so good at it that you had time to go out and steal a cannon in the evening. It was a legit Civil War cannon, now, too. Let's not act like it was a little peashooter.\"\nHatcher threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns and set 29 school records. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals, and when it was all said and done set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. He won the 1994 Harlon Hill Award, often called the D-II Heisman, as the Blazers went 40-17-1 in his career.\nThis captured the attention of Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton, who wanted to match the basketball program pace. He handpicked Mumme, which raised eyebrows among purists who believed such a gimmick offense wouldn't work in the big, bad SEC. But Kentucky already had a homegrown star quarterback in Tim Couch, albeit one who was last seen losing 65-0 in his first start to Florida -- and defensive coordinator Bob Stoops -- and attempted just 84 passes over seven games.\nFirst, Mumme enlisted Hatcher, now a graduate assistant, to convince Couch not to transfer. (They went to Hooters and talked it out.) He stuck around, working with Hatcher, who was in charge of getting Mumme's play scripts prepared for Couch's wristband. Mumme would say Play 1 or Play 2, and Couch would call what's on the wristband. Quarterbacks often would check into different plays freely, but in one game, Couch took it to an extreme.\n\"We get about three or four first downs and Couch ain't run a play Mumme's called yet,\" Hatcher said. \"We go down and score, and the whole time Mumme is on the headsets using a few choice words to me.\"\nMumme accused Hatcher, who often changed the play himself when playing for Mumme, of purposely telling Couch not to run Mumme's calls.\n\"I can't believe you'd do this to me,\" Mumme said, according to Hatcher. \"Then it finally hit me. Couch was using the wristband from the week before, and didn't change it out. Every play was wrong, and we went down and scored anyway. My point is, when you rep the plays so much, we feel like it doesn't matter. I can pick me a handful of plays that should work against just about anything you'll see. I like to say we're a well-coached backyard football team.\"\nCouch's mastery paid off in 1997 when he threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Craig Yeast in overtime to lead Kentucky to a win over Alabama 40-34. It was Kentucky's first win over Alabama in 75 years -- something the Wildcats haven't done since. It came just a year after Couch threw for 13 yards (UK had 67 total yards) in an entire game against Stoops' Florida defense under Steve Spurrier. Couch threw for 348 and 406 yards in the next two meetings. While the Gators ended up pulling away and winning both games handily, it was frustrating for Stoops, and their mentality impressed him.\n\"I liked how [Leach] and Hal Mumme were over there standing together,\" Stoops said. \"I took note of the casual nature of the two of them. But they were the most difficult to deal with.\"\nNothing Mumme did was by accident. He doesn't dispute any contentions that he and Leach were arrogant.\n\"There's no question,\" Mumme said. \"We always thought we were smarter than everybody else. We always thought we had better ideas than everybody else. And we pretty much did. That's why everybody's trying to do it now.\"\nMumme could be combative with reporters, and Leach could be aloof. And they weren't worried about too many other opinions.\n\"We played Jimmy Buffett during warmups,\" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown, who played wide receiver at Kentucky under Mumme. \"I don't know if that gets it going for you.\"\n\"It got me and Mike going,\" Mumme said, laughing. \"We weren't worried about anybody else.\"\nThey loved causing a stir or annoying other fans, like when Leach mocked Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets as head coach at rival Texas Tech.\n\"How come they get to pretend they are soldiers?\" Leach said. \"The thing is, they aren't actually in the military. I ought to have Mike's Pirate School. The freshmen, all they get is the bandanna. When you're a senior, you get the sword and skull and crossbones. For homework, we'll work pirate maneuvers and stuff like that.\"\nThe Aggies were not amused.\nThen again, Leach and Mumme were, which was the point. Jeff Allen can testify.\nBefore Allen became the only staff member that's been with Nick Saban for his entire Alabama tenure, a trusted confidante and sports medicine guru, he was an assistant trainer at Kentucky -- but most importantly, he was Mumme's hot dog guy.\nUK was about to play at LSU in Death Valley, then coached by embattled coach Gerry DiNardo. Mumme marched into the training room on Wednesday with a request that befuddled Allen.\n\"Hey, during pregame, when I'm talking to DiNardo, I want you to bring me a hot dog,\" Mumme said.\nAllen didn't understand. He'd been with him for more than five years at this point, and this was a new one.\n\"Finally, over the next day or two, I said, 'Why do you want a hot dog while you're on the field talking to their head coach?\" Allen said, \"He said, 'Because they're going to be so uptight to begin with. I want to show 'em how carefree and how relaxed I am, and it's going to make them even more nervous.'\"\nMumme was very specific that he wanted mustard on it. He sent a student for the hot dog and was on the field during pregame when he saw Mumme, who he hadn't talked to yet on the day of the game. He thought, \"well here goes nothing,\" and headed over.\n\"I looked at him and said, 'Coach, here's your hot dog,' Allen said. \"He looked at me and goes, 'Oh, thanks Jeff.' Then he said, 'Hey, hold on, hold on. Does it have mustard on it?'\" Allen assured him it did, all the while playing it straight.\n\"I can still see DiNardo's face,\" Allen said. \"He was like, 'What in the world is happening here?' And I swear to you, Hal just stood there talking and eating that hot dog. I walked off and I turned around and I wanted to see it again. And there they are talking and Hal is just chomping on a hotdog right there on the 50-yard line of Tiger Stadium. And our players were seeing it. They were laughing. They were dying during warmups watching it.\"\nThe Wildcats were 0-24 on the road against ranked teams since 1977. They were 9½-point underdogs. They played fast and loose and kicked a walk-off field goal to win at the buzzer 39-36, sealing one of the biggest wins in school history. It led Kentucky to a bid in the Outback Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl for the Wildcats since 1952.\n\"I'm not saying we won that game because of the hot dog,\" Allen said. \"But I don't think it hurt.\"\nOn Dec. 1, 1998, Oklahoma hired Stoops. The Sooners hadn't had a winning season in six years and were coming off a 12-22 stretch in three years under John Blake. Stoops, then 38, was a hot commodity as a defensive coordinator. Hiring someone to run his offense was his first big decision.\n\"My initial talks were with Turner Gill, who was at Nebraska at the time,\" Stoops said. \"That didn't really work out. And then I got to thinking. ... I didn't know [Leach], but the more I thought about it, the more I referred back to how challenging it was to handle Kentucky. If they can be that good at Kentucky, why couldn't we be as good or better at Oklahoma? So I went with it.\"\nIt was a bold move. Leach had never been a playcaller, and let's face it, he was pretty weird.\n\"I thought Mike was really interesting,\" Stoops said. \"Mike had a little different way of doing things. But let me tell you something: He was a hell of a leader. He was demanding, as aloof as he might be. He wanted things done a certain way and they damn sure better be done that way or you were going to hear it. He might look laid back, he was demanding, very demanding.\"\nThat was a learning curve for the rest of the staff, who couldn't figure out if this was all an act, or if Leach was for real.\n\"It was completely different from anything that any of us had seen in the offensive meeting room,\" former Oklahoma assistant and Kansas head coach Mark Mangino said. \"It did take time to get used to.\"\nSo did Leach's personality. The staff was all staying at a hotel in Norman, and somehow Mangino's room became the center of the action.\n\"I couldn't get him out of my room when I was living in the Residence Inn,\" Mangino said. \"Every night, somebody delivered a couple cases of beer, a box of cigars, and we sat around and called recruits till about 11:30.\"\nBy midnight, everyone was gone. Except Leach.\n\"Mike used to like to watch those simulcasts of Howard Stern. And those things would run till 4 in the morning. I'm in my bed trying to sleep. And here's Leach at 3 in the morning, he's laughing at Howard Stern, he's drinking a beer and he's having a good time.\"\nStoops, too, had a learning curve.\n\"I learned after the first few weeks late at night not to stop in and check in on Mike,\" Stoops said. \"One night, it's 11 or something, I'm ready to go home, and he starts telling me a story about Geronimo. After about 20 minutes, I said, 'Mike, I'm going home. I'm the head coach, I get to go when I want.'\"\nMangino, meanwhile, couldn't shake him at night, and he couldn't get through to him by day. In a staff meeting, Mangino suggested a running play. Leach couldn't have been less interested. Mangino suggested trying it at practice, and Leach blew him off again. Mangino said maybe he'll practice it anyway.\n\"Mike said, you could put it in all you want, you could run it during every play of inside drill, but I'm never going to call it in a game,\" and Mangino and Leach nearly came to blows, Stoops said, laughing.\nAn irritated Stoops called them into his office and made them hash it out. Stoops made it clear that he had given Leach full control, and they'd do it his way. Leach and Mangino became good friends.\nThe Big 12 was never the same. The new-look Sooners went 7-5 and made their first bowl game in five years. Texas Tech hired Leach, and Mangino took over, finally getting to put in a couple of wrinkles of his own.\nMangino had a season's worth of reps in place, and he said he ran about 80% of Leach's offense. \"And it worked,\" he said. The Sooners won a national championship, going 13-0 behind Josh Heupel, a lightly recruited junior college quarterback Leach found at Snow College.\nFrom the @kfor archives, Mike Leach at his last OU practice with Josh Heupel on Dec. 8, 1999. You can see the emotions as he talks with Heupel. Leach was introduced as the Texas Tech head coach the next day. pic.twitter.com/xm65rAhAes\n\"They were the ones that invented it ... but we [Oklahoma, Leach, Texas Tech and the Big 12] were the ones to make it popular,\" Stoops said. \"They weren't getting the national attention at Kentucky until we started it. And then, of course, we kept it and won the national championship.\"\nLeach became a star at Texas Tech. He took down No. 1 Texas, guided the Red Raiders to a bowl game in all 10 of his seasons and finished as the program's all-time winningest coach at 84-43.\nDykes was part of Leach's first staff that replaced his dad, Spike Dykes, who had retired.\n\"We were doing all this stuff that was really analytics, but they didn't know it was,\" Dykes said. \"We were going for it all the time on fourth down or going for it in our own territory. My dad would be like, 'What the hell are you doing?' I'm like, 'It gives us a chance to beat Texas. Instead of losing by 14, we might lose by 50. But we also might win?'\"\nIt became one of the most influential eras in college football. In Mumme's days in Kentucky, Urban Meyer and Sean Payton were among the earliest coaches to visit to try to learn what the Air Raid is all about. In Lubbock, Leach made sure his doors were wide open, and there were visitors everywhere.\nLeach made sure his coaches knew that he wanted them to teach visitors anything they wanted to know.\nThere was only one issue: \"They didn't believe us,\" said Lincoln Riley, who was a student assistant for Leach, because the entire offense was so simple.\n\"I've never been to a place where you had more coaches around constantly,\" Riley said. \"Mike was so open to people coming in. You think just Texas high school coaches? No. I'm talking professional coaches, college coaches from all around the country, high school coaches from all around the country, every single year. There's a group from Japan that came, groups from England that came over, I mean, you name it, we had 'em.\"\nDykes and Holgorsen, who were receivers coaches and later co-offensive coordinators, would handle a lot of high school coaches on their visits. Dykes said he can remember walking out to the parking lot one day and overhearing the coaches leaving convinced the offense couldn't be that simple, that Leach & Co. were holding things back.\n\"'Those sumb------ wouldn't tell us anything,'\" Dykes recalled them saying. \"And we told them everything.\"\nMuleshoe High's David Wood coached Riley and his brother Garrett Riley, now the offensive coordinator at Clemson, and watched as they passed over small-school offers to head to Lubbock to learn from Leach. Over time, he said, you could see the Tech influence take hold and spread throughout high school football, with Muleshoe being one of the early adopters, because Lincoln returned to help him install it while he was still a walk-on quarterback at Tech.\n\"We were a run offense, but once we realized how simple it was, we didn't think it was going to be that hard to switch,\" Wood said. \"We used to run maybe 30 plays in practice because you analyze every play and tell every player what they did wrong and then you'd run the play again and make sure everyone did it right. The way Leach did it, when we watched it, you got to coach on the run. So we were able to get like 120 plays a practice instead of 30 plays a practice.\"\nWood said when Riley set out for Lubbock in 2002, there were maybe two schools in the Texas Panhandle that were running a spread offense.\n\"I would say probably 70 percent of the teams we played when I retired [in 2017] were running it,\" he said. \"Maybe 80.\"\nThe Big 12 became known for its shootouts, and Leach's earliest quarterback rooms were filled with future stars and coaches, all of whom waited their turn, many of them just to start for one season. Kliff Kingsbury, who had originally signed with Spike Dykes, threw for more than 5,000 yards as a senior in 2002 and set seven NCAA records in his three years as a starter at Tech. His backup, B.J. Symons, set the NCAA passing record with 5,833 yards in 2003, and Symons' backups, Sonny Cumbie and Cody Hodges, each passed for more than 4,000 yards in a season as starters.\nThey did it all because Leach repeated the same things he and Mumme had always preached, particularly in the film room.\n\"The worst coaching point he would ever give us, and the one that we all hated, was: 'This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy wasn't open. And he's the one guy you threw it to!\" said Cumbie, now the head coach at Louisiana Tech, imitating Leach's monotone cadence. \"I don't care if it's two-high [safety coverage], one-high. Is it man? Is it zone? Is this guy open? Yes. Throw it to him.\"\nMumme's Kentucky era ended in an NCAA investigation, with Mumme resigning in 2001 amid findings that an assistant coach was sending money orders to players in Memphis. Mumme was cited for a \"failure to monitor,\" but was not punished by the NCAA.\nSince then, he'll sign up to coach anything, anytime, anywhere, including stops at New Mexico State, reviving football after 20 years at Southeastern Louisiana or stops at Division III schools Belhaven in Mississippi and McMurry in Texas.\n\"I'm the Johnny Appleseed of football,\" Mumme said. \"I always thought that was a great story. It's not that I set out to do that -- I never set out to get kicked out of Kentucky -- but when you look back on it, providence had a plan. We spread it a whole lot of places it wouldn't have been otherwise.\"\nAnd despite his offense being almost the norm now, rather than catching teams by surprise, it still works as it was intended: As a sort of money ball, beating teams that you have no business beating.\nAt McMurry, he took over a program that had three winless seasons in the previous decade, including an 0-10 mark the year before he arrived. Three years later, they were 9-3 and 7-1 in the conference.\nOut of the spotlight, Mumme still made history. And he did it in the most Mumme way possible.\nMcMurry opened the 2011 season with an 82-6 loss to Stephen F. Austin, who was ranked in the FCS at the time. After getting down early, Mumme would just keep going for it on fourth down over and over. He was down 35-0 at halftime, and it only got worse from there. But he wouldn't stop.\n\"Losing by 50 was the same as losing by 1,\" Dykes said. \"Hal never cared.\"\nThe next week, Mumme gave the team four days off. He showed them five plays from the first half where it easily could've been 35-28 instead of 35-0. They were set to face UTSA the next week, a D-I team coached by Larry Coker, who'd won a national championship at Miami. Mumme's quarterback, Jake Mullin, like Dewald, wasn't on the team when he arrived. He played baseball, but was a quarterback on the intramural team when Mumme found him.\n\"They said they created this offense for teams without much talent, which was great for us,\" Mullin said, who, like Dewald, ended up throwing for more than 12,000 yards in his career. \"Whenever [Mumme] got there, there was not much there. I mean, I remember I was bigger than my left guard.\"\nMumme took the team to the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, his favorite place, where Teddy Roosevelt recruited Texans at the bar to serve in his Rough Riders. He took the team on a tour of the Alamo the night before the game. The next day, McMurry upset UTSA 24-21 in front of 31,000 fans in the Alamodome, one of the only upsets of a D-I team by a D-III team in history, and Mullin threw for 372 yards.\n\"The Menger's filled with ghosts, we did have a ghost sighting in there,\" Mumme said. \"Between the Menger ghosts and the Alamo ghosts, they probably helped us out.\"\nMumme's fascination with history earned him an invitation from then-McMurry professor Don Frazier to a party for his new book, \"The Alamo and Beyond.\" Also invited? One of the world's largest collectors of Alamo memorabilia in the world: Phil Collins. Yes, that Phil Collins.\nFrazier didn't want Collins to be constantly accosted at the event, so he invited Mumme because he said half the table of Texans would rather talk to Mumme about the Air Raid and Leach than to a British rock star. Even about the Alamo.\nMumme got his copy autographed by Collins. The inscription reads:\n\"To coach... Something's in the air tonight. Cheers. Phil Collins.\"\nMumme, 71, keeps spreading the gospel. He is part of the operations group of a new spring league called the International Football Alliance with teams in Mexico and Texas, and will coach one of the teams. His son, Matt, who never became Michael Jordan, instead stuck with the family business and is now the assistant head coach at Colorado State.\nMumme has seen his little creation change the sport, including watching some of the most storied running teams of his lifetime at USC and Oklahoma be completely transformed. Now, it's finally broken through to the final frontier: the Big Ten, where Wisconsin, under Leach acolyte Phil Longo, is following the same formula as Oklahoma: Join forces with a defensive head coach (Luke Fickell) and flip the offense. Harrell, the former Leach quarterback, is the new offensive coordinator at Purdue as well.\n\"A couple of days before Mike passed, we talked and he was just ultra excited that we're bringing the Air Raid to the Big Ten,\" Longo said. \"It's the most excited I've ever heard him. So it meant something to me that he was happy that we were making moves, and he's the only one who didn't seem shocked by it.\"\nMason Miller, Leach's offensive line coach at Mississippi State who is now the offensive coordinator at Tarleton State, has worked for either Mumme or Leach basically since 1994 when he played running back at Valdosta State. He said the Air Raid family has become so big that it has its share of \"little sibling rivalries,\" but that when they all get together, \"we're like magnets to each other.\"\nLeach's loss has been profound on the family. But out of that loss, there's a new beginning.\nLeach's son Cody spent two years as a volunteer coach at BYU under Kalani Sitake, and spent his dad's final year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State. Now, he's an assistant special teams coach for the Bulldogs, who has completed his Air Raid certification -- a service Mumme offers to keep spreading the word to coaches anywhere -- and is studying his dad's old game tapes stored in Gatorade coolers in his garage.\n\"I wish I could have gotten more time with him,\" Cody, 27, said. \"But Dad being so famous, being on TV, the occasional 'Friday Night Lights' cameo and other random stuff in media, I can always find him. Not everyone has that kind of opportunity where your parent is so well-documented that you can just find them and pull them up anytime.\"\nThere's another Mumme-Leach pairing in the works, with Cody hoping to follow his father's path.\n\"He knew so many other amazing coaches and all the guys he knows, I've known for a long time too,\" Cody said. \"So I have plenty of people to be able to talk to. His was the first generation, and it's kind of taking off into other branches. For me, it's a legacy.\"\nStoops says he can't help but look around and see how profound their impact was.\n\"It goes back to Mike,\" he said. \"And Hal's not talked enough about. He and Mike were joined at the hip. Between the two of them, I don't know that anyone's had a stronger influence on coaches. It goes on and on. The influence is huge. These tentacles from them go all over the place. They branch out from the two of them everywhere.\"\nJake Trotter and Chris Low contributed to this story."}
{"title": "Man City didn't view Arsenal as a threat, but now they do", "date": "2023-10-05 12:29:45", "text": "Craig Burley says losing Bukayo Saka to injury is an especially big blow for Arsenal ahead of their Premier League fixture against Man City. (2:18)\nWhen Arsenal approached Manchester City over the availability of full-back João Cancelo earlier this summer, the short-shrift response signalled a marked change in attitude from a year earlier.\nCity had then allowed striker Gabriel Jesus and left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko to join the Gunners for fees totalling around £90 million, deals which at the time seemed to reflect both Mikel Arteta's growing reputation as a coach and the amiable nature of his friendship with his former boss at City, Pep Guardiola.\nThe arrivals of Jesus and Zinchenko helped clarify Arteta's vision for the Gunners more than anyone imagined -- the team that finished 24 points behind City in 2021-22 suddenly emerged as their main rivals, ending the season in second place having spent a total of 248 days at the top of the table.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nSo much so, in fact, that as Arsenal tried their luck in negotiations for another player to have fallen out of favour in Cancelo, City's approach had completely altered.\n\"City's view of us is completely different this year than last,\" one senior executive at Arsenal told ESPN.\nCancelo's relationship with Guardiola had deteriorated and a permanent transfer fee in excess of £50m was suggested. The Gunners would not necessarily have been deterred by that valuation, but City had no intention of strengthening Arteta's side once again.\nWith Jesus and Zinchenko, City acquiesced to Arsenal on the basis of receiving healthy transfer fees for two players about the enter the final year of their respective contracts. This time, City ended up agreeing on a simple loan with Barcelona for Cancelo in a move that contained no option or obligation to sign permanently and a modest loan fee. Whatever the financial hit, City's view was that Cancelo should not join Arsenal. They had benefitted enough previously.\nFor the Gunners, the versatile Jurriën Timber represented a much more viable option and they moved to sign him for £38m from Ajax. Arsenal were also interested in City midfielder Ilkay Gündogan but he chose to join Barcelona at the end of his contract, a move he later described as a \"childhood dream\" and one which ensured City avoided any further embarrassment.\nThere was a time when City regularly signed players from Arsenal: five players -- Kolo Toure, Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri -- made the journey north between 2009 and 2014 as City's Abu Dhabi takeover gave them a wealth the Gunners could not compete with.\nThe recent reversal was down, in part, to City simply not viewing Arsenal as a direct threat; the same could arguably be true of Chelsea now given they allowed Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer to join the Blues in the last 16 months.\nCity's stance on Cancelo is symptomatic of the respect Arsenal gained through last season's title challenge. Sources have told ESPN that it didn't take Guardiola long to realise how much the players had helped Arteta's rebuild. It is said Arsenal's 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea in Orlando last July was the moment he first thought the club were on their way to becoming a serious proposition.\nChelsea were in disarray at the time -- and would sack head coach Thomas Tuchel a month or so later -- but the Gunners exhibited a fluidity and determination that would propel them up the table in the subsequent campaign.\nThey fell short of a first Premier League title since 2004, somewhat running out of steam as a combination of fatigue, inexperience and William Saliba's injury undermined performances in the final few weeks. But City knew they were in a proper fight, run close by a team that, while not yet good enough to be considered an equal, is certainly reducing the gap at significant speed.\nSunday's meeting between the two sides offers a measure of that progress and a chance for Arsenal to address another key factor in separating these sides: the head-to-head record.\nDespite the pressure City were under in pursuing a treble, they gave Arsenal something of a schooling in both Premier League matches last season in addition to knocking Arteta's side out of the FA Cup at the third-round stage.\nThe first league meeting was originally pushed back from October to February as a result of fixture complications related to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. City outclassed Arsenal in a 3-1 win at Emirates Stadium and beat them 4-1 in April as Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland ripped the Gunners to shreds.\nAugust's Community Shield victory over City on penalties was hailed by goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale as \"a marker to know we can go and beat Man City in a big game when it matters\" but a Premier League win this weekend can have a truly transformative effect.\nArsenal have lost their last 12 league meetings with City; they have not taken three points off them since January 2015.\nIf City view Arsenal differently, the opposite could also be true. Perhaps, finally, Arsenal believe they are beatable. City unexpectedly lost 2-1 to Wolves last weekend and the suspension of midfielder Rodri -- who played more league minutes than any other City player last season -- after his red card, alongside the absense of injured playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, makes them a less formidable proposition.\nMidfield is an area where Declan Rice will look to take centre stage, having been the subject of offers from both Arsenal and City prior to leaving West Ham for an initial £100m this summer.\nCity felt Arsenal could still be bullied in a physical challenge, particularly in April's game when they went more direct to Haaland to use his power. Rice offers more robustness, but he will also need to exhibit bravery in his passing to help Arsenal impose themselves.\nHad City signed Rice, he would almost certainly have lined up against Arsenal this weekend with Rodri suspended but, as it is, he will seek to reinvigorate Arteta's side as they aim to shake off a Champions League midweek defeat to Lens.\nBukayo Saka's fitness will make a significant difference -- the club are waiting on scan results to determine the extent of a muscular problem -- but whether the 22-year-old forward is available or not, one thing is for sure: City won't underestimate Arsenal any longer."}

(1:41)\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he wants his side's Premier League game against Tottenham Hotspur to be replayed after a Luis Díaz goal was incorrectly ruled out for offside in one of the worst errors in the history of VAR.\nThe score was 0-0 in the 34th minute when the incident happened, and Liverpool went on to lose 2-1 to an injury-time Joël Matip own goal.\n- The VAR Review: What went wrong for Luis Díaz's offside goal\n- VAR's wildest moments: Diaz offside, Alisson's two red cards\nBut does Klopp have any grounds for the match to be replayed? And is it even possible? We look at what's happened.\nProfessional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the governing body for referees, has admitted \"standards fell short of expectations\" for the Díaz goal.\nThe VAR during the game, Darren England, incorrectly thought the on-field decision was \"goal.\" While he quickly identified that Díaz was onside, he told the referee \"check complete\" -- which mistakenly indicated to the on-field team that the offside flag was correct.\nThe game restarted with the score still 0-0.\nPGMOL subsequently released the full audio of the VAR conversation.\nOn Wednesday, he told a news conference: \"Not as a manager of Liverpool so much, more as a football person, I think the only outcome should be a replay. Probably will not happen. The argument against that will probably be that if we open that gate then everyone will ask for it.\n\"I think the situation is that unprecedented that ... something like that, as far as I can remember, never happened. That's why a replay would be the right thing.\"\nNo yet, as Klopp says the club are still \"going through the information we have.\"\nOn Sunday night, Liverpool issued a strongly worded statement which said the error \"undermined sporting integrity.\"\nYes. As you can imagine, the possibility of having to replay a match, for whatever reason, has to be covered within the Premier League rule book.\nRule L.18. states: \"The Board shall have power to order that a League Match be replayed provided that a recommendation to that effect has been made by a Commission in exercise of its powers under Rule W.51.\"\nBut that doesn't automatically mean the rule applies in a case like this.\nLiverpool would have to lodge a complaint with the Premier League. A commission would then be set up (as per Rule W.51) to assess the merits of the case and reach a decision.\nWithin the remit of the commission is to \"recommend that the Board orders that a League Match or such other match ... be replayed.\"\nNot in English league football. Cup games have been replayed due to a number of factors, including a team making too many substitutes or fielding an ineligible player.\nFamously in 1999, an FA Cup game between Arsenal and Sheffield United was replayed after the Gunners scored from a throw-in after the opposition had knocked the ball out for an Arsenal player to receive treatment. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger later made the offer to replay the match.\nThat might help things along, but the Premier League would still need to agree amid the danger of a precedent being set.\nThis is where it starts to fall down.\nVAR protocol, which is part of the Laws of the Game, states: \"In principle, a match is not invalidated because of: wrong decision(s) involving the VAR (as the VAR is a match official).\"\nThis is where we need to revisit Liverpool's statement, where they very specifically said: \"It is clear that the correct application of the laws of the game did not occur.\"\nWhile a wrong decision might not be grounds for a game to be played again, failing to apply the Laws of the Game correctly can be seen as a valid reason.\nHowever, this is usually a more technical reason, such as a team being allowed to score a goal through an incorrect application of encroachment on a missed penalty.\nJulien Laurens thinks Luis Díaz's disallowed goal in Tottenham vs. Liverpool is the biggest VAR mistake in the Premier League so far this season.\nIt is likely they will say the \"wrong\" decision was not made by the match officials. The VAR knew Diaz was onside, and was supposed to be telling the referee the forward was onside. Therefore, this is a mistake in applying the decision rather than simply getting it wrong.\nThe closest is probably the goal France had disallowed against Tunisia at the World Cup last year.\nAntoine Griezmann thought he had equalised deep into stoppage time, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside. However, the referee had restarted the game, and then blown for full-time before the review happened -- which broke VAR protocol. It should not have been possible to disallow the goal.\nFrance protested and wanted the goal to be reinstated, but the appeal was dismissed by FIFA's disciplinary committee and the result stood.\nWhy didn't Arsenal get a replay when the VAR failed to disallow Brentford's goal for offside last season? The VAR didn't notice there was a player offside, so it was an error.\nWhat about the goal Sheffield United were not awarded in the 0-0 draw with Aston Villa when goal-line technology failed? The VAR didn't check for a tech failure, so they didn't know it happened.\nAnd how about Brighton's disallowed goal at Crystal Palace when the VAR drew the lines on the wrong player? The VAR decision was offside and communicated as offside.\nFor Liverpool, the VAR decision was onside and communicated as offside, and that's the difference they will point to.\nIt's highly unlikely. Even though it was a unique circumstance, it would set a dangerous precedent.\nIf they did, could Wolves then ask to replay their game at Manchester United after they were wrongly denied an injury-time penalty through a bad VAR decision?\nIf Liverpool do make an official request it is unlikely to go down well with other clubs, who have all suffered their own injustices, none more so than Brighton who were subjected to a catalogue of errors last season which may have impacted their chances of making the Champions League this season."}

(1:38)\nThe 2023-24 Champions League group stage is underway, and matchday two is in the books with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Barcelona the only teams to maintain a 100% record. After a thrilling round of games, we asked our writers Gab Marcotti, Rob Dawson and Sam Marsden to answer some of our burning questions.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n- Guardiola passes Sir Alex Ferguson for UCL wins\nManchester United. Two games, two defeats, and they're already struggling to qualify for the Round of 16. They've scored five goals in games against Bayern Munich and Galatasaray but the way they've defended has been appalling, leaking seven goals in 180 minutes of football. They conceded three at home against Galatasaray but it could have been even worse. Mauro Icardi missed a penalty after Casemiro had been sent off, and also had a good chance in stoppage-time with the score already at 3-2. It's not the first time in recent history that United have been in trouble in the group stage, going out before the knockouts in both 2015-16 and 2020-21. -- Dawson\nFive teams are on zero points, but obviously Manchester United stand out, mainly because of the recurring psychodrama in the background (Antony, the Glazers, Jadon Sancho, half the starting back four out, etc.) and their horrible league form as well. I'd throw in Paris Saint-Germain as well, simply because of the manner of the 4-1 defeat at Newcastle United, the way the club can be a zoo, and the fact that head coach Luis Enrique is, well, different. And if I'm Arsenal, I'm not taking things for granted either. Sevilla home and away next can be very tricky. -- Marcotti\nIt's Man United, isn't it?! But to add some variety, there is also pressure on Luis Enrique and PSG. It's not just that they lost to Newcastle, it's that they were beaten 4-1. Throw in the fact they are in the toughest group in the competition and now have a double-header coming up against AC Milan and it's not hard to imagine them failing to make it into the knockout rounds. Three draws and a defeat in seven Ligue 1 games show this is not just a European issue, either. The post-Lionel Messi and Neymar years, built around Kylian Mbappé and French brilliance, were not supposed to be so rocky so soon. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley and Alejandro Moreno assess another dismal defeat for Man United in the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Galatasaray.\nFC Copenhagen. They've never been past the group stage, but they've done enough in the opening two games to show they've got a chance this time. They were 2-0 up against Galatasaray in Istanbul with four minutes to go, and were only pegged back to 2-2 after going down to 10 men; then they took the lead at home against Bayern before narrowly losing 2-1. Their fate in Group A will be decided by back-to-back games against Manchester United, and with Erik ten Hag's team not playing well, the Danish champions could spring a surprise. -- Dawson\nLet's face it, nobody in Group F (Newcastle, PSG, AC Milan and Dortmund), which is wide open, is an underdog. Nor are Lens, frankly. So I'm going to suggest Feyenoord. I love the fact that head coach Arne Slot decided to stick around and give it a go after winning the Eredivisie title, rather than chasing coin elsewhere like so many of his colleagues would have done. They gave Atletico Madrid a real fright away, and can do the same to others. -- Marcotti\nMaybe underdog is pushing it, but Real Sociedad were in pot four in the draw so should technically be the worst the team in their group. I know the science to the pots means that isn't necessarily the case but Internazionale and Benfica would still have been the two teams expected to progress. Instead, La Real sit top after two games thanks to a draw against the Italians and Tuesday's 2-0 win at FC Salzburg. Take Kubo and Brais Méndez are great fun to watch, and they have a homegrown spine that makes it easy to root for them. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley lays into the performance of PSG's Kylian Mbappe following their thumping 4-1 defeat to Newcastle United in the Champions League.\nManchester United have been rubbish in the Champions League but £72 million striker Rasmus Hojlund has, at least, been a positive. The 20-year-old became the youngest player to score in his first two Champions League games since Erling Haaland when he found the net against Galatasaray after opening his United account on matchday one against Bayern. His first against Galatasaray was a thumping header from Marcus Rashford's cross, and his second was about his pace and finishing ability after racing away from the halfway line. Hojlund is under immense pressure to perform as United's central striker and, so far, he's handling it well. -- Dawson\nAm I allowed to say Newcastle defender Dan Burn? What, you want somebody more glamorous? I had zero expectations for Icardi, but he came up huge for Galatasaray last season and it's continuing this year. Some love for Atletico striker Álvaro Morata too, please. Mendez has been really impressive for Real Sociedad, and Man City's Julián Álvarez gets better every time I see him play. -- Marcotti\nIt's hard to focus on one player after just two games, but I'll go with Alvarez. He was the star in Manchester City's win over Red Star Belgrade and then came off the bench to down RB Leipzig on Wednesday. He's making it impossible for City boss Pep Guardiola to leave him out when the big games come around. A shout out for João Félix, too, who has been good in both of Barcelona's games so far, and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham. Even if we expected him to be good, we did not imagine him having this impact so soon, with important goals in wins over Union Berlin and Napoli. -- Marsden\nAle Moreno heaps praise on Jude Bellingham following Real Madrid's Champions League win over Napoli.\nThey need to defend better. Injuries, particularly at the back, have been a problem this season, but Lisandro Martínez, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are likely to miss the rest of the group-stage games and manager Ten Hag has to find a way of improving with the players he's got available. One easy fix is to move Sofyan Amrabat from a makeshift left-back into midfield to give Casemiro some help. Casemiro will have to serve a suspension after his red card against Galatasaray, but having him alongside Amrabat once the Brazilian is back will make United far more robust in the middle of the pitch. -- Dawson\nIt's kinda two different questions as I see it, in the sense they don't need to hit their stride to get out of the group. Obviously, they need to take four of six points in the double-header against Copenhagen and avoid defeat in Istanbul. Then, on matchday six, they play Bayern, who will probably have qualified by then and may play the C-team. So that's eight points they can get without being particularly good. And that might be enough.\nHow do they actually get good? Well, that's a far more complicated question. I'm not sure their injured guys will be back in time to affect this group stage, Casemiro is now suspended, Antony is anyone's guess. There's enough there that Bruno Fernandes and Rashford can carry them at times (not all the time as we've seen) but there's a reason why they've only won three games all season (I'm not counting the win over Palace in the Carabao Cup). And, lest we forget, Wolverhampton Wanderers were robbed after outplaying them for long stretches, and United they had to come from two goals down to beat Nottingham Forest, who played the last 23 minutes with 10 men. Meanwhile, against Burnley, they were thoroughly outplayed and it took a moment of magic from Bruno (and ... wait for it ... Jonny Freaking Evans!) to get the three points. Yeah, it's bad, it's really bad. -- Marcotti\nAs Gab points out, the two are not mutually exclusive. United are now in a situation where they need to turn to an old football cliche and take things game by game. In that sense, they have a nice fixture list. Back-to-back matches against Copenhagen, who have proven tough opponents against Galatasaray and Bayern, give them a chance to revive their European hopes. Winning those fixtures would set up a huge game in Turkey against Galatasaray. Beyond that, they need to get players back in their natural positions (which is not easy with their list of absentees, but Amrabat into midfield would be a start) and build around their best players, who at the moment are Bruno and Hojlund. The latter's goal-scoring ability could help lift the mood around the team, but it looks bleak at the moment. -- Marsden"}
{"title": "Best, worst moments of Xavi's 100 games as Barcelona manager", "date": "2023-10-05 12:38:50", "text": "There have been ups and downs along the way, but it's indisputable that Barcelona are in a better place now than they were when they appointed Xavi Hernandez, as the coach took charge of his 100th game on Wednesday night against Porto in the Champions League.\nXavi, 43, replaced Ronald Koeman in November 2021 just months after Lionel Messi had left Barça, with the club in financial crisis, ninth in LaLiga and on the verge of elimination from the Champions League. Almost two years on, the Catalan side are reigning LaLiga champions, outplayed bitter rivals Real Madrid to win the Spanish Super Cup earlier this year and have hopes of regaining their status among Europe's biggest sides.\nThe path back to the summit has not always been straightforward, especially in the Champions League. Barça have been knocked out in the group stage in back-to-back campaigns and after dropping into the Europa League as a consequence, have also failed to make it past the quarterfinal stage of the continent's secondary competition.\nOverall, though, the highs outweigh the lows. There have been two trophies -- including a first LaLiga title since 2019 -- 63 victories from 100 games and a squad overhaul that's seen the focus switch back to La Masia, the club's famous academy. Gavi (19), Lamine Yamal (16), Alejandro Balde (19), Pedri (20) and Fermín López (20) are five players aged 20 or under getting regular minutes under Xavi, who has also added premium, top-flight experience in the form of Robert Lewandowski and Ilkay Gündogan.\nIncredibly, just three players remain from the starting XI in Xavi's first game, a 1-0 win over Espanyol on Nov. 20, 2021: goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen, plus midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Gavi. Meanwhile Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba are among the heavyweights who have left as Xavi managed to separate his friendships with his former teammates from the storied club's sporting issues.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nThe 21-man squad for the current season -- the 19 players registered for the first team plus youngsters Lamine and Fermín -- features 11 Xavi signings, plus various players who were in the B team or youth teams at the time when he took over. It's a combination which Xavi, who recently signed a new contract until 2025, feels is fuelling Barça's push for trophies.\n\"What I would highlight is the mix we have achieved between veterans and youngsters and the human quality of the players in the squad,\" he told ESPN as he looked ahead to his 100th game in charge. \"It is not easy to create the atmosphere we have in the dressing room at the moment.\"\n(With reporting by Jordi Blanco)\nThe games Xavi remembers most fondly are the ones that yielded trophies. The first came via a 3-1 win over Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup final in January this year.\n\"That was the best game, absolutely no doubt,\" Xavi said. \"I have said it several times and I stand by it. I go for that game because of the performance, because you saw how we wanted to play and because it was our first trophy. Also, because of who it was against. After that day, the players believed in everything we wanted to do.\"\nThe LaLiga title followed a few months later. After Franck Kessié's dramatic late winner in the Clásico against Madrid, Barça sealed top spot with a 4-2 win away against Espanyol, prompting angry home supporters to chase the Blaugrana players off the pitch as they celebrated a first domestic championship in four years.\n\"Winning the league will always be unforgettable,\" Xavi added. \"We finally did it. It had been our main objective since we took on the job. We showed that we could do it -- and against our city rival as well. We produced one of our best performances of the season.\"\nSam Marsden explains why Joao Felix has made an instant impact at Barca, after struggling at Atletico Madrid and Chelsea.\nWhile there were no trophies in 2021-22, there were memorable moments as Barça climbed the table to secure Champions League qualification -- something that was far from guaranteed when Xavi took the job. The midseason signings of Ferran Torres, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Dani Alves and Adama Traoré sparked a revival and produced some scintillating performances between January and March. The 4-2 wins against Atletico Madrid and Napoli stand out, while that run of form going into the international break culminated with a 4-0 over Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in LaLiga.\nThat win prompted Pique to post on social media: \"We're back.\" Pique's comment proved premature as Barça suffered a dip in form after the international break, but those results laid the foundations for a title charge the following campaign -- albeit after a summer in which Lewandowski, Raphinha, Jules Koundé, Andreas Christensen and Kessié arrived after club assets were sold off to fund a splurge on the transfer market.\nThe Super Cup win over Madrid, in which Xavi fielded four midfielders plus Lewandowski and Ousmane Dembélé in attack, provided the squad with the self-belief to go on and win LaLiga, but it was two performances this season that Xavi described as \"the best Barça have played\" during his tenure.\nThe beautiful game lives here.

The way Barça played, with Cancelo stepping into midfield, Felix linking with Lewandowski and quick, one-touch positional play across the pitch \"is the path to follow,\" Xavi said.\nDespite success domestically and impressive wins over 14-time European champions Madrid, Barça have still struggled in Europe. Capitulations in recent years against Roma, Liverpool and Bayern Munich have left their mark, and it is in the Champions League where Xavi's side have suffered their bleakest nights.\nA goalless draw at Camp Nou against Benfica in Xavi's first Champions League game in charge left them with a mountain to climb going to Munich in 2021. Needing a win to get through to the knockout rounds, they capitulated, losing 3-0. Xavi labelled that defeat \"rock bottom\" but it was elimination a year later, when he had been given time to put his mark on the side, that stung more.\n\"The 3-0 loss at home to Bayern last season,\" Xavi told ESPN when asked for the worst game of the 99 he has overseen. \"It was a tough defeat, the worst because it was the night we were knocked out. We either weren't able to or didn't know how to compete in the necessary way.\n\"Bayern have been my toughest opponent. It's always difficult to play against them. And, of course, Madrid. They are always a hard side to face whatever the circumstances because of who they are and because of everything that surrounds a Clásico.\"\nThat Bayern defeat had already been preceded by some disappointing European nights: a 2-0 loss in Munich, a 1-0 defeat to Inter Milan and a 3-3 draw at home to the Italians, which was actually the result which effectively ended Barça's Champions League campaign that season. A Europa League exit followed at the hands of Manchester United, although elimination in the same competition to Eintracht Frankfurt -- when the German team's supporters took over Camp Nou, snapping up over 20,000 tickets in the home end and prompting an internal club investigation -- was arguably more painful.\n\"The problem was we were considered favourites going into it,\" Xavi said of Barça's Europa League struggles. \"I don't think we fully believed that we were playing in that competition. It is hard to compete in a tournament that a lot of Barca fans and people, in general, don't care much about.\"\nThe 4-0 Copa del Rey semifinal reverse to Madrid in April at Camp Nou, after winning the first leg 1-0, was minimised due to the number of players missing for the game and the fact that the LaLiga title was imminent, but it was a result that sewed just a few doubts about whether Barça really were back.\nThere is no letup at Barça and winning one title does not buy you another 100 games in charge. Xavi, who made 767 appearances for the club -- a number only bettered by Lionel Messi -- knows that.\n\"For those that know the club, it's about excellence in everything we do,\" he said in a news conference earlier this year. \"That's why this is the most difficult club in the world. There is no comparison. There is no other club in the world like this, [with that] demand to win playing well. It is very difficult.\n\"We are obliged to win and play well. This is Barça. A 1-0 in the 90th minute is not enough, we know this.\"\nThat lays out what is expected from Xavi over the next two years. Barça must continue to improve aesthetically. They have to be in the running to win LaLiga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup. It is in Europe, though, where Xavi faces his biggest challenge. There will be no excuses if they fail to get out of a Champions League group this season that includes Porto, Royal Antwerp and Shakhtar Donetsk.\nFrom there, there is an element of luck of the draw, but Barça need to show they can at least compete with -- not necessarily beat -- Europe's biggest teams again, as they seek a first Champions League trophy since 2015, back when Xavi was still part of the team's midfield. They are on the path to doing that and are in an infinitely better place than they were when they appointed Xavi, whose only previously managerial experience was in Qatar with Al Sadd, but there are challenges ahead.\nDespite victories over Madrid and winning LaLiga, there is still the nagging feeling that big European performances are needed. And if Barça make it to those games, there are questions for Xavi: Will playing Cancelo and Balde as full-backs leave you too exposed in more open games? Which is his best centre-back pairing? Does he pick Oriol Romeu at the base of the midfield, or simply arrange his best midfielders? A box midfield four or a front three? Who starts on the right wing? Can he get the best out of an ageing Lewandowski?\nThe answers to those questions, and others, will shape his next 100 matches."}

This is called Facts vs. Feelings.\nThis time next week I'll be toiling away on the Week 6 edition of Facts vs. Feelings from a dimly lit hotel room in Bristol, Connecticut. And I can't wait.\nNot because the corporate-approved lodging is particularly luxurious. It's not. Or because I'm thrilled to welcome a morning that doesn't involve yelling at my kids to hurry up and brush their teeth so I can peel out of the driveway only to sit in a car line and stress about potential tardy slips. OK, well maybe a little (I truly do miss those adorable gremlins while I'm on the road, though).\nIt's because... IT'S FALL, Y'ALL!\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nLos Angeles might have the whole of my heart (and my money), but the City of Angels cannot deliver on autumn vibes. It wasn't until last year -- when I returned to campus for the second time as an ESPN employee -- that I realized how much I loved (and missed) a proper fall. I gasped at the foliage. I stared wide-eyed at the bushels (like, actual bushels!) of gourds lining the streets. I was taken back to my childhood and willingly wrapped myself in all of the pumpkin spice nostalgia.\nMy colleagues seemed charmed (if not a little startled) by my exuberance. Numerous co-workers leaned into it, generously taking me for scenic drives through some of the area's most breathtaking vistas. (One of whom is likely proofreading this article right now. Hi, Pierre. [Good morning, Liz and gremlins.] That detour past the old-timey cemetery was so stinking cool!) It never got old -- for me, at least. And I hope my genuine wonder rubbed off on them, serving as a potential reminder to take in the less-than-sophisticated (dare I say, \"basic\") joys of the season.\nI've been trying to manufacture that same cozy feeling in preparation for this weekend's trip. Numerous outings to the local Trader Joe's have resulted in an abundance of harvest-themed purchases. And while the bouquet of sunflowers on my desk looks beautiful and the pumpkin yogurt tasted surprisingly good... I want the real thing.\nI want to hear fall leaves crunch under a pair of cute boots. I want to sip apple cider and not sweat. And I really want the Bears to not embarrass themselves Thursday night. None of those things will happen, however, without taking action. I need to -- on my own -- venture outside of the Bristol bubble and discover all of the bucolic hiking trails and quaint roadside stands. And the Bears, well, they need to do a whole lot but should probably start with letting Justin Fields use his legs.\nThe same is true in fantasy. We're a month into the 2023 experiment and, speaking for myself, it has felt more like raking the lawn than snacking on pumpkin seeds. We have reached a point of transition. More than a few hot summer takes have begun to chill.\nThe emergence of new patterns and facts requires us to confront our feelings about what we thought was going to happen and instead get real about what is actually going on. Whether that means benching Joe Burrow (QB31) or getting behind Evan Engram (TE4); it's time to shed what isn't working and adventure toward something different. There's no guaranteeing these adjustments will lead to victorious gains, but neither will nervously standing still.\nSo, while that maple chai-scented room diffuser might smell great now, you're going to need something stronger to get you through the winter.\nAnthony Richardson, QB, Indianapolis Colts: Richardson is showing zero anxiety. This man is fearlessly running -- literally and figuratively -- toward his destiny. Even while in the grasp of Aaron Freaking Donald, Richardson is advancing the ball. His maturation as a passer might still be in its beginning stages, but the rookie has, thus far, recorded the fifth-highest pressured completion percentage (63.6%). That shows guts and intelligence. Richardson's physical tools are successfully translating to the NFL while manifesting a boon for fantasy investors.\nCongrats to all of those who believed from the jump because Richardson is currently the QB2 in fantasy points per game. That's what happens when a wildly gifted mobile passer is not only allowed but even encouraged to lean into his talent as a rusher. Richardson has executed 14 designed runs in three games, which includes all four of his touchdowns. (Can someone please forward this to Luke Getsy?) As a result, he has managed more fantasy points per game as a runner (12.38) than Joe Mixon, Rachaad White or Alexander Mattison. Additionally, his 29.60 fantasy points from Week 4 was the third-highest total by any QB this season (and 11 completions, tied for the fewest by any signal-caller in a full game so far this year).\nRichardson will have to shift some of his focus from the ground to the air versus the Titans on Sunday. Tennessee has allowed a completion percentage of nearly 71% and an average exceeding 241 passing yards (10th-most) per week to opposing quarterbacks. Mike Vrabel's gritty defensive front also managed to hold Deshaun Watson (the only dual-threat QB the team has faced, save a compromised Joe Burrow) to 16 rushing yards. It figures to be a close battle (+/- 1) but my money is on Richardson's continued ascent. He's a top-five fantasy play in Week 5.\nDe'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins: While we're on the topic of stocks rising ... holy heck, welcome to the NFL, De'Von Achane! The third-round selection out of Texas A&M followed up his 233-yard and four-TD effort in Week 3 by blazing his way to another 120 yards and two scores in Week 4. So, is this a fluke? Or is Achane the real deal?\nI'm leaning toward the latter. How does that genie fit back in the bottle? Achane's snap percentage has increased with each effort (0% - 8% - 42% - 66%). Meanwhile, Raheem Mostert's playing time has decreased since sharing the backfield with the explosive rookie (74% - 51% - 41%). The Dolphins -- like the rest of the modern NFL -- figure to go RBBC. However, Achane is proving to be the more effective rusher. His 11.4 yards per carry is as absurd as it is unsustainable. However, his 2.8 yards after contact per rush also ranks among the top three at the position.\nYou can't sit this guy. Not now. And certainly not as an 11-point favorite versus a reeling Giants squad that gave up 5.3 YPC to Seattle on Monday night. Achane has youth, juice and upside. He also has managed double-digit touches in back-to-back efforts. Consider the burgeoning star a top-12 fantasy RB this Sunday.\nMiles Sanders, RB, Carolina Panthers: If Miami's backfield is Fast & Furious, then Carolina's is giving Radiator Springs vibes. Sanders entered Week 4 with a groin injury, and although his effort deserves snaps, his output was worrisome. The Philly transplant managed a meager 19 rushing yards on 13 carries. While the aforementioned ailment certainly contributed to the vet's inefficiency, his rushing numbers have steadily decreased since the season opener. Sanders recorded 72 rushing yards in Week 1, but then a total of just 86 over his next three contests. Additionally, his 2.9 yards per carry ranks 37th among 44 qualifiers.\nIf there is a silver lining, it's Sanders' work in the passing game. Bryce Young is checking down on the regular. As a result, Sanders ranks third in team targets (23) and receptions (15), placing him among the top five at the position in both of those categories. But this offense has no juice. Between an unfavorable game script and Chuba Hubbard's pesky presence, Sanders is shaping up to be TD-dependent with little to no upside. He figures to further languish on the RB2/RB3 bubble when he takes on an improved (and rested) Lions defense in Week 5.\nMichael Wilson, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Meaningful impacts are hard to come by at the next level. Lord knows I'm still trying to make a positive one on my mother-in-law. Wilson, however, has delighted thus far in his pro campaign.\nThe Stanford alum has demonstrated enticing chemistry with Josh Dobbs, recording 50-plus receiving yards in three consecutive efforts. That stat becomes more impressive when noting that he's just one of 10 wideouts to accomplish such a feat. Wilson has additionally managed a top-15 aDOT (13.5 yards) along with the highest catch rate (88%) in the league. Furthermore, the rookie has outsnapped Rondale Moore in back-to-back games and managed to out-target the vet in his 7-76-0 effort at San Francisco this past Sunday. That arrow is pointing up, friends.\nA player with plus size and strength, Wilson is on his way to emerging as the ideal complement to Marquise Brown. It might not happen this week. And he'll still be saddled by Dobbs. Although with injuries mounting and byes upon us, now is the time to stash a rising star like Wilson. He's worth a speculative flex versus a Bengals defense that has allowed the ninth-most opponent yards per game (364.3).\nJordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings: High expectations often lead to disappointment. So does putting up a bagel on any given Sunday. Enter Addison. The 2021 Biletnikoff Award winner was the first rookie off of most fantasy draft boards. Touchdowns over his first two starts appeared to validate the preseason hype. But all that good juju came to a screeching halt when the 21-year-old failed to convert on his lone target in Week 4. Was it the result of uncharacteristic quarterback play and game flow? Probably. We still need to address the facts and recalibrate our feelings, though.\nAddison's 13.4% target share ranks third on his team (just ahead of Mattison's 12.1%) and 70th among wide receivers. His above average aDOT (12.9) and his efficiency in the red area have buoyed his fantasy numbers. That kind of usage screams boom/bust. The reality of Addison's situation has been tempered by the Vikings' pass-heavy game scripts. When Kirk Cousins puts the ball in the air 40-plus times, Addison is likely to draw at least five looks. Makes easy sense, right? That is not, however, something we can rely on.\nConsider Week 4 the wake-up call. That doesn't mean Addison is a cut candidate. Definitely not while we're weaving through bye weeks and subbing players in and out of IR spots. It does, however, mean thinking about Addison (at least for the moment) as more of an upside flex than an automatic WR3. He's a top-40 FF WR option in what's projected to be a high-scoring game (53.0) versus the Chiefs.\nDalton Schultz, TE, Houston Texans: Schultz has been quiet because his young QB hasn't needed a binky. C.J. Stroud doesn't mind letting it rip, averaging 8.0 yards per attempt (QB3) while registering the sixth-most air yards (953) on the season. From 20 yards out, however, the former Cowboy is proving to be his young QB's bestie.\nSchultz is tied for first in team red zone looks (31% RZ target share) and leads the Texans' offense in end zone opportunities (38% EZ target share). From a positional point of view, His four red zone targets -- as well as this three end zone looks -- is tied for fourth among tight ends.\nIs this chasing touchdowns? Absolutely. Do I like to do it? No, it feels dirty. But some of us -- I'm looking at you, Kyle Pitts and Darren Waller investors -- need to light a three-wicked Yankee candle and conjure up some fantasy goodness. The manifesting figures to continue at Atlanta, as the Falcons have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. I'm optimistically forecasting four grabs, 41 yards and a tuddy for Schultz.\nTyler Conklin, TE, New York Jets: As Travis Kelce has consistently reminded us, knowing not just how but when to shoot your shot is key. Conklin has been on my radar since Zach Wilson took over as the Jets' starter. It wasn't until the CMU product finished second in team targets versus the Chiefs, however, that I considered leaning into his streaming potential.\nConklin delivered a smattering of top-12 fantasy finishes over 2022, although most of his highs came without Wilson at the helm. Whatever was lacking between the two last year appears to have dissolved this go-round. Conklin ranks third on the team in offensive play percentage (76.2%) and second in team targets (17). He has managed 5-plus looks in each game over the past three weeks. Although those numbers are far from astonishing, only eight tight ends have managed the same or better. Welcome (again) to the TE hellscape.\nAvailable in over 90% of ESPN fantasy leagues, Conklin offers sneaky sleeper appeal in Week 5. He'll face a bruised and battered Broncos defense that has coaxed production out even the most broken offenses. Denver has given up the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, including a stunning 7-85-2 stat line to Cole Kmet in Week 4.\nI can't promise it will be pretty. But I know it's something different. Consider Conklin this week's newest borderline TE1.\nFollow Liz on social @LizLoza_FF"}

(0:41)\nASHBURN, Va. -- Sam Howell needed to make a choice.\nIt was a day before North Carolina's 2019 spring game, and the true freshman quarterback was playing rock, paper, scissors to determine which candidate for the starting quarterback job would get first chance at impressing the coaches.\nHowell won (he chose scissors), and it was the only opportunity he needed.\nHowell was competing with two redshirt freshmen for the job: Cade Fortin and Jace Ruder. Howell's talent was obvious. But coach Mack Brown didn't know how he'd handle the pressure.\n• The rise of Commanders QB Sam Howell\n• Claypool adds to Bears' legacy of issues\n• Rookie QB Richardson's poise key for Colts\n• Bills offense chasing history\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\nBut when Howell took the field, he delivered on one of his first throws.\n\"He turned it loose and zipped it. It was a perfect strike. We all said, 'Wow,'\" Brown said. \"That was one of the first times we knew he wasn't going to panic in front of people.\"\nThere were hiccups: Howell tossed three picks early in those spring practices. He didn't throw another one.\n\"I was worried about him losing his confidence,\" Brown said. \"He didn't even blink. Very mature for his age and experience. He does not get rattled.\"\nThose traits helped enable Howell to go from becoming North Carolina's first true freshman starting quarterback to being named the ACC's rookie of the year. His 38 touchdown passes set an FBS record for a freshman. He helped elevate the Tar Heels almost immediately before leaving after three years as the school's record holder in 27 different categories, including passing yards (10,283), passing touchdowns (92) and career passing efficiency (164.2).\nLooking back to that first season at North Carolina, it's clear why there's a belief Howell can succeed in the NFL. From his preparation to his demeanor, Howell displayed key traits that helped him go from a prized recruit, to early enrollee, to program-changer.\nIt's what Washington hopes he'll become for a franchise that hasn't had the same quarterback as full-time starter for more than three seasons since 1993, and hasn't had a first-team All-Pro quarterback since Joe Theismann in 1983.\n\"He's special,\" said Brown, whose first season at UNC coincided with Howell's, \"and he's the reason we're sitting here where we are. [North Carolina] won five games in the two years before us, then went to four straight bowls. If you ask me the No. 1 reason, it would be Sam Howell.\"\n.\nHOWELL SAT AT his locker on Sept. 27, casually chatting with a media member. Moments later, he was having a conversation with backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, whose locker was next to his. Next, someone from the equipment room wandered over for a brief exchange. It would have been difficult for an outsider to have known just three days earlier, Howell had thrown four interceptions in a 37-3 loss to the Buffalo Bills -- his worst performance as a pro.\n\"I put that game behind me and worry about the next game,\" Howell said of his philosophy. \"I go back to my process, doing what's always worked for me and never losing that confidence.\n\"Ever since the game ended Sunday, I was excited for the next game just because I'm ready for another opportunity, I'm ready to go out there and play like myself again.\"\nThe next game: He threw for 290 yards and one touchdown in an overtime loss to the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles.\nThat demeanor was shaped long ago. Howell has always been low-key about his success and didn't panic over his miscues.\n\"As far as getting emotional, that's never been him,\" said his father, Duke, who was his offensive coordinator at Sun Valley High School in the Charlotte area. \"When he was in high school, he would throw a pick and I was up in the booth and I'd get on the headset and all I could do was hear him breathe. He never said a word. I'd ask what happened and he'd say such and such. I'd go back and watch the film and, yeah, that did happen.\"\nIt's part of why Howell is comfortable in tense situations. In the last two minutes of the half and regulation this season, he has thrown for a league-high 375 yards with three touchdowns to one interception. Washington has scored 34 points in those situations, including a tying touchdown on the final play of regulation Sunday. The 23-year-old Howell said in the huddle his job is to, \"Just try to calm the storm.\"\nIt's what he did as a collegiate freshman as well. Howell created a buzz for himself and the Tar Heels program in the season opener -- a 24-20 comeback win over South Carolina.\n\"They were so much more talented,\" former Tar Heels offensive coordinator Phil Longo said of the Gamecocks.\nThe Tar Heels trailed by 11 entering the fourth quarter, but Howell completed 5 of 6 passes for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns in the final 15 minutes. He led two 90-yard drives. In his first collegiate game, Howell threw for 245 yards and two scores.\n\"When we were down, he'd say, 'Coach I got this,'\" Brown said. \"He never blinked.\"\n\"I never saw his face change,\" said Dyami Brown, a former Tar Heels receiver and current Commanders teammate. \"His demeanor was always the same. That helped us out because when you don't see a quarterback panicking or freaking out, you feel comfortable. He always kept his composure.\"\nTHE TRAITS HOWELL earned praise for later were evident in high school. Howell's father said he would watch his games on Hudl, a website that posts game video.\n\"He would stay on Hudl and he would always just study it,\" Duke said.\nDuke said he and the quarterbacks coach were once watching film and trying to decipher another team's coverage. Howell, then a sophomore, walked past, glanced at the screen, relayed the coverage and left.\n\"We were like, 'Yep, that's what they're running,'\" Duke said. \"He had a knack for it, but a lot of that is from a lot of work.\"\nIt didn't end when he got to college; it intensified.\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\n\"He was always in the building,\" Mack Brown said. \"He has no hobbies. He's a football junkie, a gym rat. Before he had his current girlfriend, it was Valentine's Day and I said, 'You got a date? Doing anything? He said, 'Yeah, I've got a date with Madden.' We used to laugh and say he's been in the building more than I have.\"\nDuke witnessed his son's football evolution in the spring of 2020, when he lived at home during the pandemic. He'd catch Howell on videoconferences with his Tar Heels coaches.\n\"Just the things he knew, that he had learned in one year, they put a lot on him,\" Duke said. \"He was talking about defensive fronts, knowing the fronts to check to a good play. Most quarterbacks are studying coverages. He was more IDing the front, making calls, what the protections are, checking the protections. Stuff like that; he was light years ahead from the year before.\"\nBecause Howell enrolled in January -- cutting short his senior year of high school -- he needed to catch up fast. Howell did not have a veteran quarterback to learn from. His two competitors were both redshirt freshmen. But, at a time when he should have been prepping for his final high school baseball season, he was displaying his promise in UNC's spring practices.\n\"We went to town on learning the offense,\" said Longo, now at Wisconsin. \"We set up a schedule to meet and he didn't miss a minute. He pounded the film and he'd come in every day and have a list of questions and have an agenda. He's just incredible from a want-to standpoint. His talent was ahead in the spring. Everything else was by the summer.\"\nPersonal quarterback coach Anthony Boone said that rapid growth is not surprising. He has experienced it while working with Howell as well.\n\"It's not something you had to tell him; he just did it,\" Boone said. \"He read online, 'This is what quarterbacks do,' and he took it to heart.\"\nHOWELL WAS RECRUITED by almost every big-time program, including Alabama, Ohio State and Clemson. Howell settled on Florida State but flipped to North Carolina after it hired Longo, previously at Ole Miss, as offensive coordinator.\nAt one point, Howell was going to also play baseball in college, a plan he abandoned after finding football success his freshman year.\nHowell is a natural athlete. As a high school junior, he was a pitcher whose fastball was clocked at 93 mph. Howell's ERA was 0.60, and pro scouts were interested.\nHe also played safety and linebacker in high school. One college coach told his dad he would have recruited him as a linebacker, had he not been a quarterback.\nAfter his sophomore year in college, Duke Howell bought Sam a set of golf clubs. Sam golfs only between February and June, not wanting it to interfere with the football season. Two years later, he accompanied his dad on a golf trip and shot an 82.\n\"Never had a lesson, but he's so competitive,\" Duke said. \"The average guy can't stay focused. [Sam] competes on every shot. Every shot. It's because he's mentally tough; it doesn't matter what sport.\n\"He's a highly focused individual. The biggest trait he has, obviously he's competitive, but his toughness is what he drives off of. Not just physically tough, but mentally tough.\"\nALL THE ELEMENTS that made Howell a success in the past have led the Commanders to believe he'll do the same in the NFL.\nBefore the 2022 draft, one member of the organization said they would have targeted Howell in the second or third round had they not already traded for Carson Wentz that offseason. Duke said the family was told pre-draft to expect Sam to be selected anywhere between the 20th and 40th picks.\nThen he lasted until the fifth round.\n\"There was never a doubt in my mind that Sam [could] produce or play at this level,\" Commanders offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy said. \"I was shocked that he went as late as he did.\"\nIn January, Rivera named Howell the starter going into offseason workouts. He never relinquished the position and, after the second preseason game, Rivera named him the starter for the season opener.\n\"He's now more than a serviceable quarterback,\" Rivera said. \"He's a guy that's growing. He's a guy that can win. ... I'm excited for it, excited for the team.\"\nHowell is showing that growth, whether by becoming more involved in film sessions -- communicating with receivers what he wants on certain routes -- or by understanding how to handle a situation better.\nIf Howell continues on an upward path, then Washington has a starting quarterback on an inexpensive contract through the 2025 season, allowing it to invest at other positions.\nOn Monday, Rivera said he expected Howell to have a strong performance against Philadelphia after struggling versus Buffalo. Howell had a career-best 76.4 quarterback rating -- a week after enduring his worst (18.4).\n\"He's a very resilient, very tough-minded young man. He bounces back very well at a lot of things,\" Rivera said. \"With him, you're going to have some really good positive plus moments, there's going to be some tough moments. He'll get better and better. I've always been confident in him and just been very optimistic about his potential.\""}
{"title": "'Where receivers go to die': 15 years later, does the quote about Chicago still ring true?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:19:41", "text": "Pat McAfee and his crew share their concerns about the Chicago Bears and QB Justin Fields. (2:48)\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Weeks ahead of the 2023 season, Chicago Bears receiver Darnell Mooney decided to rewatch one of the toughest moments of his career. It was Oct. 5, 2022, when the Bears hosted the Washington Commanders, and both offenses struggled. But with 30 seconds remaining and the Commanders leading 12-7, the Bears had a chance at a game-winning touchdown with a fourth-and-goal on the Washington 4.\nBears quarterback Justin Fields faked a toss and lofted a pass to Mooney, who jumped and nearly caught the ball while he was above the goal line for the touchdown, but he bobbled it and didn't secure the ball until he was driven out of the end zone by inches.\nWashington ball -- and game. Mooney said he was being \"accountable\" by watching every detail of that play as a new season neared, one with the promise of putting the bad memories of a three-win disaster in the rearview mirror. But with the Bears now at 0-4 after losing their 14th straight on Sunday, and more receiver drama unfolding with Chase Claypool, the echoes of a defining quote reverberated through Halas Hall.\nIt's the 15th anniversary of ex-Bears receiver Muhsin Muhammad telling Sports Illustrated that Chicago \"is where receivers go to die.\"\n• The rise of Commanders QB Sam Howell\n• Claypool adds to Bears' legacy of issues\n• Rookie QB Richardson's poise key for Colts\n• Bills offense chasing history\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\nSecond-year general manager Ryan Poles tried to change that narrative. He orchestrated a blockbuster trade in March, sending the No. 1 overall pick to the Carolina Panthers for a package that included DJ Moore, a true No. 1 receiver who's 26 and is being looked at to expedite the development of 24-year-old quarterback Justin Fields.\nBut as the Bears prepare for Thursday's rematch with the Commanders (8:15 p.m. ET, Prime Video), they rank 24th in passing yards (186.3 per game) after ranking last in 2022 (130.5). Moore is doing his part, ranking 14th at 75.3 receiving yards per game, but Mooney has eight catches total and Claypool's future in Chicago is in doubt.\nSeveral Bears receivers said they're aware of Muhammad's quote, and they believe the current unit could help change that perception. But history doesn't support their optimism. The Bears have had one first-team All-Pro receiver in the past 15 years in Brandon Marshall, and they've been unable to attract elite free agents because of a lack of quarterback consistency (18 starting QBs in the past 15 years) and a lack of success, with their last playoff win coming in 2011. One player agent said free agents take a hard look at who will be passing them the ball before signing.\n\"When you're talking about [wide receiver], it had been a huge issue for us because of the lack of stability at the most important position on the field,\" said Josh Lucas, the Bears' director of player personnel from 2015 to '22. \"We always knew as long as we didn't have an attractive quarterback that wide receivers wanted to come play with, we would be up against the eight ball.\"\nThe Bears acquired Claypool in a trade deadline move on Nov. 1, 2022, and he didn't come cheap. Chicago sent its second-round pick, which proved to be No. 32 overall -- essentially a first-rounder -- because Miami's first-rounder was stripped by a sanction.\nClaypool caught 18 passes for 191 yards and one score over 10 games for Chicago. His lackluster effort, especially when it came to blocking, was addressed by coach Matt Eberflus after a Week 2 loss. And Claypool's frustration was evident Friday when he said he didn't think he was being put in the best position to showcase his skill set. Two days later, he was a healthy scratch, although Eberflus said what Claypool said didn't have anything to do with him being inactive. He's also being asked not to attend team activities this week.\n\"We'll see where it goes from there,\" Eberflus said Monday. \"Ryan handles all those things, all those trades and transactions, and we'll see where it goes.\"\nConversely, Moore has been what the Bears needed. He had eight receptions for 131 yards and a touchdown Sunday to boost his season numbers to 19 catches, 301 yards and 2 TDs. He now has two games topping 100 receiving yards, becoming the first Bears receiver to do so in the first four weeks since Allen Robinson in 2020.\nMarshall said the connection between Fields and Moore reminds him of what he had with Jay Cutler.\n\"They have the chemistry already,\" Marshall said. \"You saw them in training camp.\"\nIf there was a silver lining Sunday for Chicago, it's that the offense showed some progress, especially Fields, who had his first 300-yard-passing game (335) and his first game with four passing touchdowns. The Bears entered Week 4 ranked 29th in yards per game at 250 and 26th in scoring at 15.7, and they gained 471 yards and scored 28. But that improvement did come against a Broncos team that yielded 70 points the previous week to the Miami Dolphins, and it did come in a 31-28 loss.\n\"When you're 0-4, no one's done the job well enough,\" Eberflus said. \"That's just facts.\n\"It's a results business, and we have to do a better job collectively as a group.\"\nWithout Claypool, there will be pressure on Mooney to regain his 2021 form, when he caught 81 passes for 1,055 yards and four TDs. But optimism about a Fields-Mooney connection faded last season when he caught 40 passes for 493 yards and two scores.\nThat's one of the reasons Mooney wanted to revisit the play vs. Washington: to learn from his mistakes. He was optimistic the addition of Moore would allow this group to rehabilitate the image of the Bears' receiving corps, but that was before the Claypool saga.\n\"I don't believe ... where it's like, 'Oh my goodness, this team is cursed,''' Marshall said in reference to Muhammad's quote. \"I just believe that you go out there and do your job.\"\nClaypool's absence also means receivers such as rookie Tyler Scott will have to contribute sooner than expected.\n\"I definitely heard [Muhammad's quote],\" Scott said. \"I don't put too much stock into it. That's how he felt, and that's his opinion.\n\"At the end of the day, each generation comes and everybody has a new opportunity. That's how I see it. Why can't you change that stigma or culture that Chicago may have, or that he felt that they had?\"\nMarshall and Alshon Jeffery were the Bears' most recent Pro Bowl receivers in 2013. In the nine seasons since, Chicago receivers have ranked 28th in targets, 31st in receiving yards and 30th in first-down receptions, and they are tied for 28th in receiving touchdowns.\nSince the start of modern NFL free agency in 1993, the Bears' biggest free agent acquisition at wide receiver was Robinson in 2018. Like Moore, Marshall had come via trade, and the Bears drafted Jeffery.\nLucas said the timing was perfect to sign Robinson. Mitch Trubisky, whom the Bears traded up to take at No. 2 overall, was entering his second season and Matt Nagy was taking over as head coach. Nagy had spent the previous 10 seasons under Andy Reid in Philadelphia and Kansas City.\nRobinson thrived with 1,147 yards and seven touchdowns in 2019 and 1,250 yards and six TDs the following year. But Trubisky left as a free agent for the Buffalo Bills in 2021, and Robinson grew unhappy over his contract situation and left as a free agent for the Los Angeles Rams last season.\nThe Bears are hoping Fields can develop into the type of quarterback who can attract free agents, but there's another scenario in which Fields' future may lie elsewhere. It's possible the Bears could land the No. 1 overall pick for the second year in a row. Chicago not only has its No. 1 pick, but also Carolina's. The Bears and Panthers are the only 0-4 teams in the NFL.\nIf that happens, the Bears would be in position to draft the overwhelming choice for the top pick in USC quarterback Caleb Williams, which would put Fields on the trading block.\nAnd while Williams might help attract free agents, it would mean another spin on the QB revolving door. Muhammad's frustration with the Bears was linked to the quarterback carousel he dealt with over three seasons (2005-07), having played with Kyle Orton, Rex Grossman, Brian Griese and Jeff Blake. That played a role in Muhammad's output taking a step back from the first nine years of his career in Carolina, where he earned first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors.\n\"We'd have to take a hard look at who's playing quarterback for them before signing with Chicago,\" one agent told ESPN. \"Few receivers can truly produce no matter [who's throwing them the ball], and even then there's no guarantee that will continue if the quarterback situation isn't good.\n\"I wouldn't be doing my job if I got them to a place where their career could fall off a cliff.\"\nESPN Jets reporter Rich Cimini contributed to this report."}

Adams continued to appear unstable as he walked off the field with the help of a team staffer on each side.\nA few minutes later, during a wild scene on the Seahawks' sideline, Adams emerged from the medical tent and became livid, yelling at one of the NFL's unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants while being held back by the team's head athletic trainer and two members of the Seahawks' security staff.\n\"By the time they got all the assessments done, he couldn't play,\" coach Pete Carroll said when asked about Adams' frustration. \"Somebody said something that wasn't with us. It was somebody else that he might have responded to. I'm not sure about that.\"\nAdams still appeared heated while being led off the field. He briefly stopped to exchange words with an apparent heckler then high-fived a Seahawks fan wearing a No. 33 Adams jersey before disappearing into the tunnel.\nOn Wednesday, Adams apologized to the doctor, saying he \"did everything right\" and thanking him for his actions.\npic.twitter.com/6GqMn5hbod\nHeading into Monday, Adams had missed 28 of a possible 53 regular-season games because of injury since the Seahawks acquired him in a blockbuster trade with the New York Jets in 2020. He said last week that he briefly but legitimately considered retiring after tearing his quad tendon in Week 1 of last season, citing all the injuries he has dealt with over the past three seasons, which includes two torn shoulder labrums.\nAdams, 27, had two tackles and a near sack of Jones on the opening drive before he left the game.\nESPN's Brady Henderson contributed to this report."}

(1:06)\nSAN DIEGO -- The Los Angeles Lakers might have the Nuggets on their minds this week, but Denver coach Michael Malone said the defending NBA champions have nothing but respect for the Lakers and have turned the page from the Western Conference finals sweep of Los Angeles.\nMalone was asked Wednesday about how some of the Lakers talked about his team this week and how they have been motivated by trash talk from Malone and the Nuggets all summer.\n\"Oh, they're talking about us? That was what, four months ago?\" Malone said after practice at the Nuggets' training camp at UC San Diego. \"I can't speak for anybody in L.A., but if they're still worried about us, that's on them.\n\"This is a new season, a new challenge, and it was a hell of a series against them. I know it was a 4-0 sweep, but all those games seemed like they went down to the wire. We have tremendous respect for that team. I have tremendous respect for Darvin Ham as a coach and the job that he did. But yeah, I don't listen to any of that stuff. I don't know what they're saying, and if we're on their minds, then I guess that's on them.\"\nThere certainly will be added spice to the season opener between the Nuggets and Lakers in Denver on Oct. 24. Anthony Davis told Spectrum SportsNet during Monday's media day that he found the trash talk from the Nuggets after their sweep of the Lakers to be \"motivational.\"\n\"There was just so much of that going on,\" Davis said. \"It was like, 'All right, we get it, y'all won.' But me and [LeBron James] had some conversations like, 'We can't wait [to play them again].'\"\nDuring the Western Conference finals, Malone said the narrative was much more about the Lakers than the Nuggets. After the sweep, Malone was asked whether he believed the Nuggets would be overshadowed by their Finals opponent, the Miami Heat, much like he felt about the national chatter being focused on the Lakers during the conference finals.\n\"If anybody is still talking about the Lakers in the NBA Finals, that's on them. They've gone fishing. We're still playing,\" Malone said before the Finals.\nAt the Denver championship parade, Malone was introduced as \"the Lakers' daddy.\" Also, during an interview on the \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" Malone joked that he was contemplating retirement after the win, a response to James telling ESPN he was considering retirement during the offseason.\nFormer Nuggets forward Bruce Brown, who signed with the Indiana Pacers as a free agent during the offseason, said on the \"Run Your Race\" podcast in July that it \"never felt like we were gonna lose any game\" when asked how close each contest was against the Lakers in the conference finals.\n\"I think everybody knows it was pointed at us,\" Lakers swingman Austin Reaves said of the Nuggets' comments after Tuesday's practice. \"They can do it indirectly if they want, but I think it was very obvious to the public eye. That's why everybody was talking about it.\"\nJames posted on his Instagram in June, without acknowledging Malone -- his former assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers -- by name: \"I hear I'm on your mind that much, huh??? I mean I guess I see why ... Enjoy your light but just know I'm the SUN.\"\nIn addition, Ham joined the \"This League Uncut\" podcast the following month and said, \"This s--- ain't over.\"\nMalone wasted no time on Monday's media day saying that Denver is leaving last season in the past and focusing on trying to repeat. The Nuggets, however, will spend one more night celebrating their title when they receive their rings and raise the championship banner before facing the Lakers in the opener.\nAs to whether there is a budding rivalry between the Lakers and Nuggets, who have faced each other twice in the Western Conference finals since 2020, Malone said no.\n\"That's not a rivalry,\" Malone said. \"I mean, you can't play a team in the Western Conference finals twice in the last couple of years and think it's a rivalry.\n\"When I think of rivalry, I think Boston-L.A. I think of the Knicks and the Miami Heat back in the day. But I don't welcome it or not welcome it [with the Lakers]. I'm on 2023-24. I'm not living four months ago.\""}

Left-hander Yusei Kikuchi, one of four Blue Jays who made 31 or more starts this season, was greeted by a single from Max Kepler. Pinch-hitter Donovan Solano walked, Carlos Correa put the Twins up with his single, and pinch-hitter Willi Castro's double-play groundout got another run on the board as Minnesota plated both its runs in what ultimately was a 2-0 series-clinching win.\nThe decision to remove Berrios was a hotly debated topic during the game and remained so after it.\n\"He had electric stuff. Tough to take him out,\" Schneider said. \"But I think with the way they're constructed, you want to utilize your whole roster. It didn't work out. You can look at it broadly and say it didn't work out because they scored two runs when we did make a change. You can also look at the fact it didn't work out and we didn't take advantage of at-bats we had with runners in scoring position.\n\"So you can sit here and second-guess me, second-guess the organization, second-guess anybody. I get that. I get that. And it's tough. And it didn't work out for us today or yesterday. But that's baseball sometimes. There's 29 teams that are going to say the same thing when the season's over.\"\nBerrios ended up throwing 47 pitches, allowing three hits and ultimately taking the loss.\n\"I just control what I can control,\" Berrios told reporters. \"I pitched my ass off.\n\"I understand the move [to remove him], and I have to deal with that.\"\nBlue Jays infielder Whit Merrifield said he didn't like what happened.\n\"I hated it, frankly,\" he said, according to SI.com. \"It's not what cost us the game, but it's the kind of baseball decisions that are taking away from managers and baseball, at this stage of the game.\"\nAdded Vlad Guerrero Jr. through an interpreter, via the Toronto Star: \"Obviously everybody was surprised. Everybody was surprised by the decision, but there are things you can't control. You can ask yourself many times, it was a hard decision, but yeah, we were surprised.\"\nToronto has now been swept in the wild-card round in two straight postseasons under Schneider and for the third time in four seasons overall.\n\"We got beat up two years in a row in the playoffs,\" Bo Bichette said. \"So I think there's a lot of reflection needed, from players but from the organization from top to down. Everybody needs to reflect to see what we can do better. So I think that's the next step.\"\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."}

{"title": "How Texas has gotten bigger, better under Steve Sarkisian", "date": "2023-10-05 13:32:58", "text": "Paul Finebaum breaks down the high stakes for Oklahoma and Texas in their upcoming matchup. (0:40)\nSteve Sarkisian had one key piece of feedback for athletic director Chris Del Conte when he studied his potential roster while interviewing for the Texas coaching job.\n\"We need bigger humans in our program, and we need more of them,\" he recalled at Big 12 media day in 2022. \"The numbers weren't the way I would've liked it and the body structure ... there's just a lot to it.\"\nSarkisian's first year seemed to bear that out. The Longhorns finished 5-7, and he said multiple times there needed to be a lot of new faces on the roster. And there was a reason: The Longhorns' highly touted recruiting classes in 2018 and 2019 brought in nine offensive linemen. But by Sarkisian's first year, four were no longer on the roster.\nNow, as No. 3 Texas sits at 5-0 heading into the annual Red River Rivalry showdown against No. 12 Oklahoma (noon ET, ABC/ESPN App), it'll be the biggest test to date of Sarkisian's project to return Texas to glory.\nLast year, Texas won the golden hat for the first time since 2018 in devastatingly dominant fashion, handing Oklahoma its biggest shutout loss in school history (49-0). It was the highest-scoring game for Texas in the 118-game series. But inconsistency plagued the Longhorns the rest of the season, going 4-3 from then on, en route to an 8-5 finish.\nSo far, those big humans are making their presence felt in Texas' strong start (its first 5-0 start since making the national title game in 2009). On defense, 6-foot-4, 362-pound T'Vondre Sweat is a run-stopping force who has helped the Longhorns allow just 3.07 yards per carry, their fewest in their first five games since 2010, according to ESPN Stats & Information. On the other side, an offensive line that returns all five starters from a year ago averages just over 6-4 and about 325 pounds. Texas is one of seven teams nationally to average more than 190 rushing yards (191.8) and allow fewer than 95 (94.6) per game.\nSarkisian's offense has always been the star attraction. It attracts talent, with his first recruiting class headlined by Ja'Tavion Sanders and Xavier Worthy, who instantly became two of Texas' best and flashiest offensive weapons. He added some strength the next year with DJ Campbell and Kelvin Banks, two of those offensive linemen, who were the most highly rated recruits in the '22 class, according to ESPN Recruiting.\nBut the biggest difference in this year's success over past years has been the defense, which will be tested by a Sooners offense that is No. 3 nationally in scoring (averaging 47.4 points) and No. 7 in passing (352.4 yards).\nThe Longhorns have added big pieces on that side of the ball. In 2023, linebacker Anthony Hill Jr. was a five-star signee who ranked behind only quarterback Arch Manning in the Texas class. He has already made a big impact with two sacks on third-down plays against Alabama, including on the Tide's final offensive drive to help Texas seal the win. Senior transfer Jalen Catalon came from Arkansas and has provided a physical presence at free safety, making seven tackles against Alabama and a big hit on Saturday against Kansas that led to a fumble.\nPlugging newcomers in alongside stars like Jaylan Ford, the preseason Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, has allowed the Longhorns the luxury of newfound depth to rotate heavily.\n\"I think it's been huge,\" Sarkisian said this week of the defense. \"We've gone through first halves of games where we played upwards of 30 guys. Sometimes you don't feel the effect of that rotation in the first half. But naturally, you look at some of these fourth quarters we've been having now. ... I think we're more fresh physically. We're more fresh mentally.\"\nAs a result, the defense is stifling opponents. Compared to their first five games over the past 20 years, the Longhorns are allowing the fewest yards per game since 2010 (290.8). They're pressuring opposing QBs on 37% of plays, best for the Longhorns since ESPN has been tracking the stat in 2011. Opposing QBs are off target on 18% of their passes and have completed just 53.5% of their passes.\nSenior Jahdae Barron said the players can trust that whoever is in the game can get the job done.\n\"When we look to the left and right of each other, we know that we are all brothers, and we've all been through so much throughout the summer, and we know that we are a family,\" Barron said. \"We've built a bond on and off the field so we know how to play for one another and we just keep playing.\"\nIt also has allowed the offense to keep from panicking. On Saturday, the Longhorns led Kansas just 13-7 at halftime. By the end of the game, it was 40-14.\nA year ago, it was likely either running back Bijan Robinson or receiver Worthy would be the stars quarterback Quinn Ewers had to lean on in key moments. On Saturday, Georgia transfer Adonai Mitchell had a career day, catching 10 passes for 141 yards and a touchdown, with Worthy adding seven catches for 93 yards.\nSophomore running back Jonathon Brooks has eclipsed the 100-yard mark in three straight games, including a 218-yard, two-touchdown performance against Kansas. Sanders, who was injured against the Jayhawks, should return and already has two 100-yard receiving games this year as a rare talent at tight end, with five catches for 114 yards against Alabama.\nMitchell was quick to say how much having Worthy on the other side helps him.\n\"It's crazy how much attention he gets and how the defense just has to respect who he is,\" Mitchell said. But Sarkisian said the presence of Mitchell is a difference-maker for Worthy, too.\n\"For Xavier to catch seven balls last year, it would take about 14 or 15 attempts in his direction because everybody knew we have to throw it there,\" Sarkisian said after the Kansas game. \"Now all of a sudden, when you have a complementary receiver on the other side, sooner or later people are going to start paying more attention to No. 5 [Mitchell] and with JT [Sanders] and with Jordan [Whittington] and now the running game with Jonathon the way he's running, now we've got a really good variety of players that the ball can get spread around to.\"\nOf course, all of that helps Ewers, who has an embarrassment of riches and doesn't have to do it all. He's averaging 271 passing yards per game with 10 touchdowns to just one interception. Opponents have gotten pressure on just 24% of his dropbacks, Texas' lowest rate since 2016.\nEwers also has started to trust his running ability when all those offensive threats attract coverage, rushing for 30- and 29-yard touchdowns in the past two games, two of his four rushing scores this year.\n\"He's figured out, 'Man, maybe I'm a little faster than I thought.'\" Sarkisian said.\nIt's all part of what Ewers said was a new dedication this offseason to getting in better shape.\n\"This is where I want to be,\" Ewers said. \"I think I took a lot of time analyzing myself last year and I want to be able to do stuff like this and I think I really worked on it this offseason. For it to start working out, it's pretty cool.\"\nSarkisian said on Monday he's preparing for a bit of a chess match against Oklahoma's Brent Venables, who he said has \"been doing it too long at too high of a level to think they weren't going to get that thing fixed\" after last year's 6-7 meltdown, in which they finished 122nd in total defense, allowing 461 yards per game.\n\"They've got a lot of defense,\" Sarkisian said. \"They've got a lot of coverages. They've got a lot of pressure packages. So you know, it's definitely challenging on that front. Especially when it's all on the same accord and working well together.\"\nBut Texas has been building for this moment. In the two titans' final season in the Big 12, they're both 5-0 for only the third time in the rivalry's history.\n\"We know it's going to be a great challenge,\" Sarkisian said. \"We're looking forward to it, looking forward to seeing our fans in Dallas for, in my opinion, the best setting in college football. This is going to be an awesome environment.\""}
{"title": "MLB Wild Card Series: Analysis and takeaways from a FOUR-sweep day!", "date": "2023-10-05 13:35:49", "text": "Well, that was fast!\nOn the second day of Wild Card week, all four series were decided: The Texas Rangers kicked off the day by eliminating the Tampa Bay Rays with a dominant 7-1 win, and the Minnesota Twins won their first playoff series since 2002 by sweeping the Toronto Blue Jays.The Arizona Diamondbacks knocked off the NL Central-winning Milwaukee Brewers, and the Philadelphia Phillies dominated the Miami Marlins in front of a raucous home crowd.\nWe've got you covered with our takeaways on each series -- and what's next for the four teams eliminated Wednesday.\nKey links: Day 1 | Everything you need to know | Bracket | Picks | Watch on ESPN, ABC\nTwins 2, Blue Jays 0: Sometimes the analysis is simple: The Twins pitched well, the Blue Jays didn't hit well -- and the Twins swept two low-scoring games for their first postseason series win since 2002. Give credit to a Minnesota pitching staff that has ability to make a deep postseason run. Pablo Lopez and Sonny Gray were both excellent in their starts and match up favorably with any team's top two starters. The bullpen has several guys who can pump it up into the upper 90s. That relief corps has the ability to be dominant this October (although manager Rocco Baldelli's insistence on using Louie Varland in high-leverage situations may bite him at some point). The question is whether the Twins can score enough runs -- but don't discount their chances of knocking off the Astros in the ALDS. As for the Jays, they remain without a postseason win in the Vladimir Guerrero Jr./Bo Bichette era, and you have to wonder whether the team needs a major offensive overhaul in the offseason. -- David Schoenfield\nRangers 7, Rays 1: Give the Rangers credit: They lost that last series of the season in Seattle, costing them the AL West title, and then had to fly cross-country to play a tough Rays team that had the best home record in the AL. We saw the best version of the Rangers, especially with Jordan Montgomery and Nathan Eovaldi combining to allow just one run in 17⅔ innings. We saw a lineup that has power up and down the lineup -- including rookie Evan Carter, who is having an October breakout.\nWhat we didn't learn: Can the bullpen close out a tight game? The starters went deep and the games weren't close. And manager Bruce Bochy's decision to bat Robbie Grossman third against right-handed starters, with some other good hitters to choose from, remains more than a little questionable given Grossman has hit .182 with a .569 OPS against righties the past two seasons. We'll see if that continues in Baltimore. -- Schoenfield\nArizona 5, Brewers 2: What we witnessed during a very brief NL wild card round in Milwaukee might well have been a young, talented team embarking on a new chapter in its history. Arizona's sweep was impressive -- not because its flashy athleticism was on full blast but because the team showed the big stage was not too big. It's a cliched observation to be sure, but it fits.\nThe Diamondbacks displayed professional, disciplined at-bats in both games. The quality of their at-bats improved as the games progressed, and they got to Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta the second time through the order. They did it with power, too, always a good formula for postseason winning.\nThe Arizona bullpen was impressive in the two games, with manager Torey Lovullo showing no compunction about trotting out a parade of guys you've probably never heard of. But Kevin Ginkel, Joe Mantiply, Miguel Castro and others have all gotten rolling late in the season -- and when a bullpen gathers steam in the playoffs, anything can happen.\nTo be sure, it's a gut-punch loss for Milwaukee, which squandered numerous scoring chances with multiple runners on base and so come away from a 94-win season with little to show for it. But credit for that perhaps goes to Arizona too, which did an outstanding job managing situations. If the D-Backs keep that up over the next week, this matchup against the heavily favored Dodgers might be an awful lot of fun. -- Bradford Doolittle\nPhillies 7, Marlins 1: The Phillies dominated in all phases of the game in their sweep of the Marlins. In Game 2, Aaron Nola cruised through seven scoreless innings and the offense ripped out six extra-base hits, including a 110-mph home run from J.T. Realmuto and a Bryson Stott grand slam to break the game open. Can we read too much into these two games? Not really, as the Marlins had the weakest offense of any of the playoff times. Still, the Phillies certainly look like the team that rolled through the NL side of the bracket last season -- except this team is a little deeper, better defensively and still has that raucous home crowd behind them. This sets up what could be the most exciting series of the postseason: Phillies versus Braves. The Braves won the season series 8 to 5, including four out of seven in September. You can throw that out the window. It's 0-0 now. -- Schoenfield"}

This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- DoolittleHouston AstrosNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champsALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield Ready for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000.

Judging all 30 clubs one month later »\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Remember '21. If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- DoolittleMinnesota TwinsNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champsALDS opponent: Astros (46.7% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 10.5% | Caesars odds: +2000Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins stay healthy enough? Everything went Minnesota's way in the opening round, but health remains a question. Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis. Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- GonzalezEditor's PicksPassan: Why all 12 MLB playoff teams can win the World Series -- and which one actually will3dJeff PassanOctober ace tiers: Ranking the top 15 starting pitchers for the 2023 MLB playoffs5dKiley McDanielAn A+ for the O's ... and SIX F's!? Full regular-season grades for all 30 MLB teams8dDavid Schoenfield2 RelatedWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- DoolittleTexas RangersNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild cardALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- SchoenfieldHow the Rangers got to OctoberAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »Passan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- DoolittleNational LeagueAtlanta BravesNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champsNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- SchoenfieldThe year of the HR-crushing BravesCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.MLB execs on how to beat Atlanta » Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- SchoenfieldWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- DoolittleLos Angeles DodgersNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champsNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 23The one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- GonzalezL.A.'s dominant transition yearCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs. Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs » 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- DoolittlePhiladelphia PhilliesNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild cardNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- GonzalezEarly MLB free agency rankingsNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason. Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- DoolittleArizona DiamondbacksNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild cardNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- SchoenfieldHow the D-backs learned to contendWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »Passan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers (50.2% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista.

Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan »\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree »\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm »\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}
{"title": "WNBA Finals predictions: Can Aces repeat or will Liberty win first title?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:53:43", "text": "Seven of 18 WNBA Finals have gone the distance since the best-of-five format started in 2005. With the top two seeds and preseason favorites playing for the 2023 WNBA championship, will we see an eighth rendition of a winner-take-all Game 5 when the Las Vegas Aces face the New York Liberty?\nWe couldn't ask for a better setup, with a matchup of superstars in their primes -- Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson and New York's Breanna Stewart -- as two teams with the top talent and what appears to be the best chemistry meet. The Finals will begin Sunday in Las Vegas at 3 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN App.\nThe most recent five-game WNBA Finals was in 2019, when the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun. That was a matchup of the top two teams in the standings, as was the case in 2016 and 2017, when the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx went the distance and alternated in taking home the trophy.\nThis season, the Liberty beat the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup final, while the teams split their four regular-season meetings. They played four times in August, so those games are still fresh in their minds.\nAlmost anywhere you look in this series, you'll see a No. 1 pick or an MVP or a statistical leader -- or someone who is all three.\nBoth coaches are former WNBA players; Las Vegas' Becky Hammon led the Aces to the league title last year, while New York's Sandy Brondello guided the Phoenix Mercury to the 2014 championship.\nThe fan bases come at this from a different perspective. The Aces' franchise dates to the start of the WNBA in 1997 as the Utah Starzz, but their time in Las Vegas has been short and successful. They moved from San Antonio to the Strip in 2018, and they are appearing in the Finals for the third time.\nNew York, on the other hand, is the only still-existing original WNBA franchise that has not won a title. While the Liberty players -- none of whom has been with the team since before 2019 -- might not really feel that historical weight, the longtime Liberty fans do.\nSo which superteam will be the 2023 champion? ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel preview the Finals.\nVoepel: Stewart's shooting woes have been a surprise. She was at 46.5% overall and 35.5% from behind the arc in the regular season. In the Liberty's six playoff games, those percentages have dropped to 35.6 and 20.7. Of course, if she got a lot of her misses out of the way before the Finals, that's good news for the Liberty.\nPhilippou: Having covered the Liberty-Sun series in person, New York seemed to develop grit in real time to overcome a 0-1 deficit versus an uber-tough Connecticut squad and win three straight games, including two at Mohegan Sun Arena. Different people stepped up in different moments for the Liberty, but for the most part, they stayed poised to close out such a competitive series in four games.\nI am surprised the Liberty's bench hasn't seen more minutes in the playoffs, since their depth seemed to be an advantage when considering New York as a contender earlier this season. Does that change against the Aces? Kayla Thornton's toughness and energy can turn around a game, as can Marine Johannes' shooting, and Stefanie Dolson adds post depth against a team that doesn't have a ton of it. Johannes had a stellar outing versus the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup championship, but she has played only 42 minutes this postseason.\nPelton: In addition to seconding what Alexa said, I agree Stewart's postseason slump has been a surprise. When the Seattle Storm lost to Las Vegas in last year's semifinals, it was the first time a healthy Stewart had been knocked out of the playoffs since 2017. And even then, Stewart set a playoff record with 42 points in the final game of a hard-fought series. Going back to UConn, and including EuroLeague competition, Stewart has almost always been at her best when the stakes are the highest. They don't come much higher than in this series.\nPhilippou: Yes, the Finals are a whole new series, but those games -- particularly the August ones -- showed us a lot about how these teams match up. That said, I expect Wilson to play closer to how she did Aug. 28 against the Liberty (23 points) than say how she fared Aug. 6, when she tallied nine points on 2-for-14 shooting and tweeted, \"I doubt I'll ever shoot 2-14 again I pray I don't lol.\" Since then, she has shot below 40% just once, and she has been playing on another level over the past two months or so. The Liberty have excellent defenders in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, but they'll still have their hands full trying to slow down Wilson.\nVoepel: The Aces' 98-81 victory over the Liberty on June 29 doesn't have much bearing on this series, as Candace Parker was still playing for the Aces, and Jones wasn't quite in the playing form she is now. The other four matchups, all in August, are likely indicative of what we will see in the Finals. The Aces didn't play well in their first game in Brooklyn nor in the Commissioner's Cup final in Las Vegas. Those will be games the Aces will review in preparation because they were far from their best in both.\nThe Aces and Liberty split their regular-season series, but New York beat Las Vegas in their Aug. 15 Commissioner's Cup championship game, which doesn't count toward WNBA standings or statistics. While the Aces are 2-3 against New York, they went 37-4 against the rest of the league, and only the Liberty had multiple wins against Las Vegas, per ESPN Stats & Information.\nPelton: It's interesting that head-to-head results haven't been particularly predictive of Finals results. Since the WNBA went to a single playoff table in 2016, and not including the shortened 2020 Wubble season, teams that won the regular-season series have gone just 2-4 in the Finals. And both of those winners, the 2018 Storm and last year's Aces, also had home-court advantage in the Finals. However, we've never seen teams play each other this often before the Finals. All of those previous head-to-head series were three games rather than the five times Las Vegas and New York have already met this year.\nPelton: Given the firepower on both sides, I think it's more about which team can consistently get stops. New York was 15-0 in the regular season (and 1-0 so far in the playoffs) when holding opponents to 95 points per 100 possessions or fewer. One of those games was the Aug. 6 blowout win over Las Vegas that represented the Aces' worst offensive performance of the season in terms of points per possession -- and the Liberty's best on defense.\nPhilippou: Defensively, for the reasons Pelton stated, but also because if you ask both Hammon and Brondello, they'd say defense wins championships. Not just by the pure nature of getting stops and keeping an opponent off the scoreboard, but for these two teams in particular, defense (and defensive rebounding) fuels offense on the other end, especially in transition.\nThe Aces have had the best defensive rating in both the regular season and playoffs, but they allowed the Liberty to score at least 80 points in all of their previous meetings except one -- Aug. 17, the only time Las Vegas beat New York in their four matchups that month.\nTop-seeded Las Vegas and No. 2 seed New York dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, they ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nVoepel: The Aces have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Wilson, but she has given much praise to Kiah Stokes as the true anchor of Las Vegas' defense. The Aces' Jackie Young is one of the league's best defensive guards and at 6 feet tall actually can take on just about anyone. Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark is also a versatile defender.\nIt makes sense to say defense will prevail in this series, for all the reasons Alexa and Kevin point out. Still, let's add this: The Aces can be like a runaway train on offense, and that can take over games. The Aces won playoff games scoring 97 points and 64 points, which shows how effective they can be on both ends of the court.\nPhilippou: Jones' emergence into her MVP-level self is arguably the single biggest development that has catapulted this Liberty team into a contender. In the postseason, she has had six double-doubles in as many games; and in the second half alone of Game 4 in the semifinals, Jones came up with 20 points and eight rebounds.\nGoing up against the Mystics' and Sun's frontcourts is different than facing that of the Aces' (especially with Wilson being unstoppable as of late). But if Jones can play like she did in New York's August meetings versus Las Vegas, the Liberty are much better positioned to win.\nAnother X factor is Liberty forward Betnijah Laney, who has scored at least 19 points in all but one of New York's postseason games and will be critical to helping contain the Aces' high-powered guards.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nVoepel: Jones is the biggest X factor overall in the series. The biggest for Las Vegas is Kelsey Plum's 3-point shooting, because that can really fuel the Aces. Plum averaged 2.4 3s per game and shot 38.9% from behind the arc in the regular season; during the Aces' five playoff games, she was at 3.2 and 42.1%. Plum, Young and Chelsea Gray all can do damage from long range, but if Plum gets in a groove, it makes Las Vegas' offense all the harder to stop.\nPelton: Stokes. Over the course of the season, as well as the playoffs, the Aces' starting lineup with Stokes in place of the injured Parker -- the group that led Las Vegas to last year's title -- has remained dominant.\nHowever, that hasn't been the case against the Liberty. In 45 minutes across the five meetings, the Aces were outscored by 19 points with their starting five on the court. Although Hammon can always go small with Clark in Stokes' place, not being able to keep Stokes on the court will leave Las Vegas painfully thin.\nPhilippou: Liberty in 5. I went back and forth and wouldn't be shocked to be proved wrong. But at the end of the day, it's hard to ignore how much the Liberty dominated the Aces in their most recent meetings in August. Plus, New York had a much tougher road to the championship series, and being battle-tested will pay off. Jones won MVP of the Commissioner's Cup championship game thanks to her dominance in the paint on both ends and on the glass, and I project her to take home Finals MVP should the Liberty win.\nVoepel: Aces in 5. This feels like the 2016 and 2017 Lynx-Sparks Finals, when there was such a good case for both teams to win both years. They split, with the Sparks winning in 2016 and the Lynx in 2017. The Sparks won 2016's Game 5 on Minnesota's home court, which is so hard to do in the clinching game of a playoff series. Then the Lynx won in Minneapolis in 2017's Game 5 -- although at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena, because Target Center was being refurbished. The WNBA's most recent Finals Game 5 was in 2019, when Washington beat Connecticut on the Mystics' home court.\nIt seems like this year, the Aces -- who celebrated their 2022 title in Connecticut -- might win it at home.\nPelton: Liberty in 4. That's not a reflection on how close the series might be, but lower-seeded teams that have won the Finals in the best-of-five era have been more likely to close out at home than win a Game 5 on the road. If Parker were healthy, I'd be inclined to pick Las Vegas. But New York has been the (slightly) better team since the All-Star break, and I don't expect Stewart's shooting slump to carry over into the Finals.\nRamona Shelburne: Aces in 5. Las Vegas misses Parker, and this matchup is going to be difficult. But the Aces are the defending champs until someone takes the title from them. You've got to knock them off, and that's difficult over a best-of-five series."}

The Rockets have surrounded them with veterans in Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jeff Green, and Jock Landale. (They nearly snagged Brook Lopez from the Milwaukee Bucks, sources said.)\nThe veterans are around to teach habits and help the Rockets win more; Houston owes its 2024 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, protected for the top four draft slots -- the first of two painful debts stemming from the Daryl Morey regime's ill-fated 2019 swap of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook in a desperate bid to placate Harden. By the cold reality of incentives, the losing has to stop.\nMeanwhile, Houston's front office already has to look years ahead: Is it even possible to pay all six of those young guys second contracts under this new collective bargaining agreement -- even with restricted free agency still a powerful cudgel? If none of those players becomes a No. 1-level superstar, how do the Rockets find one? Or does the talent fit so well as to compensate for the lack of that amorphous \"best player on a title team\" -- becoming (one day) one of those greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts contenders? What Green remains a low-percentage shooter who doesn't bring enough outside of points? What if the whole thing fizzles?\nRight now, Green probably represents their best chance at that superstar -- the apex ball handler. He has internal competition. Thompson has star potential. Smith surged last season, blew up in summer league, and seems poised for another leap in Year 2 on both ends. Sengun could be an All-Star-level producer on offense as soon as this season -- in part because of his promising two-man game with Green -- though Sengun has to reach a passable level on defense.\nBut Green has tantalizing scoring tools and a willingness, he and his coaches say, to lean into more of a playmaking role and to give more effort on defense. In Year 3, he now has to live the message he delivered to that would-be veteran mentor: play unselfishly, play hard, play defense -- always.\nVanVleet is the new point guard, but the Rockets still want the ball in Green's hands. (The Rockets have banished Kevin Porter Jr. from the team as he faces domestic violence charges. The basketball impact -- way down the list of what matters in the Porter case -- is that Green and the rest of Houston's young core will have more opportunities to handle the ball.)\nVanVleet's ability to work off the ball is one reason Houston's decision-makers, including new head coach Ime Udoka, preferred VanVleet over a free agency reunion with Harden.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.' If we want Jalen and the young guys to take the next steps, we need them to have the ball. As for me saying I don't want James, that was never the case. It was about fit.\"\nIt is on Green to pay off that faith by digging deeper into nonscoring aspects of the game.\n\"This is a huge year for him,\" Rafael Stone, the Rockets general manager, told ESPN. \"It's on him to really put together all the things he's worked on. You see individual games where he's locked in -- whether it's on-ball defense, help-side defense, making the right reads in the pick-and-roll. And then there are other games where he just kind of let go of the rope. He's a bucket. It's about all the little things.\"\nA lot of young lottery picks chase points. For some players and their agents, points are the best vehicle to that first big payday. But Houston's coaches are unanimous that Green can become more well-rounded in a season where winning has suddenly become a priority. And where Green ends up in three, four, five years along an unusually wide possibility of outcomes could make or break this new Houston experiment.\n\"He's growing into a pro,\" said Lucas, who worked closely with Green during his rookie season, tweaking Green's jumper and quickening the release. \"His savvy is coming. He's an absolute delight to work with.\"\nGreen said he's ready.\n\"I can contribute to winning,\" he told ESPN. \"I'm an all-around player.\"\nGREEN'S COMBINATION OF speed, burst, and leaping ability is rare even among players toward the top of the draft. During his 1-on-0 pre-draft workout with the Rockets, Green lost the ball on the way up during a layup drill, reached out in midair to snare it, and dunked with power. \"It was like, 'Holy s---, I haven't seen that one before,'\" Stone recalled. \"His athleticism popped. He has one of the highest ceilings of any player that has been drafted recently, and we are in the business of drafting for upside.\"\nOne executive from another team drafting around Green's range told his front office that Green could lead the league in scoring one day.\n\"I have never coached anyone like him,\" Brad Roznovsky, who coached Green for three years at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno, California, told ESPN. \"And I never will again.\"\nAt age 20 on a rebuilding Rockets team -- facing elite defenders almost every game -- Green averaged 22 points and almost four assists. He knifed his way to six free throws per game. Some high-usage ball handlers never average that many free throws. Green was inefficient, but he is on a clear All-Star trajectory.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nRival executives often project his potential peak as similar to those of Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and some statistical models suggest those as decent comparisons. They are also close to Green's height (6-foot-4), a tick shorter than the big wing ball-handlers who often rule the league.\nBeal and LaVine have made five combined All-Star teams, and that number should jump. Beal made one All-NBA team. Those are objectively good outcomes, even for a much-hyped No. 2 pick with Green's scoring chops.\nBut neither has ever been the No. 1 option on a dangerous postseason team. Beal is now the third option on a contender in the Phoenix Suns. LaVine's Chicago Bulls have flatlined in mediocrity. The Rockets aren't putting any ceiling on Green yet, and they shouldn't.\nStill, there is an enormous gap between where Green is now and All-Star-level efficiency. Green shot 41.6% last season -- 33.8% on 3s, 47.1% on 2s. He converted just 55% at the rim.\nThere is low-hanging fruit to pluck. Green chucks up a lot of low-chance jumpers early in the clock when one pass or dribble would keep the offense chugging toward something better.\nGreen has taken (by a hair) more pull-up 3s than catch-and-shoot treys in his career, per NBA.com. He's capable of hitting those shots, but too many come early in possessions. Some are off-balance, over multiple defenders.\n\"There were just too many possessions where he took poor shots with three guys on him,\" Udoka said.\nAlmost one-third of Green's shots in 2022-23 were midrangers, a ton by the standards of the analytics-heavy Rockets. The team is fine with those looks late in the shot clock. They know elite defenses sometimes snuff everything else. Green hit 42% on long 2s last season, and has a knack for stopping on a dime, rising into the clouds, and generating clean on-balance looks. With more judiciousness, that percentage could climb into the high-40s.\nBut the team would like Green to bag contested pull-up 2s that come with time left to explore.\n\"What's important for Jalen is making sure he takes virtually none of those,\" Stone said. \"If that shot [a long 2] is contested, there has to be a better shot for someone else.\"\nOn some of those plays, the right pass is in front of him:\nWatch Sengun roll free then turn his palms to the sky in exasperation after Green jacks a long 2 with 12 seconds on the shot clock instead of threading the pocket pass.\nWhat's both encouraging and frustrating is that Green has those passes in his bag. When trapped, Green is happy to slip the ball to an open teammate immediately.\nThere are plenty of instances of Green making the basic pocket pass as soon as it opens:\nThen just a minute later -- as in that game against the Bulls -- Green might ignore that identical pocket pass in favor of a wayward drive, or toss it too late:\nGreen attempted shots on about 47% of his pick-and-rolls that resulted in the end of possessions -- 43rd among 174 ball handlers who ran at least 200 such plays, per Second Spectrum. Green dished assists on only 9.8% of those actions -- 163rd among that 174-player sample.\nGreen is determined to find a better pass-or-shoot balance.\n\"It's simple reads,\" Green said. \"The pocket pass to Alpie [Sengun], or if the low man helps over, hitting that shooter in the corner.\"\nGREEN SPENT MUCH of the summer in Los Angeles, training with a personal coach -- Adam Harrington, a former assistant for both the Thunder and the Nets -- and participating in 5-on-5 runs with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and other NBA stars. Udoka watched a lot of those pickup games, including one in which Green and Smith were on the same team -- facing a squad that included both Durant and Booker.\n\"In my mind, it was Houston against Phoenix,\" Udoka said. He saw progress in Green's passing.\n\"He has the ability to make the right play,\" Udoka continued. \"You don't always see it on a young team where it's your turn, my turn, and guys are taking poor shots at times. But when the level of talent is raised around him, he makes the right reads. Now there are no excuses. I've seen you do it.\"\nObserving those pickup games, Udoka would sometimes shout for Green to set a flare screen or cut to the rim. Green has flashed some instincts to cut back door when Sengun -- a clever passer -- has the ball at the elbow. Those plays hint at a decent feel -- something that should translate to passing.\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBut they were mere flashes. Houston's offense last season was stagnant. Porter and Green pounded the air out of the ball. On some possessions, they had to wait several seconds before a Houston big man realized he should run up to set a screen. There was no structure, no pace. Spacing was cluttered.\n\"There was a lot of standing around,\" Udoka said.\nLike a lot of young guards, Green sometimes dribbled around the arc without purpose -- bobbing and weaving in the general area of picks without going anywhere. He sometimes rushed through moves, zooming forward before really executing them -- before giving defenders a chance to take the bait.\nVanVleet should loosen spacing and allow Green to attack more off the catch -- with the floor in motion. \"We want to use him more off the ball,\" Udoka said of Green. \"We want him coming off screens and slashing. I don't know if it's natural for him, but you've seen glimpses.\"\nSpacing remains a challenge. Defenses will ignore both Brooks and Eason on the perimeter until they prove themselves as shooters; against certain Houston lineups, defenses had centers guard Eason and hang near the paint. (Eason, by the way, has a chance to be a really good two-way player. He seems to have magnets in his hands, sucking up steals and rebounds that appear out of reach. The Rockets are optimistic he can do more with the ball on offense.) With Sengun and Landale, it might be hard for Udoka to get to lineups in which Smith plays small-ball center.\nGreen oozes ballhandling craft that he is just starting to harness. He can lull defenders to sleep with languid hesitation dribbles toward picks, and then dust them by darting away from those screens. He works nasty in-and-out dribbles with either hand:\nGreen is slim, but at 6-foot-4 with his speed and leaping ability, he could develop a Westbrook-esque style of turbocharged drives through smaller point guard defenders:\nGreen can get to the rim almost at will. His approach and judgment once there has been addled. Green has a habit of flying at rim protectors without a plan and throwing up wild, flailing hope shots.\n\"You have to know where your dump-offs are,\" Udoka said. \"Jalen is used to being able to finish over anyone, but if you get separation and Joel Embiid is sitting in the paint, you can take the midranger instead of attacking him.\"\nIN OFFSEASON WORKOUTS, Harrington slowed everything down and had Green walk through the final two or three steps of every typical action over and over: planting to catch the ball running off a pick; rising for a contested layup; leaping for a pull-up 3; loading off one foot to take a Ray Allen-style leaning jumper.\n\"It was about balance,\" Green said. Harrington wanted Green to feel what each foot should be doing -- to download the body mechanics so that he is comfortable, strong, and poised in every situation.\nThat could lead to more plays where it all comes together:\nThere are not many 20-year-olds who can work all those skills -- all those changes of direction and cadence -- into one pick-and-roll. Green slithers to his right around that Sengun screen then slows down to pin his defender on his hip -- waiting for Sengun to find space. Green veers left, then back right -- finally getting Xavier Tillman to commit and unlocking that hook pass.\nGreen spent a lot of time in L.A. around Durant, watching him work and listening to Durant's advice. Durant told Green that every practice and drill should mimic game intensity.\n\"That's what stuck with me -- to really make everything game-like,\" Green said.\nThe harder work comes on defense. Green has been a pretty glaring minus on that end. Bigger opponents have bullied him, and Green has gotten lost now and then in rotation.\nBut Green can become at least an average defender. He has good length, and he seems to care. His lean frame has its advantages. Harrington developed a mantra for him: Avoid every screen.\n\"We've argued a lot,\" Lucas said about Green when the subject turned to defense. \"Jalen can guard when he wants to. He just hasn't been required to yet.\"\n(Lucas loves needling Green to get under his skin and motivate him. He sometimes asks Green where he was selected in the draft. When Green replies that he was the second pick, Lucas -- the top pick in 1976 -- boasts that he might have already been at the after party or even asleep by the time the second pick rolled around in his draft. \"He gets so mad,\" Lucas said, laughing. When Lucas finds out Green admires an opposing player -- De'Aaron Fox and Anthony Edwards, as examples -- he tells Green that if he is such a fan, Lucas can walk to the opponent locker room and ask for a pair of signed shoes.)Top stories of the week from Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nDefense is not optional under Udoka. \"Defense is more of a mentality,\" the coach said. \"He will be challenged a lot more.\"\nUdoka spares no one in film sessions. \"You'll get called out if you are the weak link,\" Udoka said. \"I'll call him out in front of the whole team. I'm equal opportunity in that.\"\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the mental and physical burden of being a true NBA superstar. Entire defenses are designed to stop you. They change schemes several times within quarters, trying to get in your head. Every possession involves a half-dozen small decisions, all made under pressure. You have to at least execute on defense. And you have to do it 82 times -- and then 10 or 15 or 20 more times in the postseason, when the talent is better, the coaching is more targeted, and everything is done with more urgency.\nLucas is confident. \"In another year, he will really be a professional,\" Lucas said of Green. \"Next season [2024-25], he is going to take off like Ja Morant and Devin Booker.\"\nEven optimists know how much distance lies between where Green is now and where those guys -- and Beal, even LaVine -- have reached. Perhaps it's best to approach this season with smaller goals.\n\"I want to be better for my teammates,\" Green said. \"I'm always going to be able to score. Now, it's more about contributing to my team in other ways.\""}
{"title": "VAR doesn't work without enough cameras and angles -- just ask the NWSL", "date": "2023-10-05 14:48:00", "text": "On the same day that the Premier League had what became a defining blunder for VAR in a high-profile match, the National Women's Soccer League was having just another weekend in its bumpy first season using video replays.\nAmong the calls in question were a penalty that was unconvincingly reversed after review in Chicago and, the next day, an equalizing goal in Seattle that OL Reign coach Laura Harvey insisted afterward was offside. The problem with both decisions was not entirely human error, but the lack of technology available with which the hard-working (and underpaid) humans could make the right decision.\nBoth decisions had major implications on the tightest NWSL playoff race in history. A probable 1-0 Reign win was turned into a 1-1 draw. Racing Louisville could've pulled level, but instead the Chicago Red Stars won, 1-0. VAR, or video-assisted refereeing, was introduced to ensure such calls are right, but it may have done the opposite.\nNone of this drama is new for the NWSL, where defining offside calls are made weekly without truly definitive angles. In Seattle on Sunday, Kerolin's equalizer for the North Carolina Courage stood after a five-plus minute review by referee Elton Garcia -- the official had to try to analyze an offside line from a horrendous angle that was anything but in line with the last defender.\nUnlike in that crucial moment of Saturday's Liverpool-Tottenham game, NWSL referees are not armed with two-dimensional lines to draw across a replay. They do not have the benefit of semi-automated offside, which was used at the 2023 World Cup. They also do not have goal-line technology, nor any cameras on the end lines to provide a definitive angle on would-be goals (which, you guessed it, has been an issue in the NWSL this season).\nInstead, they are at the mercy of the camera angles that they have, which often are not enough to truly make a definitive call on where the offside line is. By the letter of the law -- that a decision must include a \"clear and obvious error\" to be reversed -- NWSL referees are often handcuffed to the call made on the field for lack of sufficient video evidence. Except when they are not.\nOn Saturday in Chicago, with Racing Louisville trailing the Red Stars in the second half, Louisville midfielder Savannah DeMelo was taken down in the box by Chicago midfielder Julia Bianchi. Referee Sergii Demianchuk pointed to the spot for a penalty kick, which looked obvious in real time. The next four minutes were spent in consultation with the VAR, Luis Guardia, and included an extended look at the makeshift monitor setup on a rolling media cart at midfield in SeatGeek Stadium.\n\"This is one of the most important VAR decisions of the entire season,\" commentator Mike Watts said on the broadcast during the stoppage. As Demianchuk emerged from the monitor to deliver the verdict, Watts added: \"Here is a season-changing decision.\"\nDemianchuk jogged back to the penalty area, made the universal \"TV\" sign for VAR review, and motioned for a drop ball. No penalty.\nThe decision was shocking, not so much in that it was an egregious error but because there appeared to be no evidence to support the determination of a clear and obvious error. Bianchi most certainly makes contact with DeMelo in the box. Exactly how much and how forcefully -- or whether she mostly gets the ball -- could only be determined by a reverse angle that did not exist. (Viewers at home are privy to the same replays that appear on the monitor for the referee's review.)\nIf the call on the field was a penalty, it should have stood based on the evidence available.\nAsked by a pool reporter after the game why the call was overturned, and what the clear and obvious error was, Demianchuk's written response was: \"The defender played the ball prior to making contact with the opponent.\"\nThis is not about one referee or one incident, to be clear. VAR's rollout in the NWSL has been hit-and-miss since the opening weekend when Angel City FC was twice on the wrong end of harsh decisions that changed the entire complexion of a home match against NJ/NY Gotham FC.\nEarlier in September during a video review of a goal, referee Alyssa Nichols asked whether a player interfered with an opponent and the assistant VAR said, \"We would need a different angle.\" No other angle was shown to Nichols and Angel City was awarded a goal. Professional Referee Organization later said the goal should not have counted because the player did interfere with an opponent.\nVAR is both a solution and another layer of complication -- that is not unique to the NWSL. What is unique to the NWSL is that VAR has arrived without ample technological support.\nAll NWSL games in 2023 use HD cameras and fiber transmission, according to a league spokesperson. The rare games aired on CBS, including Friday's farewell to Megan Rapinoe and the NWSL Championship scheduled for Nov. 11, utilize 14 cameras. Games that air on CBS Sports Network and that are streamed on Paramount+ have only six cameras, two more than they did for most of last season.\nThe slight numerical increase and improvement to broadcast-quality cameras happened in August 2022 in response to increasing problems with match streams. It was a product fix that also ostensibly helped with the implementation of VAR. All those upgrades likely cost seven figures.\nPerhaps we've entered the era of champagne problems for the NWSL, which is part of becoming big-time as the league wants to (and should) be. Thus far, \"more\" is still not enough. Premier League games, to use the most extreme example, are captured by at least 30 cameras. MLS had a previous minimum of eight cameras per broadcast.\nIn that light, some of the issues with VAR in NWSL -- emphasis on \"some,\" because there are still plenty of improvements to be made in the officiating overall -- can be viewed through the lens of the league's inadequate media rights deal.\nLynn Williams joins \"Futbol Americas\" to talk about why the USWNT failed at the FIFA Women's World Cup.\nCBS reportedly paid $4.5 million for a three-year contract that expires in the coming months. (It was extended by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic canceling the 2020 regular season.) The NWSL -- as in, the owner/operators of each franchise collectively, along with whatever sponsorship money comes in from league headquarters -- foots the bill to produce games.\nLast month, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said she hopes to be able to announce the future of the league's media rights before the NWSL Championship. The league has been in search of a big payday for its next rights deal, but it is seeking that in an unpredictable market filled with media layoffs -- all while new, unproven players in the space unpredictably splash cash on certain properties.\nLeague sources say that a means to an end could involve multiple rights holders to maximize the return from each -- as in, go find the NWSL on multiple channels. Solutions could be confirmed in the coming weeks. Whatever those are, they matter for more reasons than just where fans can find games, and how good the broadcast is.\nVAR has been a good step toward accountability in a league that long lacked it in so many departments. It will require time and continued training to improve the process. It will also require the league to double down on investment in technology to support it."}
{"title": "'Bro, it's your defense': Alabama lost a superstar and somehow got better, thanks to Dallas Turner", "date": "2023-10-05 15:32:17", "text": "On SEC This Morning, host Peter Burns claims he can make Dallas Turner rage quit a game of Madden while they chat about his hobbies off the football field. (3:41)\nAS JALEN MILROE gets more comfortable at quarterback, as the offensive line gets its act together, as penalties and turnovers continue to mount and an offensive identity only now begins to come into focus, one thing has kept the Alabama dynasty on life support and within earshot of the playoff conversation: its defense.\nThrough five games -- admittedly a smallish sample size but not insignificant, either -- the Crimson Tide have given up 4.42 yards per play against FBS opponents, which ranks ninth nationally. Turnovers and pressures are up from last season. Opposing quarterbacks' ratings are down.\nIt has been a while since an Alabama defense has looked this good, on pace to allow fewer than 300 yards per game for the first time since 2017. Against Ole Miss two weeks ago, it held the Rebels to 10 points, their fewest in an SEC game under coach Lane Kiffin and well short of their previous average of 52.7 points per game. And lest that be labeled a fluke, Ole Miss hung 55 on LSU its next time out.\nLast weekend, Alabama kept Mississippi State quarterback Will Rogers, the SEC's No. 2 all-time leading passer, in check to the tune of 107 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. And lest that be labeled a fluke as well, Rogers was coming off 487 yards passing against South Carolina.\nDoes this all mean the return of vintage Nick Saban defenses? It's probably too soon to tell. We'll learn more Saturday when the Tide travel to Texas A&M (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS) for the first time since they gave up 41 points in a loss there two years ago. But while we wait, it may be time to ask an important question: How, after losing arguably the best defensive player in college football in Will Anderson, did the defense get better?\nCredit cornerbacks Malachi Moore and Terrion Arnold for stepping up. The same goes for linebackers Deontae Lawson and Chris Braswell. But the place to start is the man who on paper was tasked with replacing Anderson.\nDallas Turner spent the past two seasons quietly making a name for himself as one of the best young players in the country -- a blend of speed, agility and strength that's perfectly suited for the modern edge rusher. Playing opposite Anderson at outside linebacker, the South Florida native flourished in a role that was part sidekick, part understudy. His 12.5 sacks during that time were solid, ranking in the top 50 nationally, but they were dwarfed by Anderson and his FBS-best 27.5 sacks.\nWhen Anderson left for the NFL draft in January, he pulled Turner aside and told him pointedly, \"Bro, it's your defense.\"\nAnderson, drafted No. 3 overall, said he told Saban the same thing, stressing that the outside linebackers set the tone.\n\"[Turner] can be one of the best to come through Alabama,\" Anderson told ESPN. \"He would always say, 'Bro, I wanna do what you do.' And I always told him, 'Do better than what I did.' And I honestly believe he can do that, 100 percent.\"\nThat includes surpassing Anderson's 17.5 sacks and 34 tackles for loss as a sophomore, he said.\n\"I truly believe that,\" Anderson said. \"I know the type of hard work he puts in. I know his mentality. I know the grit and the love that he has for the game, that he can go out there and do all those things.\"\nAfter posting 3.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and a forced fumble against Ole Miss, Turner wore a T-shirt with a likeness of himself flexing in uniform. Soft-spoken, he let his attire do the work.\nWritten in all-caps above the cartoon image were the words, \"NO LIMIT.\"\nIt's what Turner feels about Alabama this season -- \"There's no limit to how good the defense can be,\" he said -- and how coaches feel about his potential as one of the most gifted edge rushers in college football.\nTURNER'S FOOTBALL ASCENSION was first written in code on a PlayStation outside of Seoul, South Korea. It was 2001, and Delon Turner was nearing the end of his professional career for Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus of the Korean Basketball League when he and a roommate passed the time during an off day by playing Madden.\nThey competed in full seasons against one another with simple rules. They each allowed the other to create one player and give that player an unlimited rating, making that player the best on the field.\nDelon's roommate created a running back and named him after his son, Jaylen. And because Delon couldn't tackle the 99-rated Jaylen with anyone on the roster, he made a 99-rated defensive end as a countermeasure.\nHe didn't have a son of his own yet, so he picked a name at random: Dallas.\nFast-forward two years and a return to the U.S., the name stuck. But the unique story of Dallas' birth didn't end there.\n\"As [my wife] was giving labor,\" Delon recalled, \"I was watching the Pro Bowl.\"\nThe stars aligned perfectly as Delon handed down not only his athletic ability but his work ethic as a professional athlete. Dallas seemed to understand the big picture at a young age, like when he gave up a promising basketball career, which had included a coveted Team USA invite, to focus on football. He went to American Heritage High School to get coached by former Miami Dolphin Pat Surtain. And sensing he needed a change of scenery before college, he transferred to St. Thomas Aquinas, where he would receive coaching from another former Dolphin, Jason Taylor, a first-ballot Hall of Famer and one of the best defensive ends to ever play the game.\n\"God blessed Dallas with a lot of talent and length and height and size,\" Taylor said. \"So you combine that with the skills learned on the basketball court -- your lateral movement, your foot quickness, your hand-eye coordination, instantaneously going from offense to defense and having to backpedal and turn and open your hips and roll and run and all the things -- and then you transplant that into a kid that has some dog in them and is highly, highly competitive and physical and hungry, it's a nasty combination.\"\nBut the thing Taylor said he appreciated most about Dallas was how open he was to coaching. Already a high-profile recruit once he got to St. Thomas Aquinas, Taylor said Dallas \"wanted to be pushed.\" So much so that Delon hired pass-rush specialist Javon Gopie to work with Dallas starting his sophomore season of high school. Gopie said Dallas told him right off the bat, \"These are the things I'm great at, but I want to be more intentional and become a smarter pass-rusher.\"\nWhen Nick Saban came calling, Taylor didn't sugarcoat what an Alabama offer meant. Taylor, who was coached by Saban for two years in the NFL and credits him with taking his career from good to great, told Dallas, \"You have to be willing to go there and work and grind and be coached hard.\"\n\"That place isn't for everybody,\" Taylor said, \"and he didn't shy away from it.\"\nDallas considered Georgia, Florida, Michigan and Oklahoma. But he said, \"My family trusted Nick Saban and the coaching staff over there to help me get where I need to go.\"\nDelon said there was one more factor that helped seal the deal.\nDelon recalled the family visiting campus for a game against No. 3 Georgia when a newcomer named Will Anderson stood out, racking up four tackles and a quarterback hurry. Anderson would go on to register seven sacks in his final six games as a true freshman.\nDallas told Delon after the game, \"If that guy can do it, I can do it.\"\nAnd then when it came to other colleges, \"everybody else was a distant second,\" Delon said.\nTURNER WAS QUIET when he got to Alabama. Naturally reserved, he watched Anderson and veterans like Chris Allen work and kept his distance at first.\nAnderson was having none of that, though, welcoming him to the team with some good-natured ribbing about his weight.\n\"Dallas,\" Anderson chided him, \"you're a little big to play outside linebacker.\"\nTruth be told, Turner was in fine shape. He just needed time to find his place on the defense, starting out on the bench until Drew Sanders suffered a season-ending injury five games into the 2021 season.\nBy that time, Anderson had already taken Turner under his wing, teaching him patience.\n\"From the get-go, it was an easy relationship to build,\" Anderson said. \"He came in with his head on right, he was willing to listen to the older guys in the room, and he just wanted to be great. And when you have guys like that, who share the mentality that I have, we just gravitate towards each other.\"\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nBy a shared mentality, Anderson meant, \"Whatever it takes to be great.\"\nLike Anderson, Turner came on late as a freshman, registering all 5.5 of his sacks in his final seven games.\nThe two became close -- \"That's my best friend, my little bro,\" Anderson said -- spending countless hours in the film room studying one another.\n\"It was never a competition between me and Will,\" Turner said. \"Because I always knew Will was good. I knew when I came in that people were going to be better than me. So I just tried to look at it as just be a sponge, just soak up everything.\"\nAnderson said Turner taught him a few things, too, like what techniques to use against certain offensive tackles.\nWhereas Anderson overwhelmed opponents with his strength and speed, Turner was a tactician. Their go-to moves even coincided with their nicknames: Anderson went by \"Speed-to-power Will\" while Turner went by \"Stab Club Dal.\"\nOffensive lineman JC Latham said he constantly has to be on the lookout for Turner's lethal \"ghost\" move, where he deploys a stutter step and curls under contact to get to the quarterback.\n\"Dallas has a pass-rush repertoire that allows him to dive deep into many different things,\" Latham said. \"So even though both [Turner and Anderson] are extremely talented, extremely great, they have two different types of styles to play.\"\nAnderson got all the publicity. He even picked up the catchy nickname, \"The Terminator,\" from then-offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian.\nTurner flew below the radar. \"It's just Dallas for now,\" he said.\nREPLACE WILL ANDERSON?\nAs in, replace an All-American and one of the best defensive players to ever come through Alabama?\nNo, Saban wasn't buying that premise at all.\n\"You don't kind of look at it like somebody's replacing somebody,\" he said. \"You look at it like, what do you need to continue to help develop that guy to play well.\"\nGopie has seen the long arc of Turner's development -- the five-star prospect with his pick of schools, the standout freshman at Alabama and the perceived sophomore dip last season, going from 8.5 sacks in 2021 to four sacks in 2022. Gopie said the numbers are a bit misleading because Turner was still affecting the quarterback as a sophomore. And the analytics back that up, showing a pressure rate of 12.2% vs. 13.8% the year before. Turner's third-down pressure rate actually improved 4.9 percentage points.\nBut Gopie recognized the pressure entering Turner's junior season. With Anderson no longer rushing off the opposite edge, it was fair to wonder how effective Turner would be.\n\"Last year when Will was projected a top-five pick, I think Dallas knew at that moment, 'OK, my time is coming and it's time for me to be able to lead the group,'\" Gopie said. \"He's no longer the young guy anymore.\"\nGopie said it has been encouraging to see Turner lean on his family and the pass-rush community he has been a part of during the offseason in South Florida, working with pros like Greg Russo, Shaq Lawson and Bradley Chubb.\n\"I think leaning on everybody that he has in his corner has really really empowered him to embrace this position,\" Gopie said. \"And he's excited for it.\"\nAt SEC media days this summer, Turner acknowledged what was at stake in what could be his final season in college. ESPN rates him a consensus top-10 pick in next year's NFL draft.\nA reporter reminded him that no Alabama player during the Saban era has gone three years without winning a national championship. But before the reporter could finish his sentence, Turner pointed to his ring finger, where a piece of jewelry should be.\nRemembering the losses the past two seasons and hearing all the criticism of the defense has been like adding fuel to their collective fire, Turner said.\nWhen Anderson said he \"cried [his] eyes out\" after Alabama suffered its second loss of the 2022 season at LSU, Turner said he was right there with him.\n\"But I feel like [Anderson] has taught me some things leadership wise to how to lead the team in the right direction,\" he said. \"But I feel like now we have all the right pieces now that we need all the right guys in the locker room, all the leaders that we need, too, to get to where we need to go.\"\nTurner promised he'd take \"full ownership.\"\nThat accountability showed after a Week 2 loss to Texas. Turner took it personally, calling it \"sickening\" that they gave up 34 points at home. The next day, the veterans on the team called a players-only meeting to clear the air. Turner called it a \"come-together moment\" in which they \"set the tone of what it's going to be on Saturdays.\"\nIn the three games since, Turner has been a man on fire, with 17 tackles, two forced fumbles and 5.5 sacks, which is second most among Power 5 players this season.\nDon't look now, but Turner's rate of sacks per game (1.1) and tackles for loss (1.5) are both higher than Anderson's last season.\nSo how good can he be?\nTaylor said there's no limit.\n\"As good as he wants,\" he said. \"He's an ultra-talented kid. Got a lot of bend, really good twitch, long, powerful. I mean, he's got everything. The length, the hand usage, plays a great pad level. He's as competitive as any kid I've been around. He's very gifted. Now the rest is up to him.\""}

Zach Edey and other elite big men decided against turning pro and returned for another year. Some of the top stars changed locations (see: Hunter Dickinson to Kansas). Coaches, too. Ed Cooley is at Georgetown now. Micah Shrewsberry is at Notre Dame.\nAll of that and we haven't even discussed the nearly 2,000 players who entered the transfer portal.\nThe change and volatility have made it even more difficult to project who will win conference player of the year honors in each of the 32 Division I men's leagues. But we'll give it a shot.\nSome of the candidates were easy to pick. (The Big South could probably give Drew Pember his second consecutive player of the year honor today if it wanted to.) Others were more difficult to identify.\nBut we're excited to see how it all plays out and how accurate we are at the end of the season.\nHere are our preseason predictions for player of the year in each league -- and the top competition they'll have to beat.\nJump to each conference:\nAmerican | America East |  ACC |  ASUN | A-10| Big 12 |  Big East |  Big Sky |  Big South |  Big Ten |  Big West |  CAA |  C-USA |  Horizon | Ivy | MAAC |  MAC |  MEAC |  MVC |  MW |  NEC |  OVC |  Pac-12 |  Patriot  |  SEC |  SoCon |  Southland |  SWAC |  Summit  |  Sun Belt |  WCC |  WAC\n \nAlijah Martin | 6-2 | G | Florida Atlantic Owls\nAfter averaging 15.2 PPG during FAU's run to the Final Four last season, Martin is back to lead the Owls in their first season in the AAC.\nTop competition: Jordan Brown, Memphis Tigers (19.3 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 1.2 BPG at Louisiana)\n \nClarence O. Daniels II | 6-foot-6 | F | New Hampshire Wildcats\nAlthough he had multiple suitors after entering the transfer portal this summer, Daniels (15.3 PPG, 10.7 RPG) decided to return to New Hampshire. The 2022-23 America East all-conference first-teamer will play under new coach Nathan Davis this season.\nTop competition: Earl Timberlake, Bryant Bulldogs (13.8 PPG, 8.4 RPG)\n \nArmando Bacot | 6-11 | F | North Carolina Tar Heels\nAlthough the Heels failed to make the NCAA tournament despite entering the 2022-23 season as the No. 1 team in America, Bacot (15.9 PPG, 10.4 RPG) undeniably is one of the top returning players in the country.\nTop competition: Kyle Filipowski, Duke Blue Devils (15.1 PPG, 9.0 RPG)\n \nDemarcus Sharp | 6-3 | G | Austin Peay Governors\nLast season's Southland Player of the Year (19.5 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 5.0 APG at Northwestern State now bring his talents to Austin Peay, where he'll try to reenergize a program that finished 9-22 in 2022-23.\nTop competition: Devontae Blanton, Eastern Kentucky Colonels (16.9 PPG, 37% from the 3-point line)\n \nDaRon Holmes II | 6-10 | F | Dayton Flyers\nA year after securing all-Atlantic 10 first-team honors, Holmes (18.4 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 1.9 BPG) hopes to lead Dayton to its first NCAA tournament since 2017.\nTop competition: James Bishop IV, George Washington Revolutionaries (21.6 PPG, 5.2 APG)\n \nTyler Kolek | 6-3 | G | Marquette Golden Eagles\nA thumb injury hindered the reigning Big East player of the year in the 2023 NCAA tournament, but Kolek (12.9 PPG, 7.5 APG, 40% from 3) is back to help Marquette chase its first Final Four appearance since 2003.\nTop competition: Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton Bluejays (15.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.1 BPG)\n \nDillon Jones | 6-6 | G | Weber State Wildcats\nThe all-Big Sky first-teamer last season (16.7 PPG, 10.9 RPG) tested the NBA draft waters and even had a strong showing at the G League Elite Camp and NBA draft combine -- but ultimately chose to return to Weber State, where he aims to lead the program to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2016.\nTop competition: Aanen Moody, Montana Grizzlies (16.1 PPG, 41% from beyond the arc)\n \nDrew Pember | 6-11 | C | UNC Asheville Bulldogs\nThe reigning Big South Player of the Year (21.0 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 38% from 3) returns to anchor a team that hopes to hit the trifecta again with another league championship, conference tournament title and NCAA tournament appearance.\nTop competition: DaQuan Smith, Radford Highlanders (13.9 PPG, 40% from 3)\n \nHunter Dickinson | 7-1 | C | Kansas Jayhawks\nKansas will follow Dickinson (18.5 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.8 BPG), an all-Big Ten second-teamer in 2022-23 and the most coveted prospect in the transfer portal this offseason, as it attempts to win its second national championship in three seasons.\nTop competition: Max Abmas, Texas Longhorns (21.9 PPG, 37% from beyond the arc at Oral Roberts)\n \nZach Edey | 7-4 | C | Purdue Boilermakers\nWith another stellar performance, Edey (22.3 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 2.1 BPG) could become the first player to win the Wooden Award in consecutive years since Ralph Sampson pulled off the feat 40 years ago. He could also help erase the memory of that first-round loss to Fairleigh Dickinson with a deep run in the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Terrence Shannon Jr., Illinois Fighting Illini (17.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG)\n \nAjay Mitchell | 6-4 | G | UC Santa Barbara Gauchos\nMitchell (16.3 PPG, 5.1 APG), who led the Gauchos to a conference tournament crown and NCAA tournament appearance last season, will chase his second consecutive Big West Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Elijah Pepper, UC Davis Aggies (22.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG)\n \nTyler Thomas | 6-3 | G | Hofstra Pride\nThe all-CAA second-teamer last season (16.5 PPG, 41% from 3) has one goal: to carry Hofstra to its first NCAA tournament appearance (the school won the CAA title in 2020 and would have played had the NCAA tournament not been canceled due to COVID-19) since 2001.\nTop competition: Charles Thompson, Towson Tigers (12.2 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 1.7 BPG)\n \nDontaie Allen | 6-6 | G | Western Kentucky Hilltoppers\nIn February and March, the former Kentucky guard began to hit his stride, seeing four games with 17 points or more. That momentum could propel Allen (9.3 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line) to new heights under new head coach Steve Lutz.\nTop competition: Kyle Rode, Liberty Flames (10.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line)\n \nBJ Freeman | 6-6 | G | Milwaukee Panthers\nFreeman showed his promise with a 43-point performance in a win over Stetson in last season's CBI. The guard, who averaged 18.22 PPG, could now help lead a program that's on an upward trajectory (22-12, 14-6 league) to its first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade.\nTop competition: Marques Warrick, Northern Kentucky Norse (18.8 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMatt Knowling | 6-5 | F | Yale Bulldogs\nThe all-Ivy League first-teamer (13.6 PPG) headlines a squad of key returners who were instrumental in winning the regular-season title. They missed out on the 2023 NCAA tournament following a nine-point loss to rival Princeton in the conference tournament championship.\nTop competition: Matt Allocco, Princeton Tigers (10.7 PPG, 38.3% from beyond the arc)\n \nMervin James | 6-7 | F | Rider Broncs\nThe all-MAAC second-teamer led Rider to a 13-7 record last season (second place in the league). Couple that with the departure of Rick Pitino and the exodus of transfers out of Iona, and the door is open for James and the Broncs to win top MAAC honors.\nTop competition: Dakota Leffew, Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers (13.1 PPG, 38% from beyond the arc)\n \nEnrique Freeman | 6-7 | C | Akron Zips\nAn all-MAC first-teamer last season, Freeman (16.8 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 1.2 BPG) anchors an Akron squad that could conquer the league and win the regular-season crown for the first time since 2020.\nTop competition: Jaylin Hunter, Ohio Bobcats (13.2 PPG, 41% from 3)\n \nShy Odom | 6-6 | F | Howard Bison\nThe buzz around Odom's MEAC Player of the Year potential in 2023-24 increased when he led notched 15 points (5-for-9) and eight rebounds in the 16-seed's 96-68 loss to 1-seed Kansas in the first round of last year's NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Martaz Robinson, Delaware State Hornets (11.8 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 1.5 SPG)\n \nTucker DeVries | 6-7 | F | Drake Bulldogs\nIt would be difficult to topple the reigning MVC player of the year, who returns after averaging 18.6 PPG (37% from the 3-point line) and leading his team to the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Bowen Born, Northern Iowa Panthers (17.9 PPG, 37% from 3)\n \nJamal Mashburn Jr. | 6-2 | G | New Mexico Lobos\nThe son of former NBA and Kentucky star Jamal Mashburn Sr. is a potent scorer (19.1 PPG, 38% from 3) and hopes to position his team to compete for a Mountain West championship.\nTop competition: Tyson Degenhart, Boise State Broncos (14.1 PPG)\n \nNico Galette | 6-6 | F | Sacred Heart Pioneers\nThe all-NEC first-teamer (15.4 PPG, 6.7 RPG) scored in double figures 30 times and recorded four double-doubles last seasons, making him one of the top returning mid-major stars in the country.\nTop competition: Ansley Almonor, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (13.6 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMark Freeman | 5-10 | G | Morehead State Eagles\nHead coach Preston Spradlin told ESPN.com this summer that Freeman (15.0 PPG, 3.7 APG) has continued to improve from last season.

But he was already a contender before they left, thanks to a sizzling February and March (20.4 PPG over the last nine games of the 2022-23 season).\nTop competition: Parker Bjorklund, St. Thomas-Minnesota Tommies (22.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG)\n \nAustin Crowley | 6-5 | G | Southern Miss Golden Eagles\nThe all-Sun Belt first-teamer returns to avenge a 4-for-13 performance in a first-round Sun Belt Conference tournament loss to South Alabama -- the same loss that sent the league's regular-season champs home much earlier than anticipated.\nTop competition: Donovan Gregory, Appalachian State Mountaineers (12.5 PPG, 4.3 APG)\n \nPJ Henry | 5-10 | G | Texas Southern Tigers\nFor the last three years, Texas Southern has won the SWAC tournament, and therefore the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The return of Henry (12.4 PPG) could lead to a fourth consecutive berth for coach Johnny Jones' squad.\nTop competition: Jeremiah Kendall, Alcorn State Braves (11.1 PPG, 6.7 RPG)\n \nRayshon Harrison | 6-4 | G | Grand Canyon Lopes\nHe was an all-WAC first-teamer last season after averaging 17.8 PPG and 4.0 RPG, and leading his team to the NCAA tournament. With his return to college basketball, Harrison hopes to prove his 20-point effort in the Lopes' 82-70 loss to Gonzaga in the first round wasn't a fluke.\nTop competition: Cameron Tyson, Seattle U Redhawks (18.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG)\n \nAidan Mahaney | 6-3 | G | Saint Mary's Gaels\nWith Drew Timme gone, Mahaney (13.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line) could emerge as the face of West Coast Conference basketball -- particularly if he can lead the Gaels to another conference title (they shared the crown with Gonzaga last season) and an NCAA tournament berth.\nTop competition: Ryan Nembhard, Gonzaga Bulldogs (12.1 PPG, 4.8 APG at Creighton)"}
{"title": "All the biggest storylines of the 2023-24 offseason", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:23", "text": "Has it really only been six months?\nThe buzzer sounded on UConn's win over San Diego State in the men's college basketball national championship game exactly six months ago -- but the entire landscape of the sport has changed in that time. Rick Pitino is back in the big time; Bob Huggins is no longer coaching. Arizona will be headed to the Big 12; the Pac-12 is essentially no more. More than 1,800 players entered the transfer portal; another couple hundred turned pro.\nSimply put, there's been an incredible amount of change.\nBut before we turn the page and fully look ahead to the 2023-24 season, which tips off Nov. 6, let's take stock of exactly what happened in the past six months.\nIf the last thing you remember about college hoops is confetti falling from the NRG Stadium rafters after the Huskies won their fifth national championship in 25 years, ESPN's men's college basketball experts -- Jeff Borzello, John Gasaway, Joe Lunardi and Myron Medcalf -- are here to help you catch up.\nJump to:\nBiggest headlines | Coach & player movements | Bracketology risers and fallers | High school recruiting spotlights\n \nLeBron James says his son Bronny has begun his rehab process so he can play with USC this season.\nBronny James suffers cardiac incident\nDuring a July team workout at USC, the 5-star recruit and son of LeBron James collapsed after suffering cardiac arrest. James is recovering and attending his classes on campus. But his basketball future -- his father has said he hopes to one day play with Bronny in the NBA -- is unclear, per a recent statement from the university.\nHunter Dickinson picks Kansas\nIn May, the former Michigan star and top recruit in the transfer portal picked the Jayhawks over multiple suitors coveting the big man who averaged 18.5 points and 9.0 rebounds last season. In interviews, Dickinson implied his decision was partly influenced by name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities. His arrival likely elevates Kansas, which returns Dajuan Harris Jr. and K.J. Adams Jr., to the No. 1 spot in every reputable preseason poll.\nZach Edey, Donovan Clingan and Kyle Filipowski return\nThe current state of big men in college basketball is strong with three elite players returning for another season. Edey, the Purdue star who won the Wooden Award last season, is back to help a Purdue squad that suffered a historic upset against 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson in the 2023 NCAA tournament. Clingan, the 7-footer who averaged 1.8 blocks in just 13.1 minutes per game, will attempt to lead UConn to a second consecutive national title. And Filipowski, who is currently recovering from hip surgery, will try to lead Duke to its second Final Four appearance since 2015.\nControversy surrounds Rick Pitino hiring at St. John's\nIn three years at Iona, Pitino led the Gaels to two league titles and two NCAA tournament appearances. Pitino repeatedly stated he was content at the New Rochelle, New York, school and had no interest in other jobs. But he was eventually wooed by St. John's, which is just 30 minutes from his hometown of Oyster Bay, New York. The Hall of Fame coach has already made a massive impact in the transfer portal, adding Harvard star Chris Ledlum (18.8 PPG) and Penn's Jordan Dingle (23.4 PPG) along with other standouts who should immediately boost the Red Storm in the Big East race. But Mike Anderson, St. John's former head coach, has sued the school in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, claiming the school fired him for cause without justification.\nJahvon Quinerly picks Memphis Tigers\nLast season, the guard was critical to Alabama's NCAA tournament run, but he announced he would transfer to his third school when he committed to Penny Hardaway in July. As a grad transfer, Quinerly is immediately eligible for the squad that last season allowed former SMU transfer Kendric Davis to blossom. Quinerly, who averaged 8.7 PPG in Tuscaloosa last season, joins a nucleus that could include 27-year-old DeAndre Williams -- provided he is granted a waiver to play another season.\nChris \"Mad Dog\" Russo sounds off on the lack of rivalries between the teams heading to the Big Ten and Big 12 in 2024.\nBig 12 becomes superconference, rejects Gonzaga, UConn\nIn August, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark announced that talks with Gonzaga and UConn about joining the league ended after the conference decided to add four Pac-12 squads. While the Zags and Huskies would have strengthened men's basketball in a league that is arguably the nation's best, pound-for-pound, the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Utah and Colorado in 2024-25 also enhance the league. With Houston, BYU, Cincinnati and UCF all joining this season, the Big 12 will boast seven teams that finished 2022-23 within the top 30 on KenPom.\nMikey Williams' basketball career jeopardized by gun incident\nWith millions of followers on social media, the four-star recruit and Memphis commit was well-known even outside of basketball when he was in high school. But Williams' college hoops career is now on hold. Earlier this year, Williams was charged with six felonies after he allegedly fired a weapon at multiple individuals who had come to his San Diego home. He pled not guilty in the initial court hearing, but Memphis released a statement last week saying Williams will not be with the team until there is a resolution in his legal case.\nEd Cooley leaves Providence for Georgetown\nFor more than a decade, Cooley was the face of Providence basketball in his hometown. Under him, the Friars reached the NCAA tournament seven times. But his bond with the late John Thompson contributed to his shocking decision to accept the head coaching job at Georgetown. Providence officials and fans were blindsided by the move, which now gives Georgetown a proven leader as it attempts to rebuild the program following the turbulent Patrick Ewing era. -- Medcalf\n \nThe biggest movement of the summer was actually an exit. Bob Huggins entered the offseason No. 3 all time in career wins as a Division I men's coach, behind only Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim. Now, well, he's still No. 3, but that number for wins (935) will stay where it is until further notice.\nHuggins appeared to resign as West Virginia coach on June 17 after he was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. Then, in early July, he insisted he never formally resigned. Cue the lawyers. But Huggins is out, and Josh Eilert is interim head coach of the Mountaineers.\nNor should we look past a very different and truly historic offseason movement, one 65 years in the making. On June 8, the NCAA announced that all numbers from 0 to 99 will once again be permitted on men's college basketball jerseys. We haven't seen a 6, 7, 8 or 9 on the floor since Bill Russell rocked No. 6 for the San Francisco Dons in the 1950s.\nWho will be the first player to follow in George Mikan's footsteps with a No. 99 in hoops? The new season will literally look different than anything many of us have seen before. -- Gasaway\n \nRick Pitino chats on \"SportsCenter\" about why he decided to become the next coach at St. John's.\nIt's both embarrassing and instructive to look back at where we ranked teams at the start of the offseason versus now, with the tip off of a new season right around the corner. Alas, that is the assignment, and here are the results:\nBIGGEST RISER: St. John's Red Storm (No. 170 to No. 45, projected Last Four In). The Red Storm fired Mike Anderson on March 10 and needed only 10 days to lure Rick Pitino from New Rochelle (and Iona) to Queens. Myron covered the larger St. John's saga above, but suffice to say, Pitino's pursuit of an NCAA tournament bid -- and beyond -- for the Red Storm will be among the major storylines of the 2023-24 campaign.\nOTHER RISERS:\nIllinois Fighting Illini (No. 74 to No. 18, projected 5-seed). Illinois gained ground by essentially standing still, retaining 6-foot-6 senior Terrence Shannon Jr. and 6-10 junior Coleman Hawkins, a pair of standouts who figured to leave the program at the end of last season. Now, the Illini have the experience and production to challenge presumptive Big Ten favorites Purdue and Michigan State.\nMississippi State Bulldogs (No. 78 to No. 29, projected 8-seed). The Bulldogs already overachieved in Year 1 under Chris Jans, reaching the NCAA First Four. The surprising return of 6-2 senior Dashawn Davis, a presumed departure, means the trend line points even further up in Starkville.\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\nNorthwestern Wildcats (No. 76 to No. 32, projected 8-seed)\nOregon Ducks (No. 75 to No. 34, projected 9-seed)\nKansas State Wildcats (No. 70 to No. 41, projected First Four)\nVirginia Cavaliers (No. 72 to No. 43, projected First Four)\nStanford Cardinal (No. 77 to No. 49, projected First Four Out)\nNew Mexico Lobos (No. 95 to No. 50, projected Next Four Out)\nUtah Utes (No. 81 to No. 53)\nSeton Hall Pirates (No. 84 to No. 56)\nLSU Tigers (No. 96 to No. 64)\nNevada Wolf Pack (No. 121 to No. 68)\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nBIGGEST FALLER: Washington State Cougars (from No. 42, projected 11-seed, to No. 76). The Cougars' best players are now in Atlanta (Mouhamed Gueye, NBA Hawks), in Cleveland (Justin Powell, NBA Cavaliers), at Villanova (TJ Bamba, transfer portal) and at USC (DJ Rodman, transfer portal). The Cougars also don't have a conference after this season. Other than that ...\nOTHER FALLERS:\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish (from No. 183 to No. 214). The rebuilding Irish were always going to be a heavy lift for new coach Micah Shrewsberry. The loss of grad transfer Cormac Ryan to North Carolina makes the start of the post-Mike Brey era that much harder.\nMiami Hurricanes (from No. 10, projected 3-seed, to No. 33, projected 9-seed). Folks remain justifiably high on the Hurricanes, but it's hard not to forecast at least a one-season drop after a Final Four finish led by ACC player of the year Isaiah Wong, subsequently picked by the Indiana Pacers in the NBA draft.\nMORE FALLERS:\nUCLA Bruins (from No. 11, projected 3-seed, to No. 25, projected 7-seed)\nProvidence Friars (from No. 32, projected 8-seed, to No. 44, projected Last Four In)\nRutgers Scarlet Knights (from No. 35, projected 89-seed, to No. 47, projected First Four Out)\nOhio State Buckeyes (from No. 36, projected 9-seed, to No. 48, projected First Four Out)\nBoise State Broncos (from No. 38, projected 10-seed, to No. 52, projected Next Four Out)\nMichigan Wolverines (from No. 43, projected First Four, to No. 61)\nVirginia Tech Hokies (from No. 44, projected First Four, to No. 60)\n-- Lunardi\n \nCooper Flagg shows out with three nice dunks before playing in the SLAM Summer Classic.\nRon Holland decommits from Texas, goes pro\nHolland -- now the projected No. 1 pick in the 2024 NBA draft -- was expected to be the cornerstone of Texas' 2023-24 roster. He committed to the Longhorns in November and stayed committed, despite Chris Beard's firing. After weeks of speculation, however, the No. 2-ranked recruit in the 2024 class announced in late April he was reopening his recruitment. One month later, Holland chose to play for the G League Ignite.\nBronny James signs with USC\nJames' cardiac arrest was the biggest story of the summer, but his recruitment was one of the biggest stories of the spring. He became a legitimate five-star prospect and a projected first-round draft pick during his high school senior season then impressed at the postseason all-star games. There was very little concrete information about his recruitment, but USC emerged as the favorite over the final weeks and ultimately beat out Oregon and Ohio State.\nMackenzie Mgbako flips from Duke to Indiana\nOn the same day that Kyle Filipowski announced he was returning to Duke, Mgbako -- a top-10 recruit in the 2024 class -- requested a release from his letter of intent to the Blue Devils. He considered several schools following his decommitment, including Kansas, St. John's and Louisville, but picked Mike Woodson and Indiana, where he should immediately be a go-to scorer.\nCooper Flagg cements himself as the No. 1 recruit -- and reclassifies to 2024\nFlagg was the story of the summer in the recruiting world. Entering July, there was a debate over which player was the best in high school basketball: Flagg, Cameron Boozer or A.J. Dybantsa. A couple of weeks later, there was a clear winner. Flagg averaged 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 6.9 blocks at the prestigious Nike EYBL Peach Jam, including three triple-doubles. He then moved from the 2025 class into the 2024 class, and Flagg is in the process of taking his official visits. He went to UConn in late September, and he will head Duke this month. -- Borzello"}
{"title": "The offseason in five minutes: Everything you need to know", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "The 2022-23 season ended with the most-viewed women's college basketball game on record as the national championship returned to network television for the first time since 1995. Broadcast on ABC and ESPN2, 9.9 million viewers tuned in as LSU beat Iowa 102-85.\nWhat has happened since then? Glad you asked.\nWe head into 2023-24 with LSU ranked No. 1 in ESPN's Way-Too-Early Top 25. For the second straight offseason, coach Kim Mulkey cleaned up in the transfer portal to make the Tigers -- who have Final Four Most Outstanding Player Angel Reese back -- the favorites on the road to Cleveland, where the national semifinals and title game will be played April 5-7 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nDespite big personnel losses, led by WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston, South Carolina -- which spent all last season at No. 1 before losing in the Final Four -- will still be in the hunt. With Paige Bueckers, who missed last season because of an ACL injury, and Azzi Fudd, who was limited to 15 games by knee issues, back and healthy, UConn is another front-runner as the Huskies pursue a 12th national championship.\nBut while some things remain the same ... along comes conference realignment. Stanford seeks one more Pac-12 title before the conference as we know it dissolves. Stanford's next stop, incongruous as this is, is the ACC. UCLA, expected to be Stanford's biggest Pac-12 challenger, is headed to the Big Ten next season. But more on that in a minute.\nIowa senior Caitlin Clark, the NCAA tournament supernova and reigning national player of the year, is back -- maybe for more than this season. Clark's incoming freshman class of 2020-21 is the last that can use the COVID-19 waiver to return for a fifth year, so WNBA teams likely will have to wait until the end of the college season to find out exactly which players -- such as Bueckers, Clark, Reese and Stanford's Cameron Brink -- are in the draft pool and potential lottery picks.\nBut before we tip off the new season on Nov. 6, ESPN's Michael Voepel, Alexa Philippou and Charlie Creme look at what has gone on since LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy, and how it impacts the coming season.\nJump to:\nHeadlines | Key transfers, coaching news, recruits | Bracketology risers and fallers\nOn \"The Paul Finebaum Show,\" Carolyn Peck explains why the talented Gamecocks and a gritty Tennessee will be stiff competition for the reigning national champs.\nLSU gets even better\nThe transfer portal has been kind of like free agency in college, and more than 1,000 players entered the portal this past offseason. LSU bringing in Hailey Van Lith from Louisville and Aneesah Morrow from DePaul gave the Tigers the \"portal championship\" a year after they did the same with Reese from Maryland in summer 2022. More on the other biggest transfers below.\nUConn back to full strength?\nWhile UConn's absurd streak of 14 consecutive Final Four appearances came to an end, the Huskies seem due for better luck after two seasons of multiple injuries.\nBueckers was national player of the year as a freshman and then battled through injuries to get UConn to the NCAA championship game as a sophomore. The Huskies missed her last season, but she seems to have gone through rehab well, is cleared to play and is ready to regain her status as one of the college game's biggest stars.\nSo long, Pac-12\nWe should have seen it coming when UCLA and USC announced in summer 2022 that they were headed to the Big Ten. The Pac-12 was crumbling, with the walls officially tumbling in summer 2023. With four teams headed to the Big Ten, four to the Big 12, two to the ACC and two others with an uncertain future, the Pac-12's swan song in 2023-24 is an ode to how football and television revenue have rendered geographic ties in college almost irrelevant.\nWell-played, Big 12\nIn summer 2010, the Big 12 appeared on the verge of collapse. It survived with 10 teams, and now will be adding Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah next season, putting the league at 16 teams after Texas and Oklahoma depart for the SEC. From a women's hoops perspective, the league will miss the Longhorns and Sooners, but the Utes (No. 5 in ESPN rankings) and Buffaloes (No. 22) are having program resurgences. And Arizona is just a few years removed from its appearance in the 2021 NCAA final.\nKa-ching!\nThe college world has changed with Name, Image and Likeness opportunities, especially for the bigger stars in women's sports. Players such as Reese and Clark have spent time since the national championship game shooting television commercials and being paid for appearing at events. -- Voepel\nCheck out highlights from No. 1 recruit Lauren Betts as she announces her intention to transfer from Stanford.\nAny discussion of the biggest player and coach news this offseason must start with LSU. Not only did Mulkey get the two best players in the transfer portal, she signed the No. 1 recruiting class, including two -- Mikaylah Williams and Aalyah Del Rosario -- of the top seven players in the 2023 class. Then early last month, the four-time national championship coach got a 10-year, $36 million contract extension, making her the highest paid coach in women's basketball.\nOut west, meanwhile, Lauren Betts' decision to leave Stanford for UCLA could signal a power shift in the Pac-12. The 6-foot-7 center was the top recruit in 2022 (and No. 3 in our transfer rankings) and had a promising showing for Team USA at the AmeriCup.\nAside from LSU, a handful of SEC schools did everything they could to keep up in the transfer portal:\nTennessee, seeking its first Final Four since 2008, when the Lady Vols won their eighth title, added a new backcourt. Destinee Wells (Belmont) and Jewel Spear (Wake Forest) are two scoring guards, something the Lady Vols have lacked in recent years.\nOle Miss brought in three new starters, and coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin didn't even need that many. Fresh off their first Sweet 16 since 2007, the Rebels have Kennedy Todd-Williams (North Carolina), KK Deans (Florida) and Kharyssa Richardson (Auburn) on what is now a deep and versatile roster.\nJoni Taylor joins \"The Paul Finebaum Show\" and reflects on Texas A&M's expectations, while emphasizing the spirit of coaching among the best in the SEC.\nOutside the SEC, TCU underwent the biggest shake-up from the end of the regular season until now. Of the more than four dozen Division I coaching changes this offseason, Mark Campbell from Sacramento State to the Horned Frogs has had the biggest impact so far.\nAfter seven years as an assistant at Oregon in which he spearheaded the recruitment of Sabrina Ionescu, Ruthy Hebard and Satou Sabally, and then two seasons with Hornets, which included the program's only NCAA tournament appearance, Campbell has already reformed TCU without even coaching a game. He plucked Jaden Owens (Baylor), Madison Conner (Arizona), Agnes Emma-Nnopu (Stanford) and Sedona Prince (Oregon) out of the portal, significantly improving a roster that went 1-17 in the Big 12 a year ago. -- Creme\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nAfter South Carolina's Boston, Laeticia Amihere, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton were all selected in the 2023 WNBA draft, a changing of the guard is headed to Columbia this fall. Dawn Staley has plenty of reinforcements ready to take the mantle, such as center Kamilla Cardoso and point guard Raven Johnson, but she also brings in the nation's No. 2-ranked recruiting class and was active in the transfer portal, signing Te-Hina Paopao from Oregon as well as Sakima Walker, the 2023 NJCAA player of the year.\nIn the Pac-12, USC returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014 and will look for its first appearance in the Associated Press preseason poll since 2011. Now the legendary program adds No. 1 overall recruit Juju Watkins and several experienced players from the portal. It is unclear if/when Aaliyah Gayles will make her college debut after recovering from being shot 10 times at a party in April 2022, but social media indicates she has been practicing. -- Philippou\nHow different did our projections look between our April 18 update shortly after LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy to our latest field of 68 on Sept. 19? These were the biggest women's Bracketology movers.\nBiggest riser: TCU\nNR to No. 41/projected Last Four Byes\nAs mentioned above, Campbell has reshaped the Horned Frogs into a veteran, NCAA tournament-worthy team. Once he finished all his work in the transfer portal, TCU was a No. 11 seed in last month's projection.\nOther risers\nMississippi State: No. 37/projected Last Four Byes to No. 21/projected No. 6 seed\nAfter two wins in the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs upgraded their talent, too. Lauren Park-Lane (Seton Hall), Darrione Rogers (DePaul) and Erynn Barnum (Arkansas) will give the offense more punch. The Bulldogs were already a tournament team, but Sam Purcell pushed his Bulldogs more safely into the field.\nTexas A&M: No. 44/projected Last Four In to No. 28/projected No. 7 seed\nThe Aggies were too young a year ago and finished 9-20. So Joni Taylor made it a priority to bring in some experience. Graduate student Endyia Rogers (Oregon), senior Aicha Coulibaly (Auburn) and redshirt junior Lauren Ware (Arizona) give Taylor some veterans to put around ultra-talented sophomore Janiah Barker.\nBiggest faller: Arkansas\nFrom No. 26/projected No. 7 seed to No. 44/projected Last Four In\nWhen Barnum left the Razorbacks for Mississippi State, she helped elevate the Bulldogs and left Arkansas without a proven go-to scorer.\nOther fallers\nNC State: From No. 25/projected No. 7 seed to No. 33/projected No. 9 seed\nThe Wolfpack got passed by a few teams because of portal inactivity. After losing Jakia Brown-Turner to Maryland, NC State didn't add anyone of impact. -- Creme"}
{"title": "Who's the player of the year in all 32 women's college basketball conferences?", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "Caitlin Clark is the clear favorite for the 2023-24 women's college basketball national player of the year. The Iowa guard became a household name last season, winning every major postseason award for which she was eligible. She even transcended women's basketball by taking home the Sullivan Award, given to the year's best amateur athlete.\nBut despite being the preseason front-runner, Clark has plenty of competition.\nPaige Bueckers is back from a season lost to a knee injury, and the UConn guard won most of the national player of the year honors when she and Clark were freshmen in 2020-21. LSU's Angel Reese also returns after outdueling Clark for a national championship and the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player in April.\nCameron Brink of Stanford and Elizabeth Kitley of Virginia Tech are two post players who have both played in the Final Four and can dominate, just in a different fashion than Clark.\nAll these players will be among the favorites to win player of the year in their respective leagues. But they aren't the only ones. It's time to break down the prospective winners in all 32 conferences.\nSome are fifth- and sixth-year seniors looking for one more season of success. Others are young players about to make their mark, or transfers from big-name schools looking to renew their careers at mid-majors. All will have a chance to pick up some hardware at season's end.\nNavigate to each league:\nAmerican | America East |  ACC |  Atlantic Sun | A-10 | Big 12 |  Big East |  Big Sky |  Big South |  Big Ten |  Big West |  CAA |  C-USA |  Horizon | Ivy | MAAC |  MAC |  MEAC |  MVC |  MW |  NEC |  OVC |  Pac-12 |  Patriot  |  SEC |  SoCon |  Southland |  SWAC |  Summit  |  Sun Belt |  WCC |  WAC\n \nDanae McNeal, 6-0, G, East Carolina Pirates\nAfter being named AAC Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player and first-team all-conference, the big prize is about the only honor left for McNeal to win as she enters her fifth season. McNeal's scoring average jumped from 8.4 PPG to 17.4 PPG, which was good for second in the league. She also ranked eighth in the country with 97 steals for the AAC tournament champs.\nTop competition: Sammie Puisis, 6-1, G, South Florida Bulls\nThe Bulls' top returning scorer at 15.6 PPG, Puisis also led the AAC in 3-point shooting percentage (38.7%).\n \nAdrianna Smith, 6-0, F, Maine Black Bears\nWith teammate and 2022 conference POY Anne Simon sidelined for much of last season with injuries, Smith came out of nowhere to win the award in 2023. Smith jumped from 2.1 points and 2.0 rebounds per game as a freshman to a league-leading 18.0 PPG and 9.5 RPG last year. Her 23.5 PPG and 10.3 RPG in conference games marked the first time since 1994 that an America East player averaged over 20 points and 10 rebounds.\nTop competition: Emma Utterback, 5-8, G, Vermont Catamounts\nThe America East leader in assists, Utterback is a big reason why the Catamounts had their best season in 13 years.\n \nElizabeth Kitley, 6-4, C, Virginia Tech Hokies\nAstonishingly consistent over the past three seasons, Kitley is the reigning two-time conference player of the year. Adding the honor this year would mean joining Alana Beard and Alyssa Thomas as the only three-time winners. Kitley has averaged 18.1, 18.2 and 18.2 points and 10.4, 9.8 and 10.7 rebounds per game the past three seasons all while shooting between 53.1% and 55.8% from the field.\nTop competition: Olivia Miles, 5-10, G, Notre Dame Fighting Irish\nMuch of Miles' All-American potential and Notre Dame's fate this season hinges on her recovery from a knee injury suffered late last season. It doesn't appear she will start the season on the court, but when she gets to a 100%, Miles might be the best passing point guard in the country.\n \nAntwainette Walker, 5-11, G, Eastern Kentucky Colonels\nAfter one season at Little Rock and two more at Marquette, Walker settled into EKU, earning ASUN Newcomer of the Year and first-team all-conference. She led the league in scoring (21.0 PPG) and steals (2.4 SPG) and was second in rebounding (9.4 RPG).\nTop competition: Ajulu Thatha, 6-1, F, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles\nA grad transfer from SIU Edwardsville, Thatha earned all-OVC honors with 13.7 points and a league-leading 9.7 rebounds per game. She will play her fifth year with the Eagles, looking to be the best player on the A-SUN's best team.\n \nMaye Toure, 6-1, F, Rhode Island Rams\nA summer of international basketball a year ago for the France native propelled her from a little-used player on Rhode Island's bench to the Rams' best player. She led the A-10 regular-season co-champs in scoring (13.8 PPG) and rebounding (8.2 RPG). An outstanding athlete and tireless worker, Toure might be ready to be the conference's best player.\nTop competition: Kyla McMakin, 5-11, G, Saint Louis Billikens\nIn her four collegiate seasons (including three at Longwood), McMakin has never averaged fewer than 17.2 points per game. Her 27 points against UMass in the A-10 title game propelled the Billikens to their first conference tournament championship.\n \nPaige Bueckers, 5-11, G, UConn Huskies\nIt feels so long ago that Bueckers was the best player in college basketball, but it was only 2020-21 that she took home every national player of the year. Injuries cost her much of 2021-22 and all of last season. But she showed her ability to bounce back when her recovery two years ago led to Huskies run to the national championship game. That included a Bridgeport Regional MOP and a Final Four all-tournament selection for Bueckers. Completely healthy, Bueckers will be back in the running for national honors again.\nTop competition: Aaliyah Edwards, 6-3, F, UConn Huskies\nUConn guard Azzi Fudd could be thrown into the mix here as well, with the Huskies expected to dominate the Big East if they stay healthy. Edwards is the one UConn star who has been healthy throughout her career, and she blossomed last season as one of the best frontcourt players in the country. She led the Huskies with 16.6 points per game and the Big East with a 58.9 field goal percentage.\n \nJamie Loera, 5-9, G, Eastern Washington Eagles\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nAfter three seasons with minimal playing time at Arizona State, Loera joined the Eagles and became the Big Sky's Defensive Player of the Year (2.6 SPG). She also ranked third in the conference in assists (5.1 APG) and scored 11.4 points per game.\nTop competition: Carmen Gfeller, 6-1, F, Montana Lady Griz\nAn all-conference honoree in each of the last three seasons, Gfeller led the Lady Griz in scoring (14.2 PPG) and emerged as one of the Big Sky's best shooters.\n \nLauren Bevis, 5-5, G, High Point Panthers\nSecond in the POY voting last year with Gardner-Webb, Bevis brings 15.4 points per game and 40.9% 3-point shooting to the Panthers for her bonus season.\nTop competition: Christabel Ezumah, 6-2, F, Campbell Fighting Camels\nBlossoming as a junior, Ezumah was named first-team all-Big South while setting career highs with 10.3 PPG and 9.3 RPG.\n \nRori Harmon, 5-6, G, Texas Longhorns\nOne of the best defensive players in the country regardless of position, Harmon is the glue that kept the Longhorns together on their way to a share of the Big 12 regular-season title. Her 7.4 assists per game were a program record, and she and Caitlin Clark were the only players in the country last season to average over 11 points, seven assists and five rebounds.\nTop competition: Darianna Littlepage-Buggs, 6-1, F, Baylor Bears\nA potential breakout star as a sophomore, Littlepage-Buggs was one of the best freshmen in the country last season. She was a unanimous choice as the top rookie in the Big 12. With the Bears now fully separated from the Kim Mulkey era, Littlepage-Buggs might be the face of the program.\n \nCaitlin Clark, 6-0, G, Iowa Hawkeyes\nThe Big Ten has a host of good players, but Clark as Big Ten Player of the Year might be the easiest prediction of the 32. There is no more dynamic scorer in the game, and she has also led the country in assists two years running. Her shooting range is incomparable, and no player elicits more excitement. Clark's career averages of 27.2 points, 7.9 assists and 7.0 rebounds are staggering.\nTop competition: Mackenzie Holmes 6-3, F, Indiana Hoosiers\nIn most leagues, in most years, Holmes would be a heavy favorite to be a conference player of the year. Clark makes that nearly impossible in the Big Ten. Holmes, whose decision to stay for a fifth year keeps Indiana among the best teams in the country, was the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and a first-team All-American.\n \nLily Wahinekapu, 5-7, G, Hawaii Rainbow Wahine\nIn two seasons Wahinekapu has been the Big West Freshman of the Year at Cal State Fullerton and a first-team all-conference team selection at Hawaii. She led the Rainbow Wahine in points (12.9 PPG), assists (2.9 APG), steals (1.7 SPG), minutes (32.2 MPG), 3-point percentage (33.1%) and free throws.\nTop competition: Evanne Turner, 5-9, G, UC Davis Aggies\nThe Aggies' all-time leading 3-point shooter, Turner led the Big West in scoring last season at 15.1 PPG.\n \nKylie Kornegay-Lucas, 5-10, G, Towson Tigers\nAfter leaving Virginia, Kornegay-Lucas has been the CAA Sixth Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. Her offense was on display last season as well, leading the Tigers in scoring (14.0 PPG), rebounding (7.3 RPG) and assists (4.0 PPG).\nTop competition: Jada Logan, 5-9, G, Charleston Cougars\nIn her first season with the Cougars, Logan was second in the CAA in scoring (18.0 PPG) and recorded the second triple-double in program history.\n \nSavannah Wheeler, 5-6, G, Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders\nWheeler was the top scorer (15.1 PPG) on a Blue Raiders' team that set the CUSA record for most league wins (18). She also led the Blue Raiders in assists.\nTop competition: Destiny Salary, 6-0, G, Western Kentucky Lady Toppers\nA former four-star recruit, Salary played the last two seasons at Ole Miss and now has a great opportunity with the Lady Toppers.\n \nDestiny Leo, 5-10, G, Cleveland State Vikings\nPrimed to be one of the best players in Horizon League history, Leo will be attempting to defend her 2023 Player of the Year trophy. For the second straight season, Leo led the league in scoring (17.9 PPG) and was among the country's best free throw shooters (91.1%).\nTop competition: Brooke Quarles-Daniels, 5-7, G, Oakland Golden Grizzlies\nOne of the most decorated recruits in Oakland history, Quarles-Daniels was the Horizon's best freshman a year ago and led the Golden Grizzlies with 12.1 points and 3.1 assists per game.\n \nAbbey Hsu, 5-11, G, Columbia Lions\nOne of the most prolific shooters in the country, Hsu set the Ivy single-season record for 3-pointers and ranked second in the country with 3.3 treys made per game. Her 17.8 points per game led the league -- and she could be even better after spending the summer competing with Team USA at the AmeriCup in Mexico.\nTop competition: Kaitlyn Chen, 5-9 G, Princeton Tigers\nLast season's winner and the Ivy League tournament Most Outstanding Player each of the last two years, Chen remains the leader on the Ivy League's best team.\n \nAaliyah Parker, 5-9, G, Niagara Purple Eagles\nThe only underclassman on the all-MAC first-team, Parker led the conference is scoring (16.9 PPG) and ranked second in the country with 3.4 steals per game. That all helped the Purple Eagles to the postseason as a Division I program for the first time in their history.\nTop competition: Anajah Brown, 6-1, F, Siena Saints\nIf the Saints are to challenge for their first regular-season title since 2004, Brown, coming off a third-team all-MAAC season, will have to be one of the conference's best players.\n \nQuinesha Lockett, 5-10, G, Toledo Rockets\nWith one of the best three-year runs in program history, Lockett will be on every national mid-major player of the year list. She was voted the Mid-American's best player a year ago after averaging 17.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals per game.\nTop competition: Reagan Bass, 6-1, F, Akron Zips\nThe only underclassman to make the all-conference first team, Bass ranked in the top 10 in scoring (17.1 PPG), rebounding (7.7 RPG), field goal percentage (51.3%) and blocks (1.1 BPG).\n \nDiamond Johnson, 5-5, G, Norfolk State Spartans\nFew players in the MEAC have ever had the résumé of Johnson. After an all-Big Ten freshman team season at Rutgers, Johnson was the ACC's Sixth Player of the Year in 2022 and NC State's leading scorer (12.3 PPG) last season. Her presence makes the Spartans a heavy favorite for a third consecutive regular-season title.\nTop competition: Destiny Howell, 6-0, G, Howard Bison\nLast year's winner, Howell led the MEAC in scoring (16.8 PPG) and 3-point field goal percentage (35.6%).\n \nKatelyn Young, 6-1, F, Murray State Racers\nHad the Racers been more successful last season (8th place in the MVC), Young might be going for a POY three-peat. She won it in the OVC in 2022 and then led the MVC in scoring (20.1 PPG) and rebounding (8.1 RPG) a year ago. According to HerHoopStats' advance metrics, she was 12th in the country in offensive win shares.\nTop competition: Grace Boffeli, 6-1, F, Northern Iowa Panthers\nIf UNI is going to win its first MVC title since 2016, Boffeli will need to have a big year. Duplicating last year's 16.1 PPG, 9.2 RPG and 55.3% shooting from the field would qualify.\n \nDesi-Rae Young, 6-1, C, UNLV Lady Rebels\nYoung won MWC Player of the Year in 2022 and then had an even better season last year but lost out to Colorado State's McKenna Hofschild. The award is Young's to lose this time around. The Lady Rebels have been the dominant team in the MWC for consecutive seasons, and Young is a big reason why. Last year she led the league in rebounding (10.2 RPG) and was second in points per game (17.8) and field goal percentage (59.4%).\nTop competition: Allyson Fertig, 6-4, C, Wyoming Cowgirls\nThe two best players in the MWC might be centers, a rarity in the modern game, but it was Fertig (13.6 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 59.6 FG%) who elevated the Cowgirls to second place in the conference and a WNIT berth.\n \nNy'Ceara Pryor, 5-3, G, Sacred Heart Pioneers\nNo freshman dominated her league the way Pryor did in the NEC. She led the conference in scoring (17.7 PPG), assists (4.3 APG) and steals (3.7 SPG) and became the first in league history to win player of the year, freshman of the year and defensive player of the year in the same season.\nTop competition: Jayme DeCesare, 5-5, G, Merrimack Warriors\nMerrimack enjoyed its best season since moving to Division I in 2019-2020. DeCesare was a big part of it with 10.2 points and 3.5 rebounds per game and a first-team all-league nod.\n \nSharnecce Currie-Jelks, 6-2, F, UT Martin Skyhawks\nExpect the Skyhawks to be back near the top of the OVC like they were in 2020 and 2021 -- and expect Currie-Jelks to lead them. Last season's OVC Freshman of the Year was second in scoring (15.2 PPG), fifth in rebounding (6.9 RPG) and first in field goal percentage (53.9%).\nTop competition: Macy McGlone, 6-3, F, Eastern Illinois Panthers\nWith the graduation of Lariah Washington, expect even more opportunity for the Panthers' second-leading scorer and the OVC's top returning rebounder.\n \nCameron Brink, 6-4, F, Stanford Cardinal\nAs last season wore on it became clear that Brink was Stanford's best player. That will be the case from day one this year, when she will be the No. 1 option for the Cardinal every trip up the floor. She set career highs in points, rebounds and assists in 2022-23, but most notable were her 3.5 blocks per game. Those solidified her status as one of the best defensive players in the country.\nTop competition: Alissa Pili, 6-2, F, Utah Utes\nLast year's winner, Pili led the conference in scoring (20.7 PPG) and field goal percentage (59.0%). In her first year with the Utes after transferring from USC, Pili transformed the Utes into an elite program, earning their highest NCAA tournament seed ever (No. 2).\n \nLex Therien, 6-1, F, Loyola Maryland Greyhounds\nHer team's improvement from a 4-14 league mark might be necessary for Therien's candidacy, but she has done plenty on her own, averaging a double-double in each of her first two seasons.\nTop competition: Caitlin Weimar, 6-4, F, Boston University Terriers\nVoted the league's best defensive player last season, Weimar was also BU's leading scorer (15.5 PPG) and rebounder (10.0 RPG).\n \nRickea Jackson, 6-2, F, Tennessee Lady Vols\nDespite a four-year career in the SEC that has seen her average 17.4 points per game over time with both Mississippi State and the Lady Vols, Jackson hasn't received as much attention as some other conference stars. That might change this season. Her game grew more efficient in her first season in Knoxville. Jackson's 54.8 field goal percentage was a career best, and her 19.2 PPG ranked third in the conference.\nTop competition: Angel Reese, 6-3, F, LSU Tigers\nWith the arrivals of Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow to LSU, Reese's numbers that were so eye-popping a year ago (23.0 PPG, 15.4 RPG) might take a hit, but she still easily qualifies as one of the best players in the SEC and in the country.\n \nRachel Rose, 5-7, G, Wofford Terriers\nOn Rose's shoulders, the Terriers won their first conference championship in 2023. She led the team in nearly every offensive statistical category, and the conference coaches selected the sophomore as the player of the year. Another season like that and Rose will probably win over the media, too.\nTop competition: Raven Thompson, 5-10, F, Chattanooga Mocs\nThompson's 19-point, nine-rebound performance in the SoCon tournament title game prevented Wofford from reaching its first NCAA tournament. That earned her tournament Most Outstanding Player after she had already won SoCon Freshman of the Year.\n \nAlecia Westbrook, 6-1, F, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi Islanders\nLast season's winner, Westbrook has averaged a double-double and won the SLC's Defensive Player of the Year in consecutive years. As the Islanders' leading scorer and the league's leading rebounder, Westbrook helped Texas A&M-CC win its first conference championship in 2023 (shared with SE Louisiana).\nTop competition: Akasha Davis, 6-2, F, Lamar Cardinals\nDavis followed up a freshman of the year campaign by finishing second in the league in scoring (14.6 PPG) and rebounding (8.8 RPG) and first in field goal percentage (61.4%) as a sophomore.\n \nKacie Borowicz, 5-7, G, North Dakota Fighting Hawks\nThe Summit League's leading scorer each of the last two seasons, Borowicz decided to come back for her bonus year for a three-peat. Borowicz also topped the Summit in assists last season and has been one of the country's best free throw shooters in her four years in Grand Forks.\nTop competition: Hannah Cooper, 5-7, G, Oral Roberts Golden Eagles\nCooper went from 6.5 points per game in 2021-22 to 20.3 last year, good for second in the league to Borowicz. She topped the Summit in steals (2.5 SPG) and minutes (36.9 MPG).\n \nDomonique Davis, 5-6, G, Southern Miss Lady Eagles\nDespite a drop-off in her 3-point shooting, Davis set a career-high in scoring (17.2 PPG), helping the Lady Eagles to a three-way tie for first place, their first regular-season conference championship in 29 years.\nTop competition: Terren Ward, 5-11, G, Georgia Southern Eagles\nOne year after winning Sun Belt Sixth Player of the Year, Ward increased her scoring and rebounding, leading the conference at 18.4 points per game.\n \nTi'lan Boler, 6-1, G, Jackson State Lady Tigers\nThe most versatile player on the league's best team, Boler was especially good down the stretch, scoring in double figures in five of the season's final six games as the Lady Tigers won their third consecutive SWAC regular-season title.\nTop competition: Chanel Wilson, 5-7, F, Bethune-Cookman Wildcats\nAfter getting minimal playing time in two years at Indiana, Wilson transferred to Bethune-Cookman and was the SWAC Newcomer of the Year.\n \nTrinity San Antonio, 5-10, G, Grand Canyon Lopes\nSan Antonio's decision to transfer from Cal Baptist to Grand Canyon could shift the fate of the two programs fighting for a WAC title in 2023-24. San Antonio was a first-team all-WAC selection after filling the stat sheet with 14.1 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.7 APG and 2.3 SPG.\nTop competition: Breaunna Gillen, 5-9, G, Utah Tech Trailblazers\nGillen enters her fifth season in St. George as the Trailblazers' all-time assist leader. She was the league leader at 6.5 APG a year ago and finished second in scoring (17.8 PPG).\n \nYvonne Ejim, 6-1, F, Gonzaga Bulldogs\nBecoming a full-time starter for the first-time last season, Ejim led the defending regular-season champs in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, and was a finalist for the Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Kaylynne Truong, 5-8, G, Gonzaga Bulldogs\nEjim's biggest challengers are likely to come from her own team. Truong was last year's winner after scoring 15.8 points per game and leading the WCC with 5.0 assists per game."}
{"title": "Wood: Difficult to keep making weight, moving up after Warrington title defense", "date": "2023-10-05 16:31:25", "text": "Leigh Wood believes Saturday's world title defense could be his last as making the featherweight limit is becoming increasingly difficult for him.\nWood (27-3, 16 KOs), the WBA featherweight champion and ESPN's No. 2 at 126 pounds, defends his title against English rival Josh Warrington (31-2-1, 8 KOs) on Saturday at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, England.\nWood, 35, managed his weight perfectly for his last outing in May, which resulted in an impressive performance as he contained and outpointed the dangerous Mauricio Lara after flooring him early on. The Mexican went into the fight as ESPN's No. 1 at featherweight after stopping Wood in the seventh round of their first fight in February, but was stripped of the belt the day before for missing the weight.\n\"It gets harder every time to make the featherweight limit,\" Wood told ESPN. \"The last time against Lara was harder than before and Lara not making the weight made me feel even more sorry for myself. I know what it is like.\n\"I'm 35 now and I've been making this weight for a long time, it doesn't get easier. I think it takes a little bit out of me and I would be stronger at junior lightweight, definitely. There's nothing more I can cut, except if I was to cut an arm off.\"\nFor Wood, the climax of his career could be at junior lightweight even if he beats Leeds native Warrington. Both are two-time world champions in the last phase of their careers looking to set up a big fight for next year.\n\"I said two more fights after I beat Lara, but it's a fight-by-fight basis really,\" Wood said. \"I don't want to retire from boxing until I'm the first boxer to headline at the City Ground in Nottingham. The timing meant we couldn't do the Warrington fight there in the summer -- the ground had a new pitch laid [before the English Premier League season started in August] and even the Nottingham Forest players couldn't train on it.\"\nJoe Cordina (16-0, 9 KOs), the IBF junior lightweight champion, is a possibility for the winner of Saturday's fight in Sheffield, as like Wood and Warrington he is promoted by Matchroom. Cordina defends his belt against Edward Vazquez on Nov. 4 in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\"My focus is on Josh Warrington but I'm confident and if I did move up Joe Cordina is a possibility, he's a great fighter,\" Wood told ESPN. \"My dream is to fight at the City Ground, and I have to win this one to make it happen. It would have to be a unification fight or perhaps a rematch with Michael Conlan to keep me at featherweight.\"\nWood's career leapt from domestic to elite level when he knocked out Xu Can in the last round for the WBA world title in July 2021, before doing the same to Michael Conlan in 2022's ESPN fight of the year. Despite his strong recent performances, Wood is aware that Warrington represents a different challenge.\n\"My discipline and patience was what I was pleased most about against Lara,\" Wood told ESPN. \"I had to stay switched on when there was not a lot happening because he likes to jump in and surprise you. I learned that the hard way in the first fight with him. Patience was also key in the second fight, not to go leaving myself open.\nWoods believes he needs a different approach against Warrington because he's a different style of a fighter.\n\"There are things he does well but there are areas I know I can exploit against him,\" Wood said.\nWood insists the pressure is on Warrington this time after Warrington lost the IBF belt to Luis Alberto Lopez a year ago. Warrington, 32, was also stopped by Lara in 2021, broke his jaw in a hard-fought stoppage win over Kiko Martinez in 2022, and then lost a majority decision against to Lopez.\n\"There's a lot of pressure on Josh for this one, he knows it will be very hard to come back from another defeat,\" Wood said. \"He's not fought for a while and it favors me that I have momentum, I'm better when I'm active. This is my third fight inside eight months, activity has served me well through my career. I think Josh is boxing well, I don't think he's on the slide and he lost a close fight versus Lopez.\n\"There's a lot on the line for both of us.\"\nOn the undercard, Cecilia Braekhus -- once the biggest star in women's boxing -- gets a chance to revive her career at the age of 42.\nThe Colombia-born, Norway-based boxer challenges Terri Harper for the WBA and vacant WBO junior middleweight titles after suffering two losses in her last three fights.\nBraekhus (37-2, 9 KOs) lost back-to-back decisions to Jessica McCaskill for the undisputed welterweight championship in 2020 and 2021.\nBut Harper (14-1-1, 6 KOs), 26, from Doncaster not far from Sheffield, will be boosted by home support as well as her recent form and will be making a second WBA title defense.\nShe said: \"I've got to take away her jab and stay busy. I believe I can stop her.\""}
{"title": "Ross Chastain is too busy to trade barbs with NASCAR rivals", "date": "2023-10-05 17:37:36", "text": "HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. -- Ross Chastain is very comfortable at Waffle House.\nThat is where he is seated on a Tuesday morning, two days after finishing dead last at Talladega, which happened one week after finishing second at Texas, and only five days ahead of Sunday's NASCAR playoff 12-teams-to-eight cutoff event on the Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval, where he will start the race sitting three positions and nine points on the wrong side of that elimination line. So close, but so much work to do.\nYet here the three-time Cup Series racer winner is, the maestro behind the Hail Melon maneuver at Martinsville Speedway one year ago that became a crossover social media sensation, calmly knocking down coffee, over-easy eggs, grits and a peanut-butter-smeared waffle. He's in a bright yellow booth that is sandwiched directly between an off-duty landscaping crew and four vacationing husbands who have chosen to sit across the restaurant from their wives. No one in the place, not the patrons, not the java-pouring server, not even the batter-splattered cook at the griddle, has any idea that there is a race car driver in their midst.\nAnd not just any stock car racer but NASCAR's current lightning rod.\nThe guy who inspires as many boos as cheers. See: the seemingly 50/50 split of praise and ridicule that followed the Hail Melon (and a NASCAR rule change to prevent it from happening again), even after it cut through the NFL noise to put NASCAR on the media map and earned him a spot in 2022's Championship Four.\nThe guy whose name now comes up even when he isn't involved. See: a NASCAR on Fox Instagram post of Saturday's Truck Series fight between Matt Crafton and Nick Sanchez that produced nearly 900 comments. The top comment reads: \"I don't know how but it was Chastain's fault.\"\nThe guy who can't seem to get through a month without eliciting barb-covered sound bites about him from the sport's biggest stars.\nMartin Truex Jr. in August: \"Get your s--- together.\"\nKyle Busch, same day: \"I got Chastained.\"\nDenny Hamlin on his podcast after a wreck with Chastain in March: \"I think that Ross doesn't like it when I speak his name in the media and when I have this microphone. I told him I have a microphone and I'm going to call it like I see it. Until you get a microphone, you can then say whatever you want about me.\"\nSitting here in this Waffle House booth north of Charlotte, Ross Chastain is given that microphone. A chance to smother and cover the NASCAR world with a sharpened, witty response. Tape is rolling. The platform of the Worldwide Leader in Sports awaits.\nBut his reaction is the same now as it has been whenever he received similar \"Here's a flamethrower\" invitations from other outlets and shows. He shakes his head and smiles.\n\"I'm good, man. I've got too much work to do,\" the driver from Florida says to ESPN. \"I don't know what a response to anything said about me is going to do. It would be easy, sure. It would be easy to fire back on Twitter or go on a radio show or podcast and respond to stuff that's been said about me, and I am sure that it would get a big response. A lot of clicks and likes and dislikes and whatever. For a few hours, maybe a day. But the next day, you know what? I would still have the same work to do, and now I'd be a day behind because I spent it doing all of that stuff that doesn't matter. The work matters.\"\nHe smiles again.\n\"The best response is in results, and the only way to achieve results is through hard work.\"\nChastain knows hard work. In fact, he has arrived here for late breakfast having already put in a day's worth of it. There's body work, which he has just done for a couple of hours on the basketball court under the eye of a former college coach. There's racing work, having already conferred with Josh Wise, former NASCAR competitor and USAC champion, who is now a driver development and performance adviser with Team Chevy, walking racers through their physical and mental preparation before each race.\nBy week's end Chastain will have also been coached up by everyone from crew chief Phil Surgen to Olympic speed skating legend Dan Jansen, a longtime Charlotte-area resident, who helps the racer dive even further into his physical and mental shape. All the while he is ingesting all the data he can possibly process from throughout 2023 as well as last year's Roval event, where he finished 37th. That won't be good enough this time around.\n\"It's a lot, but it's all right here,\" he says, thumping the cover of ... a leather-bound notebook? \"I write everything down in here. I'm old-school like that.\"\nRoss Chastain is old-school all the time. That's why he still loves Waffle House.\n\"Waffle House, or sausage, egg and cheese biscuit in the truck, or even a Snickers bar and a soda in the truck. That's breakfast, man,\" he says as he busts the yolk from the white. \"I don't eat this as much as I used to, but I probably still eat it more than I should. I guarantee you my dad and brother still had one of those combos this morning on the way to work.\"\nThat would be down in Punta Gorda, where father Ralph and brother Chad, six years younger, still spend their days farming, managing thousands of acres in South Florida that produce more than 2,000 watermelons per acre. The work is grueling, hot and intense.\nWhen Ralph started putting Ross to work as a kid, the problem was never getting his son to work, it was getting him to slow down. Whenever Ross was behind the wheel of one of the sawed-off school buses used to transport the melons or a tractor rigged to plow or grade land, the kid had his foot in the throttle, seeking to beat whoever was doing the same job a few rows over.\nThe Chastains, eighth-generation watermelon farmers, worked six days a week. On the seventh day, they rested. Ross slowed down only to park in front of the television to watch his hero Jeff Gordon battle rivals on the racetrack, beginning with Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace and then on to the next-gen likes of Busch and Kevin Harvick.\n\"Every step of my ladder wasn't supposed to happen,\" he recalls now. \"When I was 12 and we started, we were just supposed to do some local racing in Florida and nothing else. Then we were like, 'You know what? Let's try the next level, just one race, just so we can say that we did it.' Then that turned into the next step and the next step and all along the way.\"\nThe watermelon industry, enamored with one of its own moving up the NASCAR ladder, started providing some financial help. That has been framed up by Chastain critics as a silver-spoon kid buying rides, but, spoiler alert, bringing sponsorship to help land gigs is the way of the motorsports world.\n\"There are plenty of guys with rich daddies backing up a truckload of cash that keeps the guy in that car even when he's clearly a total disaster,\" explained Stacy Compton, the former Cup Series racer and ESPN analyst, not long after giving Chastain his first ride in the NASCAR Truck Series in 2011, replacing just-departed Justin Marks. \"Then there are the guys who have just enough to get themselves into a car for a race or two and they know if they are bad, the money's going to run out, the ride is going back to the shop and they all disappear forever. That guy, the second guy, you are never going to outwork that guy because he is literally racing for his racing life.\"\nChastain has raced for his racing life for so long that he doesn't know how else to go about it. Since that debut for Compton on July 29, 2011, he has made 493 starts across NASCAR's three national series, and at one point he set the record for most consecutive starts in all of those series to start a single season. It took him 66 tries spread out over nine years to finally earn the first of his four Truck Series wins, 132 tries over five seasons to grab the first of his three Xfinity Series wins and 121 starts spread out over six years before he shocked the world with the first of his three Cup Series wins, on the road course in Austin, Texas, on March 27, 2022.\n\"What people don't see, and this isn't unique to me, but they don't see the fighting to make it, is that you spend your time between those races not working on racing,\" Chastain says, sitting up straight over his untouched toast. \"It's phone calls and sales calls and business meetings. That's what this notebook was full of then. And for every deal you get done, there are 10 times that many that don't. Or deals that do and then, for whatever reason, stuff beyond your control, they fall apart.\"\nThe Smash™️ pic.twitter.com/aBJ8e99Wgi\nHe says he felt an indescribable relief in 2021 when new boss Chip Ganassi told him to stop with all of that other stuff and just worry about racing. Then, at midseason, while at a test session, he learned that Ganassi had sold the team to Marks, the racer whose vacancy with Compton had given Chastain his big league break a decade earlier. Newly rebranded Trackhouse Racing was an unknown at best, and even after Chastain had been assured that he would still be with the team, switching from the No. 42 Chevy to the No. 1 in 2022, the arrival of NASCAR's one-size-fits-all Next Gen car was the biggest unknown of them all.\n\"When 2022 started, we knew we had a little bit of an edge and I could feel it as soon as we started unloading for practice at the racetrack every weekend,\" Chastain remembers now of the season when he won not once but twice, including the Hail Melon and his rise through the ranks, to the ire of those who characterized it as reckless. \"I remember feeling this super-intense feeling of, 'Man, you'd better take advantage of this now because you don't know how long this is going to last.' So, yeah, as a driver, I attacked. If there was an opening, I was driving it in there. I was driving like I had better do it now because one day it might all go away. And that's how I felt.\"\nIt's a feeling straight from the farm. Watermelons are harvested only 100 days per year. Anyone who doesn't figure out how to get all they can out of those 100 days will spend the other 265 sifting through the want ads.\n\"This year, as the other teams have caught up to us, you have to change the way you approach the day,\" Chastain says. \"When you don't have the fastest car every week, you can't be in attack mode all the time. You pick your spots. But when you are there, when the chance comes, you can't hesitate. If you do, someone else won't and it's gone.\"\nChastain has only recently been introduced to the term \"imposter syndrome,\" explained to him by his longtime girlfriend, Erika Anne Turner. The official definition, as written by the National Library of Medicine is \"a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills or accomplishments among high-achieving individuals.\" In other words, a fear of being exposed as a fraud, even among people whose accomplishments are many and indisputable.\nIn the NASCAR garage, a world full of rags-to-riches stories, it is a common refrain and feeling. Richard Childress, a high school dropout who has gone on to win six Cup Series titles as a team owner and made countless millions across multiple industries, speaks of recurring dreams that he is in his office when people rush in and begin taking everything away, telling him the jig is up and he has to go back to being homeless in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Childress says Dale Earnhardt confessed to having the same feelings.\nIt isn't a long psychological walk to understand that anyone who keeps that kind of feeling compartmentalized all the time would, like Chastain, employ every type of coach he can; take every ride he can every weekend, even if it doesn't pay; and spend his own money jetting to driving schools to drive Mazda Miatas around road courses, all in an effort to find the edge that will keep him not even up front but gainfully employed.\n\"I don't have any doubt that I should be here, but yes, there is always that feeling of not being here tomorrow,\" Chastain says in reaction to a discussion about Childress' and Earnhardt's fears. \"I absolutely catch myself looking around on Sundays and thinking, 'Man, I am out here racing with Kevin Harvick! And Denny Hamlin! And Kyle Busch!' I can't believe it. It's the dream, the dream I had as a kid, and you don't want to wake up from it.\"\nThat dream, the one conjured up by the kid racing roofless school buses full of watermelons through the fields of Punta Gorda, did not include being called out publicly by those same drivers, but that's the reality of life as the Melon Man. A student of NASCAR history, he also knows he is in good company. Harvick, Hamlin, Busch, Brad Keselowski and even Gordon, they all spent their formative Cup Series days having to race amid scoldings from their elders and contemporaries. In a way, it's the ultimate compliment, no matter how much it might hurt.\nSometimes, they even turn into actual compliments. Just last week, Hamlin said of Chastain's current NASCAR playoffs effort: \"The dude keeps making chicken salad out of chicken s---, most weeks. I mean, he does. Not saying his car is chicken s---, but where [Trackhouse] is at, he's optimizing his day 95% of the time.\"\nChastain knows it all. He reads it all. He is aware of when he has won over the legends and he is aware of when he has pissed them off. He also knows he is perfectly capable of defending himself. We all do. Just ask Noah Gragson.\nBut don't bother trying to bait him into doing so at the Huntersville Waffle House. There is too much to do.\n\"I can't race any harder or work any harder than I already do,\" he says, throwing his napkin like a syrup-stained surrender flag onto the table. Ross Chastain is officially looking ahead to Sunday, merely the latest chapter in a lifetime of racing do-or-dies. \"But I can race smarter. That work is never done.\""}
{"title": "USC at Michigan? Ohio State at Oregon? Big Ten's best matchups in 2024", "date": "2023-10-05 20:05:00", "text": "With the additions of Oregon, Washington, USC and UCLA, the Big Ten conference revealed its matchups for the 2024 to 2028 seasons on Thursday.\nThose matchups included 12 protected annual games, preserving rivalries and games of historical significance such as Ohio State-Michigan and the matchup of newcomers USC and UCLA.\nThere is a lot to digest with the matchups being released, and while we don't know exact dates and times, we do know which teams will face each other and how the future of the Big Ten will be shaped. Our writers analyzed the new Big Ten, breaking down the best games and the toughest and easiest matchups.\nJump to:\n2024 matchups\nTom VanHaaren: The 2024 schedule has a lot of really exciting matchups, but I think I'm most excited for USC traveling to Ann Arbor to play Michigan. We don't know yet if Caleb Williams will be the quarterback for the Trojans, but with Lincoln Riley as the head coach, we know the offense will be explosive. The Wolverines have put together a balanced team and have a defense that has stifled opponents this season. Putting USC's offense against Michigan's defense would be fun to watch.\nBlake Baumgartner: Ohio State's visit to Eugene to tangle with the Ducks is another great matchup. The two schools last met in Columbus back in 2021, with Oregon pulling off the upset of a top-10 Buckeyes team. Dan Lanning has been doing work on the recruiting trail and the race to succeed Bo Nix at quarterback will be fun to watch, as top-25 overall prospect Michael Van Buren (No. 23 overall in 2024) headlines a class that ESPN has ranked fourth. Kyle McCord has another year of eligibility for Ryan Day & Co. and will only be better following his experience in 2023.\nPaolo Uggetti: I'm with Tom and Blake, but for the sake of variety, how about Penn State traveling to USC in a rematch of the thrilling 2017 Rose Bowl? Sure, the players and some coaches are different now, but both offenses should be plenty explosive enough to provide a fitting encore. Really, any Big Ten team traveling to Los Angeles for a game against USC will make for an awesome environment not only because of the number of out-of-town fans who will make the trip, but also the transplants who already call the city their home.\nVanHaaren: Washington has a pretty tough schedule in 2024 with Iowa, Oregon, Penn State, Michigan, UCLA and USC all on tap. They'll have to travel to Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Penn State. That Penn State game on the road could be a tough one considering how hard it is to play at Beaver Stadium. The Huskies also will have to travel to Rutgers, which will be a hike across the country. Washington is at home against Michigan, Northwestern, UCLA and USC, but that is a lot to take on in one season considering the team will likely be breaking in a new quarterback after Michael Penix Jr.'s eligibility runs out.\nBaumgartner: Michigan has four games on its 2024 schedule that immediately pop off the page -- road dates with Washington and Ohio State to couple with games in Ann Arbor against USC and Oregon. Having to make only one trek out to the West Coast helps logistically. Much has been made about the quality (or lack thereof) of the Wolverines' nonconference slate the past few seasons. We knew that was likely to take care of itself with the addition of the four Pac-12 schools. But to finally see what that looks like on paper hammers home how difficult it will be to win a Big Ten crown, let alone back-to-back titles as the Wolverines have done the past two years.\nUggetti: Nebraska will have to go on the road to both Ohio State and USC in 2024. While the rest of their road games (Indiana, Iowa, Purdue) as well as their home games (Illinois, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin) don't present too tough a task, the two matchups against juggernauts on their home turf are enough to make their schedule next season one of the tougher ones in the conference. And given how they've looked so far this season, one can almost assume those two games will be near-automatic losses for the Cornhuskers.\nUggetti: In terms of big-name teams, I think Ohio State got the easiest draw in Year 1 of the new Big Ten. The Buckeyes travel to Northwestern, Michigan State, Penn State and will have to go to Oregon as their lone West Coast trip. They avoid playing USC, Washington and UCLA. That trip to Autzen will be much anticipated and, aside from perhaps the road trip to Penn State and hosting Michigan in the annual rivalry game, could be Ohio State's toughest task of the season.\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nVanHaaren: Rutgers has USC, UCLA and Washington, which will be a difficult stretch. But the Scarlet Knights don't have Michigan, Penn State or Ohio State on their schedule. That seems like a good trade-off, especially because the USC game is the only West Coast away game Rutgers will have in 2024. The matchups against Illinois, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington and Wisconsin will all be at home.\nBaumgartner: Logistically, Iowa's schedule stands out. Only once do the Hawkeyes have to travel out to the Pacific time zone -- for a game at the Rose Bowl with UCLA. Yes, a trip to Columbus is on the docket to face the Buckeyes, but road games against Michigan State, Minnesota and Maryland seem manageable. Oregon, Michigan and Penn State aren't on the schedule.

{"title": "Are United's making Hojlund's life harder by asking him to do the (near) unprecedented?", "date": "2023-10-05 20:18:19", "text": "Gab & Juls analyse Rasmus Hojlund's performance in Man United's 4-3 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. (1:04)\nAt the risk of piling on to the laundry list of Manchester United concerns -- back-to-back Champions League defeats, four defeats in seven games to open the Premier League season, no sign of the football Erik Ten Hag played at Ajax, Antony being questioned by police in two countries for assaulting women, Jadon Sancho exiled from the squad, Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martínez injured, the club being wholly or partly up for sale and nobody meeting the owners' expectations, Harry Maguire sticking around and the Glazers, too -- I wonder if it's time to fret over Rasmus Hojlund.\nIt has nothing to do with his attitude or his production thus far. Despite being injured going into the season, the young center-forward has looked, sharp, motivated and gifted. He scored a fine goal against Galatasaray and was among those least to blame for the home defeat.\nRather, I'm concerned about the enormity of the task in front of him: playing center-forward at his age on a team of United's magnitude at a time when all is not well and still living up to expectations.\nHojlund does not turn 21 until Feb. 4. He reportedly cost the club a whopping €70m ($73.5m) in transfer fees, rising to €80m ($84m) this past summer. To put this in context, according to Transfermarkt, only 42 players in the history of the game have changed clubs for bigger fees. Of those, just 11 were under the age of 21 and of those 11, none was a central striker, and none moved to a club facing the sort of turmoil currently engulfing United.\nIt's not just that Hojlund moved to an enormous club for enormous money at a very young age, either; it's that he will have to get serious playing time of the sort that center-forwards aren't usually afforded at his age. Why? Because United are in four competitions and they only have two other realistic options up front. One is Marcus Rashford, who is arguably their best player and has been far more productive playing out wide. The other is Anthony Martial, who has scored all of 11 goals in his last 67 league appearances. He also has a poor injury record and hasn't impressed in a long, long time, which explains why his contract expires in June and there has been no talk of extending it.\nAll this translates to a lot of minutes on the pitch for Hojlund, and that's not something we see very often at that age, especially at a major club with a lot of pressure.\nClubs are more willing these days than they were in the past to put their faith in youngsters, but when they do, it's overwhelmingly in certain positions: out on the wing, perhaps in attacking midfield, occasionally at fullback. These are roles where, rightly or wrongly, mistakes are easier to tolerate by fans, media and (crucially) teammates. Precocious center-forwards -- especially ones like Hojlund -- are not quite as rare as teenage keepers, but they're not far off either.\nTake the last five seasons in Europe's Big Five leagues and a cut off of, say, 60% of a team's minutes (2,052) as a reasonable amount for a starter. That's 118 teams multiplied by five seasons, which is 590 times it could have happened. Well, it only happened on 21 occasions and once you whittle down the players who split their between up front and out wide -- like João Félix in 2019-20 at Atletico Madrid, Christian Kouamé at Genoa in 2018-19 or Amine Gouiri at Nice in 2020-21 -- and stick to proper center-forwards, you're left with just 17 instances where this has happened.\nOf those, there are just two examples in the Premier League: Armando Broja at Southampton (2021-22), and Rashford at Manchester United (2018-19). And Rashford isn't a great comp here, since United often played a front two that season and unlike Hojlund, he'd been at the club from a young age and had 2½ years as a regular under his belt when he did it.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nElsewhere around Europe, you have Erling Haaland, who did it twice (no surprise there), but we're talking about a phenom and an outlier. With a few exceptions, most who did it were at small clubs with far less pressure, where it was OK to \"chuck in the kid\" and see what happened -- I'm thinking here of guys like Jonathan Burkardt at Mainz (2021-22) or Youssef En-Nesyri at Leganes (2018-19). The biggest clubs where it occurred were Real Sociedad (Alexander Isak, 2020-21), Fiorentina (Dusan Vlahovic, 2020-21), Eintracht Frankfurt (Luka Jovic, 2018-19, though he often played in a front two with Sebastian Haller) and Lille (Victor Osimhen in 2019-20 and Jonathan David in 2020-21, though, again both often played in a front two).\nYou might also notice that none of those guys -- except for Osimhen in 2019-20 -- played Champions League football and that three of them played in empty stadiums during the pandemic, rather than in front of 70,000 at Old Trafford.\nRob Dawson reacts to loud boos at Old Trafford after Erik ten Hag's decision to sub Anthony Martial on for Rasmus Hojlund.\nThe bottom line? United appear to be asking Hojlund to do something that's near unprecedented in Europe's major leagues. The fact that Haaland did it, he's also from Scandinavia and there's a certain assonance to their names is pretty meaningless here. Using him as a benchmark is also unfair. We know United's budget was stretched to the limit this past summer, but with hindsight, you wonder if maybe they wouldn't have been better off picking up a veteran striker, ideally on loan, to take some of the workload off Hojlund and help him develop.\n(OK, this is where some will giggle and blurt out: \"What? You mean like Wout Weghorst?\" Laugh all you like about Weghorst, but he cost nothing in fees, gave United some meaningful minutes and they finished third in the Premier League, won the League Cup and went on a deep Europa League run with him.)\nHeck, Hojlund himself benefited from being part of an attacking corps rather than the main man last season at Atalanta, when he scored 10 goals in 34 appearances. He shared playing time with two veteran center-forwards like Luis Muriel and Duván Zapata and only made 20 starts, very rarely up front on his own. And he was the team's third-leading scorer, after Ademola Lookman and Teun Koopmeiners. There was no European football to worry about, and the focus was squarely on his personal growth.\nHojlund has impressive tools -- we can debate the transfer fee another time -- and it's entirely possible that a season of apparent hardship and turmoil at the club will only toughen him up even further and not impact his development arc one bit. But the frustrating thing is that it didn't need to be this way. There was no reason to make his job that much more difficult and the club's massive investment in him that much more difficult to come to fruition."}
{"title": "WNBA trendsetters: Why Hammon, Brondello are just the start of former players as Finals coaches", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:47", "text": "When the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty tip off the WNBA Finals on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App), the coaching matchup between Becky Hammon and Sandy Brondello will be 26 years in the making.\nAlthough former WNBA players have coached teams to the Finals before, this is the first time in league history two of them will square off against each other in the championship series.\nAlong with Coach of the Year Stephanie White, whose Connecticut Sun lost to Brondello's Liberty in the semifinals, the success Brondello and Hammon are enjoying coaching the WNBA's highest-profile teams is reflective of the league embracing former players as coaches. After never  having more than three head-coaching spots held by former players, they've made up half of the league's 12 jobs in each of the past two seasons.\nWith the WNBA's diversity coaching initiative dramatically increasing the number of assistant coaches with playing experience in the league, Brondello and Hammon might be the first former players to square off in the Finals. They won't be the last.\n\"Since 2019,\" WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said, \"we have tripled the number of former players who are head coaches and significantly increased those in the assistant coaching ranks.\"\nBRONDELLO AND HAMMON -- who have both already won WNBA titles as coaches, Brondello with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and Hammon last season with Las Vegas -- previously saw their careers overlap in San Antonio. Brondello was an assistant during Hammon's first three years with the Silver Stars, and then her head coach in 2010. The same person brought both of them to San Antonio: longtime WNBA head coach Dan Hughes, an advocate for former players on the sidelines.\nStarting with his first full-time coaching job in 2000 with the Cleveland Rockers, Hughes had a former WNBA player on every one of his staffs.\n\"I knew I wanted to be a basketball coach, but I also knew that I wanted my staffs to be diverse,\" Hughes told ESPN. \"I wanted them to be different than me. That was always important to me. So I needed somebody who came in as a player and then became a coach. I always needed that. I needed that kind of mentality as part of the brain trust that I was trying to create to make good decisions.\"\nWhen Hughes joined the Silver Stars in 2005 after the Rockers folded, he received a cold call from Brondello while driving to scout a UConn-Notre Dame matchup. She informed Hughes she was retiring after a lengthy playing career in both her native Australia and the WNBA, and wanted to become a coach. Although Hughes had no prior relationship with Brondello besides coaching against her, he immediately saw her as the right fit.\n\"I did everything but hire her that moment,\" Hughes recalled. \"It was just perfect. That's exactly what I wanted ...\n\"Just the way she played the game and thought the game, I thought she would make a great coach.\"\nWith Hammon, a consummate leader during her 16-season WNBA career, the question for Hughes was never whether she could coach but whether she would choose to do so rather than pursue a career in media or outside basketball.\nIn 2013, Hammon suffered an ACL tear in her first game and spent the remainder of the season watching from the sidelines. She told Hughes at season's end she wanted to coach and asked whether he could help connect her with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and the coach who would go on to be the winningest in league history.\n\"I went over the next day to Gregg Popovich,\" Hughes said. \"They were in the gym, him and [Spurs CEO] R.C. Buford. I said, 'How do you feel about Becky coming over?' 'Oh, we'd love to have her.' Pop said, 'Give her my phone number and give me a call.' That's kind of how that went down.\"\nAfter spending the 2013-14 season shadowing the Spurs coaching staff while rehabilitating her injury, Hammon was hired by the Spurs in 2014 as the first full-time, paid female assistant coach in the NBA upon her retirement from playing.\nHammon's journey led back to the WNBA before last season. After interviewing for NBA head-coaching jobs, Hammon chose to leave the San Antonio bench to become head coach of the Aces, who won the 2022 title and are now looking to become the first repeat WNBA champion since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002.\nSitting on the bench alongside Brondello, Hughes remembers feeling what he calls an \"unspoken understanding of the game\" shared with Hammon on the court.\n\"Becky and Sandy both have incredible offensive minds,\" Hughes said. \"I like putting people like that around me, to be honest with you, because I come at it defensively. That's my starting point. Players, a lot of times, are like that. There were times -- and Becky wouldn't necessarily have been privy to some of these, because she was on the floor -- Sandy would interpret what Becky was going to do to me on the bench before Becky did it.\"\nBecky Hammon's Las Vegas Aces and Sandy Brondello's New York Liberty dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, the teams ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nHughes, who retired from the WNBA in 2021 ranked fifth all time in coaching wins, texted with both coaches after they advanced to the Finals. He's hoping to attend Game 3 in New York, but will be torn, knowing how both coaches might feel at series' end.\n\"Mostly I'm excited for both these coaches,\" Hughes said, \"but I know the reality that one of them is going to attain an incredible moment and another one is going to have a pretty incredible loss.\"\nINEVITABLY, THE WNBA needed time to build up enough longevity for former players to go into the coaching ranks. Though a pair of superstar players retired and were immediately made head coaches in the league's early days -- with Nancy Lieberman taking over the expansion Detroit Shock in the WNBA's second season (1998) and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke coaching the Phoenix Mercury in 2001 after winning Finals MVP in each of the league's first four years -- they were outliers.\nIt wasn't until 2009, the WNBA's 13th year of existence, that former players coached against each other in a regular-season game when Jenny Boucek's Sacramento Monarchs faced Jennifer Gillom's Minnesota Lynx.\nWhen WNBA teams sought professional playing experience in the league's first decade, they often turned instead to former NBA players. Five of the league's 13 coaches to start the 2004 campaign were NBA veterans after Bill Laimbeer's Detroit Shock beat Michael Cooper's Los Angeles Sparks in the 2003 Finals.\nAs the WNBA has matured, more players, like Brondello and Hammon, have had opportunities to play full careers before moving to the sidelines, first as assistants (Hammon getting that experience in the NBA) and later as head coaches. In 2015, Brondello and White were joined by Boucek to give the WNBA a record three former players on the sidelines.\nBy 2020, however, that trend seemed to be heading the wrong direction. After Katie Smith was fired by New York, Brondello was left as the league's only former player serving as head coach. At that point, as the NBA was also seeing decreasing numbers of head coaches with playing experience, the WNBA made a subtle but important rules change.\nAs reported in March 2020 by Erica Ayala at The Athletic, the league increased the limit on assistant coaches from two to three for teams that have at least one former WNBA player as either an assistant or head coach.\nBecause teams would prefer to have larger coaching staffs, they quickly responded by hiring more former WNBA players. In 2019, seven of the league's 12 teams had a former player on staff. By 2021, that was 11 of 12, and this year, for the first time, every team has one. The total number of assistant coaches with playing experience has skyrocketed from nine in 2019 to 22 this season.\n\"This is about a pipeline of your future leaders so that the next time we have a coaching role or a general manager role or a team president role, that you have a very diverse pool to pick from,\" Engelbert said in 2021. \"So that's what our diversity initiatives are working on -- building experience, building capability so the next person up will get a job when there's an opening. You have to do that sometimes three years before the opening comes for that person to be ready now.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nWhen Hughes retired, former player Noelle Quinn was elevated to replace him with the Seattle Storm. Starting with her promotion, hiring former players as head coaches became a trend. All four coaching vacancies after the 2021 season went to players with WNBA experience. Three -- Brondello, Hammon and Vanessa Nygaard with the Phoenix Mercury -- either played or coached for Hughes.\n\"I wanted the landscape, like it is now, to be reflective of former players,\" he said. \"Women who are sitting in that head-coaching position. That was important to me.\"\nIt's also notable that, after Derek Fisher was fired by the Sparks in June 2022, this was the first season since 1998 in which no former NBA player served as a WNBA head coach.\nAs compared to the NBA, the WNBA is a little behind schedule for having two former players meet as coaches in the Finals. That first happened in what the NBA considers its 20th season of existence, 1967, when Alex Hannum's Philadelphia 76ers beat Bill Sharman's San Francisco Warriors. We're also still nowhere near the peak of former players as head coaches in the NBA, which came when 22 of 27 (81.5%) to start the 1993-94 season had playing experience.\nHaving Brondello and Hammon lead their talented teams to the Finals is sure to create more opportunities for the increasing number of assistant coaches like them who have followed a typical path from playing to coaching.\n\"I think what we're starting to see,\" recently retired WNBA star Sue Bird said when Quinn was introduced as head coach in 2021, \"is the WNBA was almost too young 15 years ago to have these players with these long, successful careers where they've played in the WNBA, they've played for multiple coaches, they've played overseas, maybe they've had national team experiences, whatever the case may be. With that is just a ball of knowledge and a wealth of experience.\n\"And now we're finally starting to see those coaches become assistant coaches, become head coaches. That's the path that we've all kind of been waiting for someone to start to forge that path and now we're starting to see it. [Quinn's] just another example of that. I think it's amazing. I think we're going to see more of it. I have zero doubt about that.\""}
{"title": "Predictions: Can Aces repeat or will Liberty win first title?", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:47", "text": "Seven of 18 WNBA Finals have gone the distance since the best-of-five format started in 2005. With the top two seeds and preseason favorites playing for the 2023 WNBA championship, will we see an eighth rendition of a winner-take-all Game 5 when the Las Vegas Aces face the New York Liberty?\nWe couldn't ask for a better setup, with a matchup of superstars in their primes -- Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson and New York's Breanna Stewart -- as two teams with the top talent and what appears to be the best chemistry meet. The Finals will begin Sunday in Las Vegas at 3 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN App.\nThe most recent five-game WNBA Finals was in 2019, when the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun. That was a matchup of the top two teams in the standings, as was the case in 2016 and 2017, when the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx went the distance and alternated in taking home the trophy.\nThis season, the Liberty beat the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup final, while the teams split their four regular-season meetings. They played four times in August, so those games are still fresh in their minds.\nAlmost anywhere you look in this series, you'll see a No. 1 pick or an MVP or a statistical leader -- or someone who is all three.\nBoth coaches are former WNBA players; Las Vegas' Becky Hammon led the Aces to the league title last year, while New York's Sandy Brondello guided the Phoenix Mercury to the 2014 championship.\nThe fan bases come at this from a different perspective. The Aces' franchise dates to the start of the WNBA in 1997 as the Utah Starzz, but their time in Las Vegas has been short and successful. They moved from San Antonio to the Strip in 2018, and they are appearing in the Finals for the third time.\nNew York, on the other hand, is the only still-existing original WNBA franchise that has not won a title. While the Liberty players -- none of whom has been with the team since before 2019 -- might not really feel that historical weight, the longtime Liberty fans do.\nSo which superteam will be the 2023 champion? ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel preview the Finals.\nVoepel: Stewart's shooting woes have been a surprise. She was at 46.5% overall and 35.5% from behind the arc in the regular season. In the Liberty's six playoff games, those percentages have dropped to 35.6 and 20.7. Of course, if she got a lot of her misses out of the way before the Finals, that's good news for the Liberty.\nPhilippou: Having covered the Liberty-Sun series in person, New York seemed to develop grit in real time to overcome a 0-1 deficit versus an uber-tough Connecticut squad and win three straight games, including two at Mohegan Sun Arena. Different people stepped up in different moments for the Liberty, but for the most part, they stayed poised to close out such a competitive series in four games.\nI am surprised the Liberty's bench hasn't seen more minutes in the playoffs, since their depth seemed to be an advantage when considering New York as a contender earlier this season. Does that change against the Aces? Kayla Thornton's toughness and energy can turn around a game, as can Marine Johannes' shooting, and Stefanie Dolson adds post depth against a team that doesn't have a ton of it. Johannes had a stellar outing versus the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup championship, but she has played only 42 minutes this postseason.\nPelton: In addition to seconding what Alexa said, I agree Stewart's postseason slump has been a surprise. When the Seattle Storm lost to Las Vegas in last year's semifinals, it was the first time a healthy Stewart had been knocked out of the playoffs since 2017. And even then, Stewart set a playoff record with 42 points in the final game of a hard-fought series. Going back to UConn, and including EuroLeague competition, Stewart has almost always been at her best when the stakes are the highest. They don't come much higher than in this series.\nPhilippou: Yes, the Finals are a whole new series, but those games -- particularly the August ones -- showed us a lot about how these teams match up. That said, I expect Wilson to play closer to how she did Aug. 28 against the Liberty (23 points) than say how she fared Aug. 6, when she tallied nine points on 2-for-14 shooting and tweeted, \"I doubt I'll ever shoot 2-14 again I pray I don't lol.\" Since then, she has shot below 40% just once, and she has been playing on another level over the past two months or so. The Liberty have excellent defenders in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, but they'll still have their hands full trying to slow down Wilson.\nVoepel: The Aces' 98-81 victory over the Liberty on June 29 doesn't have much bearing on this series, as Candace Parker was still playing for the Aces, and Jones wasn't quite in the playing form she is now. The other four matchups, all in August, are likely indicative of what we will see in the Finals. The Aces didn't play well in their first game in Brooklyn nor in the Commissioner's Cup final in Las Vegas. Those will be games the Aces will review in preparation because they were far from their best in both.\nThe Aces and Liberty split their regular-season series, but New York beat Las Vegas in their Aug. 15 Commissioner's Cup championship game, which doesn't count toward WNBA standings or statistics. While the Aces are 2-3 against New York, they went 37-4 against the rest of the league, and only the Liberty had multiple wins against Las Vegas, per ESPN Stats & Information.\nPelton: It's interesting that head-to-head results haven't been particularly predictive of Finals results. Since the WNBA went to a single playoff table in 2016, and not including the shortened 2020 Wubble season, teams that won the regular-season series have gone just 2-4 in the Finals. And both of those winners, the 2018 Storm and last year's Aces, also had home-court advantage in the Finals. However, we've never seen teams play each other this often before the Finals. All of those previous head-to-head series were three games rather than the five times Las Vegas and New York have already met this year.\nPelton: Given the firepower on both sides, I think it's more about which team can consistently get stops. New York was 15-0 in the regular season (and 1-0 so far in the playoffs) when holding opponents to 95 points per 100 possessions or fewer. One of those games was the Aug. 6 blowout win over Las Vegas that represented the Aces' worst offensive performance of the season in terms of points per possession -- and the Liberty's best on defense.\nPhilippou: Defensively, for the reasons Pelton stated, but also because if you ask both Hammon and Brondello, they'd say defense wins championships. Not just by the pure nature of getting stops and keeping an opponent off the scoreboard, but for these two teams in particular, defense (and defensive rebounding) fuels offense on the other end, especially in transition.\nThe Aces have had the best defensive rating in both the regular season and playoffs, but they allowed the Liberty to score at least 80 points in all of their previous meetings except one -- Aug. 17, the only time Las Vegas beat New York in their four matchups that month.\nTop-seeded Las Vegas and No. 2 seed New York dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, they ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nVoepel: The Aces have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Wilson, but she has given much praise to Kiah Stokes as the true anchor of Las Vegas' defense. The Aces' Jackie Young is one of the league's best defensive guards and at 6 feet tall actually can take on just about anyone. Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark is also a versatile defender.\nIt makes sense to say defense will prevail in this series, for all the reasons Alexa and Kevin point out. Still, let's add this: The Aces can be like a runaway train on offense, and that can take over games. The Aces won playoff games scoring 97 points and 64 points, which shows how effective they can be on both ends of the court.\nPhilippou: Jones' emergence into her MVP-level self is arguably the single biggest development that has catapulted this Liberty team into a contender. In the postseason, she has had six double-doubles in as many games; and in the second half alone of Game 4 in the semifinals, Jones came up with 20 points and eight rebounds.\nGoing up against the Mystics' and Sun's frontcourts is different than facing that of the Aces' (especially with Wilson being unstoppable as of late). But if Jones can play like she did in New York's August meetings versus Las Vegas, the Liberty are much better positioned to win.\nAnother X factor is Liberty forward Betnijah Laney, who has scored at least 19 points in all but one of New York's postseason games and will be critical to helping contain the Aces' high-powered guards.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nVoepel: Jones is the biggest X factor overall in the series. The biggest for Las Vegas is Kelsey Plum's 3-point shooting, because that can really fuel the Aces. Plum averaged 2.4 3s per game and shot 38.9% from behind the arc in the regular season; during the Aces' five playoff games, she was at 3.2 and 42.1%. Plum, Young and Chelsea Gray all can do damage from long range, but if Plum gets in a groove, it makes Las Vegas' offense all the harder to stop.\nPelton: Stokes. Over the course of the season, as well as the playoffs, the Aces' starting lineup with Stokes in place of the injured Parker -- the group that led Las Vegas to last year's title -- has remained dominant.\nHowever, that hasn't been the case against the Liberty. In 45 minutes across the five meetings, the Aces were outscored by 19 points with their starting five on the court. Although Hammon can always go small with Clark in Stokes' place, not being able to keep Stokes on the court will leave Las Vegas painfully thin.\nPhilippou: Liberty in 5. I went back and forth and wouldn't be shocked to be proved wrong. But at the end of the day, it's hard to ignore how much the Liberty dominated the Aces in their most recent meetings in August. Plus, New York had a much tougher road to the championship series, and being battle-tested will pay off. Jones won MVP of the Commissioner's Cup championship game thanks to her dominance in the paint on both ends and on the glass, and I project her to take home Finals MVP should the Liberty win.\nVoepel: Aces in 5. This feels like the 2016 and 2017 Lynx-Sparks Finals, when there was such a good case for both teams to win both years. They split, with the Sparks winning in 2016 and the Lynx in 2017. The Sparks won 2016's Game 5 on Minnesota's home court, which is so hard to do in the clinching game of a playoff series. Then the Lynx won in Minneapolis in 2017's Game 5 -- although at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena, because Target Center was being refurbished. The WNBA's most recent Finals Game 5 was in 2019, when Washington beat Connecticut on the Mystics' home court.\nIt seems like this year, the Aces -- who celebrated their 2022 title in Connecticut -- might win it at home.\nPelton: Liberty in 4. That's not a reflection on how close the series might be, but lower-seeded teams that have won the Finals in the best-of-five era have been more likely to close out at home than win a Game 5 on the road. If Parker were healthy, I'd be inclined to pick Las Vegas. But New York has been the (slightly) better team since the All-Star break, and I don't expect Stewart's shooting slump to carry over into the Finals.\nRamona Shelburne: Aces in 5. Las Vegas misses Parker, and this matchup is going to be difficult. But the Aces are the defending champs until someone takes the title from them. You've got to knock them off, and that's difficult over a best-of-five series."}

And you'd be wrong on Alabama. But you get the point.\nWho in the world thought Louisville, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and Washington State all would be unbeaten now? Sure, maybe one or two because of the early-season schedule. But not all the wins were expected -- who thought Kentucky would wallop Florida?\nThose teams put their perfect records on the line in Week 6, which features the biggest battle of 5-0 teams with No. 12 Oklahoma facing No. 3 Texas in Saturday's Red River Rivalry.\nOur reporters preview Week 6 with a look at the surprising undefeated teams and quarterback matchups to watch, plus some of the week's best quotes.\nLouisville: When Louisville hired native son Jeff Brohm, you could feel the excitement build not only among the fan base but among the football program. He then overhauled the roster and brought in several key transfers who have paid off in big ways, starting with quarterback Jack Plummer, who played for him at Purdue. Plummer ranks No. 3 in the ACC in passing, no surprise considering Brohm's background and history, and transfer Jamari Thrash ranks No. 2 in the league in receiving. Perhaps the biggest revelation has been the Cardinals' rushing offense behind Jawhar Jordan, who leads the league with 510 yards and six touchdowns. Defensively, transfers Devin Neal (Baylor) and Cam'Ron Kelly (UNC), tied for second on the team with 24 tackles, have been big additions, too. But returner Ashton Gillotte has taken the next step with five sacks.\nBrohm described his team's 13-10 win over NC State last week as his defense's best performance of the season. But it will take a complete team effort to beat Notre Dame and end the Irish's 30-game regular-season winning streak against the ACC.\n\"We've done just enough to win five games,\" Brohm told ESPN. \"And we've shown some toughness and some grit to come back and win a few, so that's been really good to see, our guys play that hard. To this point, everything's been good. I know as a coach that our schedule will just continue to get tougher and tougher, and we're going to have challenges ahead, starting this week.\" -- Andrea Adelson\nMaryland: Winners of its first five games in a season for the first time since Ralph Friedgen coached the program to the ACC title in 2001, Maryland heads into a major spotlight Saturday when it visits the Horseshoe to tangle with No. 4 Ohio State. Taulia Tagovailoa spearheads a Terrapins offense that leads the Big Ten in total offense (454.8 YPG) while sitting behind only Penn State in scoring offense (38.6 PPG). Tagovailoa, who tops the conference with both 1,464 passing yards and 13 touchdown passes, has three games of at least three touchdown tosses, led by last week's 352-yard, five-touchdown effort in a 44-17 dispatching of Indiana. Led by Jeshaun Jones' 19 receptions, six receivers have caught at least 11 passes and eight players have found the end zone, as Tagovailoa has done a stellar job of spreading the wealth and not letting opposing defenses key on one player. Defensively, Brian Williams' unit has forced 10 turnovers combined over the past three weeks in convincing victories over Virginia, Michigan State and Indiana. It faces its stiffest challenge yet with a Buckeyes offense itching to sustain momentum from their win in South Bend on Sept. 23. -- Blake Baumgartner\nKentucky: The schedule has been more than manageable, and even the most blue-hearted Kentucky fan would acknowledge as much. Three of the Wildcats' wins have come over teams (Ball State, Akron and Vanderbilt) with a combined 4-12 record, and a fourth win came over FCS foe Eastern Kentucky. That's not to diminish the fact the Wildcats are doing the things it takes to win at a high level, in particular running the ball, stopping the run, eliminating explosive plays and forcing turnovers. They're averaging 6.48 yards per rush (second nationally) and limiting opponents to 2.54 yards per rush (eighth nationally). Ray Davis, a transfer from Vanderbilt, rushed for 280 yards last week in the 33-14 win over Florida, the most rushing yards by an FBS player this season. Kentucky dominated the line of scrimmage, as quarterback Devin Leary attempted just 19 passes, completing nine for 69 yards. He's a better passer than he's shown to this point and will have to make more plays down the field in the passing game if the Wildcats are going to keep it going, and that starts Saturday against No. 1 Georgia. Leary's top two receiving targets, Tayvion Robinson and Barion Brown, left the Florida game in the second half with injuries. Their status is up in the air. Some younger receivers may need to step up, but the Wildcats are going to need more out of their passing game as they tackle an October stretch that includes Georgia on the road and then Missouri and Tennessee at home. -- Chris Low\nMissouri: The short version for why Mizzou is 5-0 is simple: Brady Cook to Luther Burden III. But here's the longer version. The Tigers began the season with wins over South Dakota and MTSU, but the offense disappointed terribly in the process. The Tigers averaged 4.9 yards per play against MTSU, worse than Murray State (5.7) and everyone else on the Blue Raiders' schedule, and a couple of fourth-and-short punts both revealed Eliah Drinkwitz's general lack of confidence and nearly proved costly in the 23-19 win. But the frustration emanating from that evidently lit a fire. The Tigers scored at least 30 points in wins over Kansas State, Memphis and Vanderbilt -- all teams better than MTSU -- in recent weeks. And Cook has been one of the best QBs in the country in the process, averaging 364 passing yards per game with eight TDs. He's set an SEC record for consecutive passes without an interception, and he's thriving both because of Burden, the nation's leading receiver, and because other targets like Theo Wease (118 yards vs. Vanderbilt) have begun to thrive. The Tigers' defense is still a top-30 or so unit, and suddenly the offense is dynamite. And now they return home to host an LSU team that is equal parts dangerous and flawed. -- Bill Connelly\nWashington State: With half the Pac-12 ranked in the top 18 of the AP poll, the Cougars remain under the radar despite climbing from unranked to No. 13. Yet, when laying out the best wins by Pac-12 teams, it's the Cougars -- Wisconsin, Oregon State -- who stand out. Both of those win margins were by single digits, but WSU controlled both games and has impressed on both sides of the ball. There is a lot of credit to spread around, but it begins with quarterback Cam Ward. In new offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle's offense, Ward has made significant strides to become one of the best quarterbacks in the country. He's accurate, he makes good decisions, and he's playing with a general sense of calm that evaded him at times last year. Plus, the additions of Josh Kelly and Kyle Williams at receiver have given him a deep, talent group of receivers, joining Lincoln Victor. This is a team without a major problem area, which makes it a tough out each week. -- Kyle Bonagura\nSam Hartman (Notre Dame) vs. Jack Plummer (Louisville)\nIt might be easy to pick Plummer based on what happened last season alone. Hartman, playing for Wake Forest, had the worst game of his career at Louisville -- throwing three interceptions, losing three fumbles and taking seven sacks in a 48-21 loss. He was benched to start the fourth quarter in a game Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson called a \"disaster.\" But Hartman is in a different spot now with the Irish -- and a different offense that is not asking him to put as much on his shoulders as he did at Wake. His late-game heroics last week against Duke led Notre Dame to a 21-14 comeback victory. Meanwhile, Plummer faced all sorts of pressure from the NC State defense a week ago and did not play his best game, throwing two interceptions and getting sacked four times. Expect Notre Dame to bring the same type of pressure as NC State did, and Hartman to have a much better performance than a year ago. -- Adelson\nQuinn Ewers (Texas) vs. Dillon Gabriel (Oklahoma)\nGabriel notably missed this game last year due to a concussion, leading to disaster for Oklahoma. Five different players attempted a pass, including two running backs and a punter, as the Sooners managed just 39 passing yards in a historic 49-0 blowout loss, the worst in any game in school history. But this season, he's leading the Big 12 in QBR, with Ewers second. Gabriel is third nationally with eight completions of 40 or more yards, while Ewers has been inconsistent on deep balls, though he's improved in that area. Both defenses have taken huge steps this season, but Gabriel has been more consistent and will be asked to do more. In what could end up as another Texas-OU shootout, Gabriel likely will have the better numbers. -- Dave Wilson\nTaulia Tagovailoa (Maryland) vs. Kyle McCord (Ohio State) \nMcCord finished the Notre Dame game on an encouraging note, but Tagovailoa had five touchdown passes last week and eight in his first two Big Ten games. Maryland's receiving corps doesn't generate the attention Ohio State's does, but there's real depth with Tai Felton and West Virginia transfer Kaden Prather emerging alongside Jeshaun Jones. \"Very similar to when I was at Alabama, I had [Henry] Ruggs and [Jerry] Jeudy] and [Jaylen] Waddle and Smitty [DeVonta Smith],\" Terrapins coach Mike Locksley told me. \"Your offense is more dynamic when the ball is spread around.\" -- Adam Rittenberg\nDevin Leary (Kentucky) vs. Carson Beck (Georgia)\nLeary, who passed for 6,807 yards during his career at NC State, is due for a breakout game. He's thrown 10 touchdown passes and five interceptions in his first five outings for Kentucky, which really hasn't needed to throw the ball much. The Wildcats could be short-handed at receiver with Tayvion Robinson and Barion Brown both being banged up, and that won't help matters against a Georgia defense that has already intercepted eight passes and is tied for third nationally in allowing just 4.8 yards per pass attempt. Carson Beck, in his first season as Georgia's starter, is completing 72 percent of his passes and averaging right at 300 passing yards per game. The Bulldogs got star tight end Brock Bowers going in the win over Auburn last week, and that's a connection that gives Beck (and any quarterback) the edge. -- Low\nBilly Napier: The Florida coach was blunt when it came to assessing his team's 33-14 drubbing by Kentucky.\n\"There is no sugarcoating this thing. We have no excuse. We can coach better and we can play better. Hopefully, we will do that.\"\nDeion Sanders: There's no question that celebrity has surrounded the Buffaloes, and the coach was more than happy to help Snoop Dogg deliver a message to Omarion Miller, who caught seven passes for 196 yards in Colorado's Week 5 loss to USC.\n\"A dear friend called me and summoned me to get him on the phone to FaceTime. [He] wanted to talk to him and wanted to let him know that he has a tremendous gift. I don't know what the conversation was, but I know I just handed him the phone. I said, 'Somebody wants to talk to you.' He looked at the phone like, 'Oh my god.' Yeah, it was Snoop. Snoop wanted to talk to [Miller]. He wanted to challenge him.\"\nDave Clawson: The Wake Forest coach, whose team plays at Clemson on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ET, ACC Network), hasn't forgotten last year's 2OT loss to the Tigers.\n\"There are certain games in your career you never, ever get over. That's one of them. When I'm on my deathbed, that game will still bother me. Hopefully, our players feel the same way.\""}
{"title": "Gio Reyna's USMNT return raises questions for Gregg Berhalter -- on and off the field", "date": "2023-10-05 23:47:12", "text": "The rapprochement between U.S. men's national team manager Gregg Berhalter and talented attacker Gio Reyna has finally taken place.\nNow what?\nReyna is included in the latest U.S. roster, which was announced on Thursday for games against Germany on Oct. 14 and Ghana three days later. The matches will mark Reyna's first action with the USMNT since fracturing his right leg in the Concacaf Nations League final against Canada last June.\nMore critically, Reyna and Berhalter will be working together for the first time since the 2022 World Cup, when tensions between the pair led to the families of both men being engulfed by a very public feud.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nThere are still plenty of questions about what the future holds for Reyna at international level. Foremost among these is the extent to which Reyna and Berhalter's relationship is really mended.\nThere was a roughly eight-month period in which the two didn't talk following a maelstrom of incidents that stemmed from Reyna's limited playing time at the 2022 World Cup. Berhalter afterward contributed to the subsequent outing of Reyna's poor attitude, and in response Reyna's family told U.S. Soccer officials about a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter.\nSuffice it to say, there was considerable healing that needed to take place.\nOn a conference call with reporters after Thursday's roster announcement, Berhalter confirmed that the first step took place \"weeks ago\" with the two conversing over a Zoom call. He didn't provide much in the way of details beyond that, except for saying that he and Reyna are in a \"good spot\" and that it was a \"positive conversation.\"\nBerhalter did acknowledge that the process of mending the relationship is ongoing.\n\"I think it will take time,\" Berhalter said. \"It is a difference between a Zoom call and being in person. But I think that both intentions are positive, and the idea is that we work together for the team to be successful, and I think we're both prepared to do that.\"\nTime will reveal the extent to which that actually happens. There are ups and downs in any coach-player relationship, and what took place over those eight months isn't just going to wash away.\nBut the two have to begin somewhere, and the upcoming camp is the place to start. Reyna's return to the national team camp raises its own set of on-field questions, though.\nReyna hasn't played for club or country since sustaining the aforementioned right leg fracture. He has been healthy enough to be on the bench for Borussia Dortmund of late, so how much could he see the field for the U.S. team?\nBerhalter indicated his approach to using Reyna in the upcoming games will be similar to his handling of Folarin Balogun during the September window. On that occasion, with Balogun working his way back to full fitness following his move to AS Monaco, Berhalter limited the forward to 45-minute stints against Uzbekistan and Oman.\nHerc Gomez reacts to U.S. soccer sporting director Matt Crocker saying there's \"a way forward\" for Gio Reyna and Gregg Berhalter.\nBerhalter said on Thursday that his goal is to build up Reyna's fitness \"in a safe way\" and send him back to Dortmund in a position to make a greater impact for his club.\n\"We're going to be creative with the minutes,\" Berhalter said in relation to Reyna. \"We want to certainly get him on the field and work through both the Germany game, and seeing what position he plays. And then in the Ghana game, same thing, seeing how we can get him in different positions throughout the camp on the field.\"\nWhere Reyna is deployed may just be the biggest question of all. During the 2022 cycle, Reyna played almost exclusively on the wing. But against better teams, the U.S. has struggled to create chances on a consistent basis and, in response, Berhalter could look at putting the creative Reyna in a position to get on the ball more.\nAt the 2022 World Cup -- in which Reyna played a mere 52 minutes due in part to disciplinary issues -- the USMNT's xG, or expected goals, per 90 minutes of actual playing time (which includes stoppage time) was 0.91. That xG, which measures chance creation, ranked 22nd in the tournament among all 32 teams, and 12th out of the 16 teams that reached the knockout stages. Yes, that's a small sample size, but it still points to how the U.S. could use more creativity.\nOne possible solution was on display last June, when the USMNT, under interim manager B.J. Callaghan, trotted out a 4-2-3-1 with Reyna in a central attacking role. Against World Cup qualifiers Mexico and Canada, the U.S. attack looked much more fluid and the attack also benefited from Reyna handling set piece duties.\nHerculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nBerhalter didn't rule out Reyna reprising that central attacking role, but he didn't completely commit to it either.\n\"In terms of Gio, we see him being able to play three positions: center midfielder, attacking midfielder and winger,\" Berhalter said. \"And we use wingers in different ways. Sometimes the wingers are wide against the line, and sometimes they're in between the lines, and we see him as more of an in-between-the-lines winger.\"\nThe continued absence of defensive midfielder Tyler Adams due to a hamstring injury means the U.S. manager has some other questions about his midfield to solve. Does he play with a single holding midfielder or resort to a double pivot? But in the past, Berhalter has lauded how the midfield trio of Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie played together, hinting that he would continue with that group if all were healthy.\nDuring the Nations League, Callaghan noted that Reyna's ability to defend is an area where the U.S. coaching staff have asked for improvement, and the 20-year-old responded well to that challenge. If that continues to be the case, the benefits of playing Reyna centrally seem to outweigh his defensive shortcomings, especially if he has two out of Musah, McKennie and (hopefully) Adams playing behind him. It seems the time has arrived to gather more data about Reyna's ability to operate in that midfield role.\nEither way, the games against Germany and Ghana will certainly provide a stern test to see if the U.S. attack -- as well as Berhalter and Reyna -- can move forward."}

(1:17)\nThe summer transfer window has closed throughout most of Europe, but there are still moves in the works and plenty of gossip swirling around. Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!\nLionel Messi could make a sensational return to Barcelona in the January transfer window, if Inter Miami don't make the Eastern Conference playoffs.\nThat's according to Spanish outlet AS, which has suggested that the 36-year-old World Cup-winner could head back to Spotify Camp Nou in January on loan for a proper send-off at the club where he spent 17 years.\nMessi has been keen to return to Camp Nou since his departure to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. Before his move to Inter Miami, Messi admitted he had been in discussions with his former club in Spain, but financial restrictions made a move too complicated.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nInter Miami are currently seven spots adrift of playoffs line in the standings with only three matches left, though they have at least one game in hand over the teams they need to leapfrog up the table. The MLS regular season ends on Oct. 21, at which point Messi's season would be over if Miami miss playoffs.\nMoreover, Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas even hinted that he wouldn't stand in the Argentine World Cup winner's way if there was a possibility Messi could seal his dream return to Spain.\nThe Argentine skipper is contracted to Miami until 2025 but he has already stated he has no interest in extending his stay in the MLS beyond that date, per reports. Messi has also recently been linked with a move to his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys when his stay in the U.S. ends.\n- Manchester City hope to fend off interest from Real Madrid in star striker Erling Haaland by holding contract talks soon, according to The Telegraph. Haaland has scored eight goals in 10 games this season after scoring 52 last time around, which is why City are hoping to extend his contract. Reports of Real Madrid's interest in the 23-year-old have been persistent, but it won't be an easy sell -- he is playing for the current European champions and is in excellent form. Los Blancos were hoping to sign one of Kylian Mbappé or Haaland in 2024, and for now neither move seems likely.\n- Newcastle United are preparing to battle it out with Liverpool and Juventus for Nice midfielder Khephren Thuram, according to Tuttomercatoweb. The 22-year-old central midfielder has been in sensational form for the fourth-place side and number of top clubs take interest. Thuram is contracted to the club until 2025 but could be available for around €40 million. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund are also interested.\n- Juventus continue to scour the market for rising stars, and the latest name linked with the Italian club is Shakhtar Donetsk's Georgiy Sudakov, per Tuttosport. The Bianconeri have been monitoring the 21-year-old midfielder for the last two seasons, and believe he has the attacking capabilities to offer them something different. Sudakov is seen as a possible target for the January transfer window, and Juve scouts went to Belgium to watch him in Champions League action against Royal Antwerp on Wednesday, where he starred in the No. 10 role in a 3-2 victory.\n- Michael Kayode has seized his opportunity at Fiorentina this season following an cruciate ligament injury to teammate Dodô, attracting the interest of Arsenal, according to Calciomercato. The 19-year-old, who three years ago was playing in Serie D, has impressed on the right flank, and his efforts have prompted Fiorentina officials to try and extend his contract beyond its current end date in 2025. Arsenal have been monitoring his progress since first watching him at the U-19 European Championship, in which he scored the winning goal in the final.\n- Nico Williams has been a man in demand since the summer, but he could disappoint any potential suitors by extending his contract at current club Athletic Club Bilbao, per Sport. Both Real Madrid and Barcelona are reportedly on the verge of conceding defeat in their pursuit of the 21-year-old winger. Williams' current deal is set to finish at the end of this season, but Bilbao are confident he'll extend his contract before the end of the year."}
{"title": "What to know about the Warriors' WNBA expansion franchise", "date": "2023-10-06 00:46:22", "text": "Ramona Shelburne and Malika Andrews react to the Bay Area receiving a WNBA expansion team. (1:05)\nWNBA fans have long clamored for expansion, and that day is finally here: The league will add a 13th team in the Bay Area, awarded to the NBA's Golden State Warriors, that will begin play in 2025, the WNBA announced Thursday.\nA second expansion franchise is expected to be announced this year, likely Portland, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. That franchise would also begin play in 2025. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert confirmed in a news conference Thursday the league's goal is to have 14 teams by 2025.\nEngelbert and Warriors personnel declined to reveal the expansion fee the Warriors paid. Engelbert added only that it was \"a record-breaking expansion fee\" for the league, along with other significant investments that come with starting a WNBA franchise.\nThe league, which had as many as 16 teams in 2000, has held steady at 12 teams since 2010, after the Sacramento Monarchs folded the previous year. It last had 14 teams in 2008, when both the Monarchs and Houston Comets were still playing.\nThe long-awaited news of expansion won't just open up more roster spots -- which currently is at a maximum of 144, or 12 per team -- but will also reestablish the WNBA in at least one market where the league has already been: The Monarchs were an original franchise and played in Sacramento from 1997 to 2009, winning a championship in 2005. The Portland Fire were added in 2000 before the franchise folded in 2002.\nThe new team -- which will likely be called \"Golden State\" per Shelburne, though its official name and mascot are still to be determined -- will play home games at the Chase Center in San Francisco (where the Warriors play) and will practice in Oakland at the Warriors' former practice facility.\nThe Warriors are the sixth NBA franchise with a WNBA team, joining the Indiana Pacers (Indiana Fever), Minnesota Timberwolves (Minnesota Lynx), Brooklyn Nets (New York Liberty), Phoenix Suns (Phoenix Mercury) and Washington Wizards (Washington Mystics).\nGolden State also expands the league's footprint out West, giving the WNBA five teams in the Pacific or Mountain time zones.\nESPN's Alexa Philippou, Michael Voepel and Kevin Pelton break down what we know and what we are still waiting to find out about the new Golden State WNBA team and the league's expansion plans.\nWarriors personnel and Engelbert pointed to signs that women's basketball and women's sports in general are taking off. On Thursday they mentioned how viewership, attendance and merchandise sales are all going in the right direction, as well as increased sponsorship interest even within the past five to 10 years. To put it simply: \"The league is ready,\" said Joe Lacob, Warrior co-executive chairman and CEO.\nWhile the WNBA sat on expansion for over a decade, the NWSL (which began competition in 2013) has showcased the surging interest and investment in women's sports, as the league has expanded from eight to 12 teams since 2021 and has three more to come, including one in the Bay Area.\nThe inability of promising yet developing players, or even already established talented veterans, to maintain roster spots in the league has led to calls for the WNBA to expand its size, which could be done either via franchise expansion or by increasing the number of players teams are permitted to carry. WNBA stakeholders have different opinions on which route would be best, but Engelbert has maintained she believes franchise expansion is the way to go.\n\"The depth of the talent in this league has never been better, and the depth of the talent and breadth of the talent coming out of the NCAA system has never been better,\" Engelbert said Thursday.\nFranchise expansion will arrive amid enormous excitement over the crop of talent and high-profile players currently in college -- a group Engelbert called \"generational players\" Thursday -- with the likes of Iowa's Caitlin Clark, LSU's Angel Reese, Stanford's Cameron Brink, UConn's Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd and Notre Dame's Olivia Miles expected to go pro over the next few years.\nThe 2025 calendar year will be pivotal for the league even beyond expansion. While the current CBA runs through 2027, there is a mutual opt-out clause that could go into effect at the end of the 2025 campaign. The league's media rights deal with ESPN also runs through 2025. Engelbert has previously identified the new rights deal -- and as part of that the league's valuation -- as critical to the league's growth, and has said that expansion can help boost the league's value ahead of those negotiations. -- Philippou\nEngelbert said Thursday that details on how Golden State will build its roster will be discussed after the WNBA Finals when both the competition committee and board of governors meet. She said an expansion draft would likely happen in late 2024, after the draft lottery for the 2025 draft is held.\nWhile we don't know exactly how the process will go, we can look to history for precedent. In 2008, the Atlanta Dream built their inaugural roster of 13 players via an expansion draft by selecting from a pool of available players from the other 13 WNBA franchises, and by conducting multiple trades. For the expansion draft, which was held in February before free agency, each team was able to protect a maximum of six players who were not eligible for selection by Atlanta. The Dream could choose one player from each team regardless of contract status, although they couldn't select multiple unrestricted free agents. Atlanta then had the right to \"core\" that unrestricted free agent -- in the Dream's case, Betty Lennox.\nThe last time an expansion draft was held for multiple incoming franchises was in 2000: the still-running Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm as well as the now-defunct Miami Sol and Portland. In that expansion draft, the rules largely preserved existing teams, allowing them to protect eight of their nine top players. The new teams selected six players in the expansion draft and filled out their rosters in the 2000 draft or via trades.\nIn 2008, the Dream were assigned the No. 4 pick and did not participate in the lottery. In 2006, the Chicago Sky were assigned the sixth pick, behind the five teams that missed the playoffs the previous season.\nAgain, these aren't necessarily the rules the league will dictate as Golden State builds its roster, but they give us an idea of what could happen. -- Philippou\nAside from the Bay Area's women's basketball tradition and roots, the region makes sense from an economic perspective. Engelbert mentioned multiple times the potential to capitalize off Silicon Valley as a \"global hub of technology and commerce and innovation.\"\n\"Technology is driving our economy, and the tech center of your country doesn't have a WNBA team -- that doesn't seem right to me,\" the commissioner said. The Bay Area is also a big media market and had favorable \"demographics and the psychographics\" for a WNBA team, she said.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nEngelbert mentioned the importance of bringing in \"long-term owners committed to success, not just to the team and winning championships but to the league overall,\" and the Warriors seem like they'll fit that bill perfectly. The fact that this Golden State team will play in a state-of-the-art arena such as the Chase Center and practice in a NBA-grade facility in Oakland shows the standard for investment in the league is light-years better than where it was even five years ago.\nThe Warriors have the expertise on how to operate a massive successful basketball franchise, and Lacob has shown a commitment to women's basketball previously with his involvement in the ABL and the San Jose Lasers. He noted that the sport is in a much different place than where it was in the late-1990s, but also said, \"I'm a lot wiser now. ... We are a little more experienced and we're certainly well-capitalized and have good facilities.\"\nMany notable WNBA players have Bay Area ties: Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray, Danielle Robinson and Haley Jones are from the region. Stanford produced sisters Nneka Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike, as well as Brink, and Layshia Clarendon went to Cal. Bay Area fans would be even more excited about their new team should it manage to get any of those local legends. -- Philippou\nIt's important to remember the Monarchs franchise didn't fold for lack of fan support. It was one of the franchises that was a victim of the global financial crisis of 2006 to '08, and the Maloof family -- which then also owned the NBA's Sacramento Kings -- got out of the WNBA.\nThere were Bay Area fans who supported the Monarchs; now they won't have as far to travel. Between the Stanford fan base, former Monarchs and Lasers fans, and cultivating new fans, this organization should be able to establish a solid following. -- Voepel\nLacob boldly said in Thursday's news conference that the Golden State team will win a championship within its first five years of existence (something he also said when he purchased the Warriors). That said, history tells us not to expect too much, too soon from an expansion team. The last two franchises added to the league won a combined nine games in their first season of play, with Chicago going 5-29 and Atlanta 4-30. But their paths diverged from there.\nThe Dream landed Angel McCoughtry by winning the 2009 draft lottery and improved by 14 wins in Year 2, making the playoffs. A year after that, Atlanta reached the WNBA Finals for the first of three trips in four years led by McCoughtry.\nMeanwhile, the Sky were still struggling to make the playoffs despite arriving in the league two years earlier. Their first postseason trip didn't come until their eighth season in 2013, when the addition of future MVP Elena Delle Donne as a rookie to another future MVP in Sylvia Fowles produced a 24-10 record.

(2:22)\nDick Butkus, arguably the fiercest Monster of the Midway, has died at age 80, the Chicago Bears announced Thursday.\nButkus became a Bears legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer in his nine-year career, which started in 1965. The middle linebacker was a vicious tackler whose intimidating presence put some players on their heels before the ball was even snapped.\nIn a statement released through the Bears, Butkus' family said he \"died peacefully in his sleep overnight\" at his home in Malibu, California.\n\"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" team chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looks for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership.\n\"He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. ... His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.\"\nDick Butkus was a legend who embodied what it means to be a Chicago Bear. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. pic.twitter.com/8UEVuuZLwi\nThe Bears took on the Commanders on Thursday night in Landover, Maryland, and a moment of silence for Butkus was held before kickoff.\nHall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones once called Butkus a \"maniac\" and \"well-conditioned animal.\" Butkus appeared to want to send a message with every tackle.\n\"I want to just let 'em know that they've been hit, and when they get up, they don't have to look to see who it was that hit 'em,\" Butkus once told NFL Films. \"It shouldn't be any puzzle. When they come to, they got to say, 'It must've been Butkus that got me.'\"\nIn a game against the rival Green Bay Packers during the 1970 season, Butkus and teammate Willie Holman hit quarterback Bart Starr so hard Starr lost his helmet and began walking toward the wrong bench.\nSaid the Chicago Tribune: \"[Starr] looked like Oscar Bonavena after Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] had finished with him.\"\nHe made the Pro Bowl in eight of his nine seasons, but a chronic knee injury abruptly ended his career in 1974 at age 31.\n\"Dick Butkus was a fierce and passionate competitor who helped define the linebacker position as one of the NFL's all-time greats,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Thursday. \"Dick's intuition, toughness and athleticism made him the model linebacker whose name will forever be linked to the position and the Chicago Bears.\n\"... We send our deepest condolences to the Butkus family, the Bears organization and the many fans and people he impacted throughout his life.\"\nButkus finished his career with 1,020 tackles and 22 interceptions. He was named first team All-Pro five times, won the George Halas Award in 1974 and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1979.\nHe also was named to the NFL's all-decade teams in the 1960s and 1970s and is a member of the league's 75th and 100th anniversary all-time teams.\nButkus spent his entire football career in Illinois. Born on Dec. 9, 1942, as the youngest of eight children, he grew up on the city's South Side as a fan of the Chicago Cardinals, the Bears' crosstown rivals. He played high school football for Chicago Vocational High School, earning a high school player of the year award as a junior.\nHe went on to compete in college at Illinois, where he played both center and linebacker. He helped the Fighting Illini to an 8-1-1 record and Rose Bowl victory in 1963. In his senior season, he made the All-America team and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting.\nThat led to Butkus being selected by the Bears with the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL draft. He had to fill the big shoes of Hall of Fame linebacker Bill George, but Butkus quickly showed he was up to the task. He set career highs with five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries during his rookie season.\nButkus would hit runners high, wrap them up and drive them to the ground like a rag doll. Sports Illustrated once called him \"The Most Feared Man in the Game.\"\nWhen the Detroit Lions unveiled an I-formation against the Bears at old Tigers Stadium, Butkus knocked every member of the \"I\" -- the center, quarterback, fullback and halfback -- out of the game.\nSaid teammate Ed O'Bradovich: \"Just to hit people wasn't good enough. He loved to crush people.\"\nA legend of the game & part of what makes the NFL's oldest rivalry so special. Sending our condolences to the family & friends of Dick Butkus & the entire @ChicagoBears organization 🙏 pic.twitter.com/dU7h8TtsWi\n\"I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately,\" Butkus once replied tongue-in-cheek when asked about his on-field reputation. \"Unless it was, you know, important... like a league game or something.\"\nButkus played for only two winning teams with the Bears, however, and never made the playoffs. He came on during the end of the George Halas era, just missing the 1963 championship season. In his final season, the Bears went 3-11.\nAfter he retired, Butkus sued the Bears for $1.6 million, contending he was provided inadequate medical care and owed the four years of salary remaining on his contract. The lawsuit was settled for $600,000, but Butkus and Halas didn't speak for five years.\nThat divide healed, however, and he became a staunch public supporter of the franchise. A year ago, he even took over the team's social media account for an evening, thrilling fans.\nThrough the Butkus Foundation, he helped establish a program at a Southern California hospital to encourage early screenings to detect heart disease. He promoted a campaign to encourage high school athletes to train and eat well and avoid performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe foundation oversees the Butkus Award, established in 1985 to honor college football's best linebacker. It was expanded in 2008 to include pros and high school players.\n\"Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch,\" McCaskey, who is Halas' grandson, said in his statement. \"His legacy and philanthropy included a mission of ridding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health.\"\nMany people knew Butkus more for his appearances in films -- such as \"The Longest Yard\" in 1974 -- and on television (\"My Two Dads\" and \"Hang Time\") after his playing days. He became a well-known pitchman in commercials. His Miller Lite commercials with Bubba Smith, in which they played off their menacing reputations, were especially well-known.\nButkus also was a sports broadcaster, even serving as a color analyst on Bears games.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame lowered its flags to half-staff in Butkus' honor.\n\"Playing in an era when middle linebacker became one of the game's glamour positions -- and several of Dick's contemporaries also would end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame -- his name most often was cited first as the epitome of what it took to excel at the highest level,\" Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement.\nButkus is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Ricky, Matt and Nikki. Nephew Luke Butkus has coached in college and the NFL, including time with the Bears.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

(0:32)\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- LSU Tigers star Angel Reese is well aware much was made about the closing moments of the women's basketball national championship game in April. LSU had sealed the program's first NCAA title, and Reese gave wrestling star John Cena's \"You can't see me\" hand motion toward Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark, then motioned to her ring finger.\nClark said after LSU's 102-85 victory in Dallas that she didn't really notice, but that she didn't think that Reese had done anything wrong. Clark said enthusiasm, emotion and even some trash-talking are a normal part of competitive sports, the same things she has done herself.\nThursday at LSU's media day, Reese shared similar sentiments. All eyes are on the Tigers -- they added top transfers Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow and are No. 1 in ESPN's preseason rankings -- and on Reese, the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. She said she is ready to move forward, but did address the hoopla from April.\n\"I love Caitlin; we've been competing since we were in AAU,\" Reese said. \"It was always fun, always competitive. One day, hopefully, we could even be teammates. She is a great player, shooter, person and teammate.\n\"The world is always going to have a good girl and a bad girl. I'll take that I'm going to be the bad guy because I know I've grown women's basketball and inspired people.\"\nReese laughed when it was pointed out that \"good vs. bad\" just depended on which team fans were rooting for.\n\"Yeah, LSU loves me, but they might not like her. People can think what they think,\" Reese said. \"Me and Caitlin are cool; we've never had any issues. Just knowing I've helped grow women's basketball, and she has, too, that's all that matters.\"\nReese also spoke of the news that the WNBA announced an expansion team Thursday, and how much she wants to play in the pro league and for the U.S. senior national team someday. Like Clark, Reese is a senior but could return for a fifth college season in 2024-25 because of the COVID-19 waiver.\nReese said she isn't thinking much now about whether she will enter the 2024 or 2025 WNBA draft. She said she will talk with her family, advisers and LSU coach Kim Mulkey about that when this college season ends -- which Reese hopes will be with another NCAA title.\nThe 6-foot-3 forward averaged 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds last season, had 34 double-doubles and has worked on her shooting range in the offseason. Morrow, a 6-1 junior forward who transferred from the DePaul Blue Demons, averaged 25.7 points and 12.2 rebounds last season. Both are eager to team up in dominating the paint this season for LSU.\n\"Angel is a competitor; I wanted to be around her every day,\" Morrow said of her decision to come to LSU. \"We are doing nothing but making each other better.\"\nAs good as the 34-2 Tigers were last season, Reese hopes they can improve. She's not just about winning games, but also winning over new fans.\n\"Women are changing the game,\" she said. \"I mean, 9.9 million people watched the [national championship] game. The feedback we've gotten, men and women reach out to us, celebrities, NBA players. Seeing we have so many people in our corner, I think that helps.\""}

He looks like third- or fourth-year LeBron.\"\nThe fact is, however, James is entering into his 21st season and as athletic as he still might appear, the team and its medical staff have to take measures to protect him in coordination with James' longtime athletic trainer, Mike Mancias.\n\"We collaborate and communicate on what those steps will be,\" Ham said. \"We make sure we come up with an effective plan.

The Mets entered the year with the largest payroll in Major League Baseball history and World Series aspirations. They ended it having dealt nearly a quarter of their major league roster at the trade deadline and finishing 75-87, fourth place in the National League East division and 29 games behind first-place Atlanta.\nEppler was hired in late 2021 after the Mets fired Zack Scott, their interim GM, who had been charged with DWI but later was found not guilty. Scott replaced Jared Porter, who was fired 38 days after being hired following an ESPN report that he had sent explicit text messages to a female reporter.\nStearns, 38, joined the Mets after seven seasons running the Milwaukee Brewers that included four playoff appearances. While his arrival in Queens had been long expected, there was no indication in his introductory news conference three days ago that Eppler would not be part of the team's infrastructure.\n\"He decided it is in everyone's best interest to fully hand over the leadership of baseball operations to David Stearns,\" Cohen said Thursday in a statement.\nEppler's first season with the Mets, whom he joined after five years as Los Angeles Angels GM, wound up with 101 wins -- and an ignominious loss to San Diego in the wild-card round.\nWhile Eppler warranted praise for a 2022 offseason in which he signed ace Max Scherzer and acquired steady starter Chris Bassitt, his lack of urgency at the trade deadline led to a trio of dud moves, as the team added only designated hitter Daniel Vogelbach, first baseman Darin Ruf and outfielder Tyler Naquin.\nAt the deadline a year earlier, in an ill-fated effort to make the postseason, the Mets had traded outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, who would become a top prospect, for infielder Javier Baez.\nThe Mets' spending spree this past winter brought back closer Edwin Diaz and center fielder Brandon Nimmo while adding future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander and Japanese star Kodai Senga to the rotation. Diaz's season-ending injury in the World Baseball Classic cast a pall on the season, and by the time the deadline rolled around, the Mets punted, trading Scherzer to the Texas Rangers and Verlander to the Houston Astros.\nNew York enters a seminal winter, with two-way star Shohei Ohtani -- whom Eppler signed as GM of the Angels -- reaching free agency and the Mets mulling the future of first baseman Pete Alonso, who is a year away from free agency and hired agent Scott Boras this week.\nThe Mets also will continue looking for a manager after Stearns fired Showalter, whom Eppler hired in December 2021, three months into his tenure."}

(0:33)\nNorth Carolina wide receiver Tez Walker will be eligible to play in 2023 after new information emerged that the NCAA said school officials \"failed to provide\" previously.\nWalker is a transfer from Kent State, and his initial eligibility for the 2023 season was denied because he had transferred twice. His case became a flashpoint for NCAA rules, in part because Walker hadn't played during the COVID-19 season of 2020 at North Carolina Central, which did not have a season because of the pandemic.\nThursday's announcement did not specify what the new information was that prompted the NCAA to reverse its decision. Walker missed No. 14 North Carolina's first four games, which the NCAA intimated in a statement could have been avoided if the university staff had \"submitted this information weeks ago.\"\nEven with Walker's eligibility confirmed after months of public bickering, NCAA officials and UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham sparred publicly in statements Thursday in the wake of the decision. The NCAA said the \"entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided\" with timely submission of materials. Cunningham responded that UNC put forward the information as it was made available and said the NCAA \"delayed making the correct decision.\"\nThe school posted a video to social media later Thursday that showed Tar Heels coach Mack Brown delivering the news to Walker about his eligibility.\nThe moment @DevontezWalker found out he's eligible 💙🐏#CarolinaFootball 🏈 #UNCommon pic.twitter.com/DQLjUx6Dm5\nWalker, widely considered a top-50 prospect for next year's NFL draft, transferred to North Carolina in part to play with star quarterback Drake Maye.\nWalker is eligible to join the undefeated Tar Heels for Saturday's game against Syracuse, and a source told ESPN that he is expected to play, as he has been practicing with the team. His snaps are uncertain at this point.\nThe 6-foot-3 wide receiver hauled in 58 receptions for 921 yards and 11 touchdowns last season at Kent State.\n\"I'm so excited and thankful that the NCAA has granted my eligibility to play this season,\" Walker said in a statement. \"This hasn't been easy, but I'm looking forward to putting this in the past and moving forward. I always knew UNC was a special place, but it's proved it over and over again throughout the last few months. I've received so much support from the University, the athletics department, my coaches, the staff and my teammates.\"\nIn an unusually pointed statement, both NCAA president Charlie Baker and Georgia president Jere Morehead, the Division I board of directors chair, chastised North Carolina officials for their handling of Walker's case.\n\"It is unfortunate that UNC failed to provide this important information previously,\" the NCAA said in its statement, which is attributed to both Baker and Morehead. \"While we must be careful not to compromise a student-athlete's right to privacy when it comes to sensitive issues, we want to assure the Division I membership and everyone watching how the new transfer rules are applied, that this meets the new transfer waiver standards.\"\nThe statement concluded: \"UNC's behavior and decision to wage a public relations campaign is inappropriate and outside the bounds of the process UNC's own staff supported. Had the UNC staff not behaved in this fashion and submitted this information weeks ago, this entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided.\"\nUNC chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said in a statement: \"In our stated effort to exhaust all avenues, new information about this matter came to our attention and we immediately gathered and submitted it for consideration.

We want to express our gratitude to the people at UNC who have worked tirelessly to assist Tez. We never gave up. We also want to thank the NCAA for being willing to re-examine Tez's case, and ultimately deciding to grant him his eligibility.\"\nThe last previous ruling on Walker came Sept. 7, and it sparked criticism in statements from Brown and Cunningham.\nBrown said at the time that he didn't know whether he had \"ever been more disappointed\" in a group than he was in the NCAA. He ended his statement by saying: \"SHAME ON YOU!\" Cunningham called the decision \"maddening, frustrating and wrong.\"\nThat prompted an NCAA response the next week, with Morehead and another official chastising North Carolina officials and saying they were \"troubled\" by the school's response.

{"title": "Fitzgerald suing NU for $130M for wrongful firing", "date": "2023-10-06 01:30:08", "text": "Attorney Dan K. Webb announces a \"major lawsuit\" against Northwestern on behalf of former coach Pat Fitzgerald for wrongful termination. (2:35)\nCHICAGO -- Former Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald filed a wrongful termination lawsuit Thursday against the university and president Michael Schill, in which he is seeking in excess of $130 million for lost earnings as well as reputational and punitive damages.\nFitzgerald alleges Northwestern unlawfully fired him for cause July 10, three days after announcing a two-week suspension as part of corrective measures from a university-commissioned hazing investigation into the program. Northwestern's investigation, led by attorney Maggie Hickey, found that while claims of hazing from a former player were largely corroborated, there was not sufficient evidence Fitzgerald and other coaches and staff had knowledge of the incidents.\nAttorney Dan Webb, who filed the lawsuit, said Northwestern fired Fitzgerald based on \"no new facts, no new developments whatsoever, zero.\" Schill said July 8, hours after The Daily Northwestern reported details of the hazing allegations from the former player, that he \"may have erred\" with the initial discipline for Fitzgerald. Schill fired Fitzgerald two days later.\nWebb said Fitzgerald and Northwestern reached an \"oral agreement\" before the two-week suspension was announced that the coach would face no further discipline from the university.\n\"The fact that he was terminated based on no rational reasons or facts whatsoever, the fact that they've gone out and destroyed his reputation as one of the best football coaches in America, based on no legitimate reason or evidence, is disgraceful,\" said Webb, a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois who now serves as co-executive chairman of the Winston & Strawn law firm. \"It's despicable conduct on behalf of Northwestern. My client and his family are entitled to their day in court for justice.\"\nAfter conducting interviews with dozens of former Northwestern players and coaches, Webb said he does not believe \"any significant hazing occurred\" within the program but noted that new evidence could emerge at trial. He has asked for but not received Hickey's full investigative report; the university released an executive summary July 7 in announcing Fitzgerald's suspension. The lawsuit states that Fitzgerald fully cooperated with the investigation and was never confronted with any evidence he knew about hazing within the program.\nSince Webb is opposing Northwestern, he cannot talk to current players or coaches but expects to call them as witnesses at trial.\n\"They're going to say they didn't see any significant hazing other than horseplay ... between young men in the locker room,\" Webb said of those he has interviewed.\nThe lawsuit states that Fitzgerald met with Northwestern general counsel Stephanie Graham and athletic director Derrick Gragg on July 3. They presented him a plan where he would accept some punishment because of the findings in the investigation.\n\"Gragg also stated that Schill felt Fitzgerald needed to 'take a hit' for the findings summarized in the Hickey Report, even though the Hickey Report concluded that Fitzgerald and his staff did not know about any hazing activities within the Northwestern football program,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Gragg and Graham told Fitzgerald that if he agreed to this plan, wanted the two week suspension to coincide with Fitzgerald's two-week vacation, so Fitzgerald could attend an important recruiting event on Northwestern's behalf shortly after his suspension ended.\"\nWebb said the anonymous whistleblower who first came forward in November \"had a grudge against ... Coach Fitzgerald\" and that the player's plan to report false allegations of hazing was reported to Fitzgerald by a teammate during a leadership council meeting in November. A current player told ESPN in July that the whistleblower had informed him of a detailed plan with the sole objective to take down Fitzgerald. The current player relayed a conversation he said he had with the former player early this year to Northwestern trustees and other influential university figures.\nIn a response to Thursday's lawsuit, Northwestern said \"multiple current or former\" players under Fitzgerald admitted to investigators hazing that \"included nudity and sexualized acts\" occurred. The university also referred to the lawsuits filed by more than a dozen former Northwestern football players against the university -- many named Fitzgerald and Schill as defendants -- alleging they experienced and/or witnessed hazing while in the program under Fitzgerald, who led Northwestern's program from July 2006 until earlier this year.\nA two-time national defensive player of the year at Northwestern, Fitzgerald was the winningest coach in team history, going 110-101.\n\"As head coach of the football program for 17 years, Patrick Fitzgerald was responsible for the conduct of the program,\" Northwestern said in a statement. \"He had the responsibility to know that hazing was occurring and to stop it. He failed to do so. ... The safety of our students remains our highest priority, and we deeply regret that any student-athletes experienced hazing. We remain confident that the University acted appropriately in terminating Fitzgerald and we will vigorously defend our position in court.\"\nResponding to the claim Fitzgerald should have known about what was happening, Webb said, \"That's a ridiculous allegation, not supported by any evidence whatsoever.\"\nWebb said the out-of-pocket damages he is seeking for Fitzgerald include $68 million that remained on his contract, which ran through 2030, as well as future earnings losses of approximately $62 million. The lawsuit also is claiming reputational damages, emotional distress and punitive damages. Webb intends to call an expert witness who will show that Fitzgerald will \"not work again at the same level, ever again.\"\nThe lawsuit also claims no Northwestern player, coach or staff member ever reported hazing allegations directly to Fitzgerald. According to the claim, an anonymous complaint was submitted to the athletic department in August 2022 of \"serious misconduct and hazing,\" which Northwestern and police investigated and determined was unfounded.\nWebb noted Fitzgerald was proactive with anti-hazing training and told players, including freshmen and transfers, of a zero-tolerance policy within the program. Players also had several outlets to report hazing and mistreatment.\nSince July, Northwestern has implemented new mandatory anti-hazing training for all its teams before each season and hired former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to conduct a larger review of how allegations are reported in the program.\n\"Northwestern's hired a former attorney general that's going to come in and tell Northwestern where they somehow went wrong and could find a better program,\" Webb said. \"Well, they're not going to find it. My expert's going to explain to the jury that what Fitzgerald did was truly second to none in any coaching program in the United States.\"\nWebb said he talked with Northwestern about an out-of-court settlement but was \"unsuccessful.\"\n\"Settlement's always an option, but I have no reason to say that's going to happen,\" Webb said.\nA group of attorneys representing players who have filed lawsuits against Northwestern issued a statement in response to Fitzgerald's lawsuit.\n\"The filing of the lawsuit by former coach Patrick Fitzgerald is clearly all about financial gain for him and is incredibly tone deaf in defending his actions. His complaint ironically details claims that he was deeply involved in each player's life, mental health, academic career, athletic performance and potential after graduation ... all of which actually supports what we've been saying all along, that given the head coach's proximity he knew or should have known what was happening in his program. This is the legal standard: knew or should have known about the abuse, and we feel strongly that the civil lawsuits brought by his former players have merit. Together we represent numerous former players who have provided detailed allegations of abuse. We are united in our goal to get them the justice they deeply deserve,\" read the statement from the attorneys from Levin & Perconti, Ben Crump Law, Romanucci & Blandin and Hart McLaughlin & Eldridge.\nAttorney Margaret Battersby Black said she has seen evidence from more than 80 victims of the Northwestern hazing scandal (far more than the number of lawsuits filed so far).\n\"That [Fitzgerald] allows his lawyer to so callously call these former family members liars shows you everything that you need to know about the culture that he established at this school,\" Battersby Black said. \"And he's trying to continue to suppress and victimize these young men by painting himself as the victim.\""}

(1:06)\nMel Tucker's lawyers sent a 106-page letter that presents \"new evidence\" to Michigan State's interim president and board of trustees Thursday morning as the administrative hearing tied to the misconduct allegations against the former Spartans football coach began.\nThe letter, which is from one of Tucker's attorneys and was released widely to the media, says the woman who brought forth the claim against Tucker that led to his firing, sexual assault awareness speaker Brenda Tracy, \"appears to have made a career out of misleading and manipulating people.\"\nThe letter attempts to detail contradictions in the allegations from Tracy, who filed the formal complaint against Tucker with the school's office of civil rights in December 2022. It says she \"manipulated a key witness,\" \"deleted key evidence\" and selectively gave transcripts to the Office of Institutional Equity.\nTracy's attorney, Karen Truszkowski, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Truszkowski previously told ESPN that she and Tracy would be appearing at the school's sexual misconduct hearing.\nMichigan State fired Tucker for cause Sept. 27. The next day, Tucker's lawyers sent a note to preserve documentation \"in anticipation of litigation.\" At stake for Tucker beyond the hearing is the $79 million he had remaining on his contract. After initially suspending Tucker without pay pending the hearing, the school fired him, saying he violated the moral turpitude clause and that his admitted actions on a phone call with Tracy brought ridicule on the school.\nThe letter sent out Thursday is the latest in a tense back-and-forth between Tucker's side and the school, with this letter being sent by attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal. It attempts to catch Tracy in conflicting statements, using dozens of messages between her and her assistant, who is now deceased. It does not say specifically how the messages were obtained.\nThe letter, in part, alleges that Tracy's motivations for filing the complaint are financial. One of Tucker's lawyers shared what Tucker's team says are partially redacted parts of conversations Tracy had with her former assistant where they discuss her finances and the notion that she would be open to settling her claims with Tucker.\n\"I'm filing a formal complaint with MSU,\" Tracy wrote, according to the letter. \"... [My lawyer] said after that we can let him know that we want to come to an agreement then it doesn't have to go to a hearing or anything unless he wants it to.\"\nAccording to the messages provided by Tucker's lawyers, Tracy later added: \"Money is my only recourse to make him feel like there is a punishment\" and \"when they do the money I should make him pay me 10k directly.\"\nThe letter criticizes the MSU investigation for failing \"to attempt to get fulsome text exchanges\" for the Office of Institutional Equity investigation. It alleges the school left out Tracy having good feelings about her experience after Michigan State's spring game.\n\"Blessings on blessings when you stay the course and do what's right. ... No regrets. My heart is good and so is my conscience[.]\"\nThe messages came before the alleged phone encounter that became one of the focuses of the claim. Tracy said it wasn't consensual, but Tucker has disagreed.\nThe letter was released minutes after the hearing began Thursday morning. Tucker will not attend the hearing, the letter states, because of a medical condition the letter doesn't disclose."}

{"title": "Rivalry renewed: Cowboys-49ers matchup retaking its place atop the NFL", "date": "2023-10-06 12:34:02", "text": "Damien Woody details the importance of the Cowboys' matchup vs. the 49ers in a few weeks. (0:54)\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Less than an hour after the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys dispatched their Week 4 opponents, they had no desire to take the customary 24 hours to bask in their latest wins. They were already thinking about something else: each other.\nIn their locker rooms after beating the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots, respectively, multiple Niners and Cowboys wasted no time looking ahead to their Week 5 \"Sunday Night Football\" clash (8:20 p.m. ET, Levi's Stadium, NBC).\nAfter all, 49ers (4-0) vs. Cowboys (3-1) is not only a matchup of two of the league's best teams this season, but one of the most historically significant rivalries in NFL history. A rivalry that only recently has been brought back to life.\n\"It's an important game,\" said Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, who was San Francisco's offensive coordinator in 2005. \"You understand the history. There is obviously a lot of tradition with this game. That's all part of it. You live to play in these kinds of games. You dream about these kinds of games. You don't want to make it bigger than what it is, but the reality is it's not just another game.\"\nTheirs is a rivalry borne not out of geography or divisional alignment but of repeated meetings in the postseason crucible.\nIt started in the 1970s, when the Cowboys won consecutive NFC Championship Games over the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 seasons and bested San Francisco in a divisional playoff game in 1972. In the 1980s, the 49ers won four Super Bowls, beating the Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 10, 1982, on the strength of \"The Catch\" by Dwight Clark, arguably the most memorable moment of the rivalry.\nDallas came storming back in the 1990s, knocking off the Niners in the NFC Championship Game after the 1992 and 1993 seasons on its way to two Super Bowl titles. San Francisco finally got past Dallas the next season in the NFC Championship Game on its way to its fifth (and most recent) Lombardi Trophy. The Cowboys would bounce back to win their fifth (and most recent) championship the following year.\nAnd then ... nothing.\nThe teams did not meet again in the postseason until a wild-card game on Jan. 16, 2022, a span of 9,863 days. The teams met again last season in the NFC divisional round. The 49ers won both games by a combined 13 points, reviving the rivalry and setting the stage for Sunday night.\n\"Anytime you play each other in the playoffs, it's always usually a bit bigger the next year,\" said Niners coach Kyle Shanahan, who was a ball boy for the team in the 1990s when his father, Mike, was the 49ers' offensive coordinator. \"And with that being back-to-back, it was huge. That's what I always remembered growing up ...\n\"They played in the NFC Championship all three years that I lived here. So just playing them in the playoffs two years ago kind of was reminiscent of that ... and those histories stack up just like people in your division. But usually when it's a playoff game everyone remembers it a little bit more.\"\nSunday's matchup will feature many familiar faces from their past two meetings. Besides the head coaches, star players such as linebacker Micah Parsons, quarterback Dak Prescott, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, guard Zack Martin and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb still dot the Cowboys roster while the Niners lean on their own galaxy of stars such as defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner, running back Christian McCaffrey, offensive tackle Trent Williams and quarterback Brock Purdy.\nMost of those players were not born or were infants and toddlers for those 1990s playoff meetings, but the history of the rivalry has been ingrained and reinforced by the atmosphere surrounding the past two playoff matchups.\n\"You know prior to here, I saw it was definitely big,\" Parsons said. \"When they came down here [in the 2021 playoffs], I really saw it my rookie year and seeing it last year, how big that game was ... that impacted me that 'Oh, this is serious.'\"\nMarcus Spears explains that the Cowboys need to beat the 49ers as a confidence boost after dropping two straight playoff games to San Francisco.\nThe challenge this week for both teams is to understand how serious this meeting is without putting too much importance on it. Yes, it's only Week 5 and a loss probably won't determine each team's fate this season. But there are long-term ramifications that come with Sunday's result. Playoff seeding and home-field advantage might seem like far-off conversations, but a win Sunday night could go a long way in determining potential tiebreakers for those benchmarks.\nWhat's more, neither team has played a particularly daunting schedule to date. Dallas' opponents are 3-9 and San Francisco's 6-6 in games.\nSuffice to say, Sunday night should offer a good barometer of how far along these two expected Super Bowl contenders are.\n\"It's a huge test,\" Warner said. \"To say that it isn't would be naïve and downplaying the moment, I think. I'm excited for that moment. I know our team is excited for it.\"\nOne semi-new element is the introduction of the Sunday night lights. The 49ers and Cowboys haven't played a prime-time game against each other since November 1990. Their only other prime-time matchups came on \"Monday Night Football\" in 1977 and 1983.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nSunday's meeting will also likely break a tie in the all-time series, as the teams enter knotted at 19-19-1. In addition to their five Super Bowl titles apiece, the Niners and Dallas rank Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, all time in NFC playoff wins and conference championship game appearances.\nBut, as Cowboys owner Jerry Jones alluded to earlier this week, for as important as Sunday's meeting is, it very well could be a warmup act for a third straight playoff meeting in January. Because, as both sides are quick to remind, when you play for two of the NFL's most successful franchises, the only thing better than beating the other side is winning the whole darn thing.\n\"There's always a path in the NFC that goes through Dallas, goes through San Francisco,\" McCarthy said. \"I like to think that's what makes this sport so great, the respect you need to have for your history.\""}
{"title": "The Eagles are so good at the 'tush push' that the NFL may ban it", "date": "2023-10-06 12:34:02", "text": "Pat McAfee and crew examine the controversy around the Eagles' signature \"tush push\" play. (1:11)\nPHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Eagles were facing a fourth-and-1 at midfield early in the second quarter Sunday, and everyone in the stadium knew what was coming before the offense even lined up.\nA capacity crowd of nearly 70,000 rose for a standing ovation, anticipating perhaps the most talked about play in the NFL.\nThe \"tush push.\"\nOr is it the \"brotherly shove?\" The nicknames vary, but the results have been remarkably consistent.\n\"It's been a good play for us,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"A really good play for us.\"\nThe play is a glorified sneak where the quarterback is pushed forward by teammates lined up behind him. It has been wildly successful for the Eagles since they made it a regular part of their offense in 2022. They have run it 37 times in the regular season, per ESPN Stats & Information, and have gotten a first down or scored a touchdown on 34 of those attempts for a success rate of 92%.\nOther teams are following suit -- there have been 36 attempts through four weeks, up from five at this point in 2022 -- with mixed results. Four teams are 0-for-1, but the overall success rate is 81%.\n\"It's not as automatic as people think, as we're seeing across the NFL,\" Sirianni said.\nThese teams attempted the most push sneak plays since the start of the 2022 season, including playoffs, through Week 4.\nIt might not be automatic for the Eagles, but it's close. And their success might explain why it has become controversial, with critics saying it's more rugby than football and should be outlawed. The rules committee will review the play in the offseason, and the league alerted officials to watch for infractions such as illegal formations and blocks. The backlash prompted the take-your-whining-and-stick-it standing ovation during Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders as Eagles fans showed their support for a play that has become part of the team's identity.\n\"Well, it's not being officiated as illegal, so we just have to prepare for it,\" Washington defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio said before the game. \"I would personally like to see it eliminated, not just because they run it better than anybody, although they do run it better than anybody. But I don't think that's a football play. I think it's a nice rugby play, and it's not what we're looking for in football.\"\nThe debate is starting to heat up. The NFL competition committee was \"split\" over whether to outlaw the play this offseason, per Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay, who is also the chairman of the competition committee. There wasn't enough support to propose a rule change at the league meetings in March, but multiple members of the committee said they'd further analyze the play this coming offseason, when more injury-related data will be available.\nOn Monday night, two members of the New York Giants -- rookie center John Michael Schmitz and tight end Daniel Bellinger -- were hurt while executing a tush push in the first quarter of a 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, and they did not return.\n\"I think in the near future, rules might change,\" Tampa Bay Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield said. \"But for now, offenses might as well take advantage of it.\"\nThe fact that not all teams have taken advantage as successfully as the Eagles strengthens the argument that the play is less about the push and more about the men attached to the tush.\n\"There is clearly a talent to it that our guys have,\" Sirianni said. \"I get that some people are complaining about it, but stop it. Stop the play.\"\nSirianni couldn't pinpoint exactly how the quarterback push made its way into the Eagles' scheme, but he cited the goal-line sequence at the end of the 2005 classic between USC and Notre Dame as the moment the play pierced the football world's collective consciousness.\nWith the Trojans trailing by three with seven seconds left, quarterback Matt Leinart ran a sneak and was greeted by a wall of Irish defenders who appeared to have had him stopped. But Reggie Bush flew in and shoved Leinart into the end zone for the score.\nThe play -- known as the \"Bush push\" -- was against the NCAA rules at the time (although not any longer), but no flag was thrown.\nAlso in 2005, the NFL removed language from the rulebook that prohibited pushing a ball-carrier forward. But the purpose was to eliminate a tough judgment call for the referees, not to open the door for the modified QB sneak.\nThere was concern by officials that in some of the goal-line situations it was \"very hard to tell when a guy was coming in to block and when a guy was coming in to push. So we took it out,\" McKay said in March. \"We did not think it would become a strategy, and here we are.\"\nThe first Eagles tush push in ESPN's database came in Week 1 of last season against the Detroit Lions, when they snuck it on fourth-and-1 for a first down to secure a 38-35 win.\n\"I love pushin', man,\" said Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert, one of the players responsible for muscling Hurts through the line of scrimmage. \"It's fun to be back there. It's fun to see the defeat on defenses' faces before we even run the play.\"\nSome players inside the Eagles locker room are hesitant to share the intricacies of the play. \"You don't go into McDonald's and ask for the Big Mac sauce recipe,\" guard Landon Dickerson said. But the basic tenets are cut and dry.\nHurts picks a gap on either side of the center, and dives in after the snap. As soon as he meets resistance, the two players behind him rush in and begin to push Hurts forward.\nThe Eagles have one of the most savvy centers in the game in Jason Kelce, and he's surrounded by massive men in Dickerson (6-foot-6, 332 pounds), Jordan Mailata (6-8, 365 pounds), Lane Johnson (6-6, 325 pounds) and -- to a lesser extent -- Cam Jurgens (6-3, 303 pounds).\nThen there's Hurts, the former high school powerlifter who can squat 600 pounds -- a level of strength that comes in handy when you're trying to force your way through a mass of humanity.\n\"They're putting the two H-backs right behind the quarterback, and it's kind of like a rugby scrum,\" said Dan Koppen, a former New England Patriots center who helped pave the way for arguably the best QB-sneak artist of time, Tom Brady. \"And now you've got 1,500 pounds upfront. You've got a 200-250-pound quarterback [Hurts is listed at 223], and then you've got 250-400 pounds more pushing from the back.\n\"It's a really hard play to stop.\"\nOut of the 36 attempts at the push this season through Week 4, 29 have resulted in first downs, including four touchdowns.\n\"It helps having a guy like Gabe Davis or Reggie Gilliam behind you pushing the pile,\" said Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. \"Those are two strong guys.\n\"But I think it's just kind of low man wins. If our O-line can get low, and I can get low behind them, we're going to have some success. Now if it's the other way around, not so much success.\"\nThe QB push against the Commanders that had the Lincoln Financial Field crowd on its feet didn't count. Dickerson was called for the rare offensive offside. The Eagles were penalized 5 yards and had to punt.\nKelce said the NFL had given them notice the week leading up to the Washington game that it was going to \"start looking for offensive players sneaking into the neutral zone.\" Sirianni confirmed it was a point of emphasis for officials that week. Video appears to show Dickerson's hand in line with the ball pre-snap, but Kelce said that was actually his hand, as he gets into a four-point position on QB sneaks.\n\"I think they messed this up actually,\" Kelce said on his \"New Heights\" podcast. \"But that's what happens when you go searching for things.\"\nAfter declining to bring the legality of the play to a vote in March, the competition committee sent out a memo to all 32 teams recommending that the NFL football operations department \"closely monitor\" specific techniques utilized by the offense, including illegal formations, chop blocks and personal fouls \"like spearing and use of the helmet by an offensive player in an effort to gain leverage and push the pile forward.\"\n• Why the 'tush push' might get banned\n• Love's completion rate ranks last\n• O'Brien sees glimpses with Jones\n• Stroud knew Collins would be special\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\n• Saints look for offensive change\n• Cowboys, 49ers renew rivalry\nOne common thought is defenses will begin taking extreme measures to halt the play now that it is gaining in popularity with a reputation of being unstoppable.\n\"My fear now is some of the linemen are going to get some knees chopped,\" New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr said. \"And soon as that happens, I'm sure there'll be a rule change.\"\nCommanders coach Ron Rivera, a member of the competition committee, indicated the QB push will be put further under the microscope this offseason.\n\"It is something that we all have to study,\" Rivera said. \"There'll be a lot of issues that'll come up. There'll be some safety issues that'll probably be brought up. There may be some refereeing issues that'll be brought up, but I can't speak for anybody else on it. I think it will be a point of conversation.\"\nTime might not be on the side of the tush push, but the rest of the 2023 season offers an opportunity to those who have mastered the play.\n\"We did a lot of studies on everything in the offseason to help ourselves be even better at it,\" Sirianni said, \"but it's about those guys up front. It's about Jalen.\n\"I think we would be pretty successful without the push, but we're just pushing them sometimes to give that extra thump.\"\nContributing: John Keim, Brooke Pryor, Todd Archer"}
{"title": "Arsenal should be concerned by Man City's return to form ahead of heavyweight clash in Premier League", "date": "2023-10-06 12:43:55", "text": "Nedum Onuoha explains why he isn't worried that Manchester City's defense has had trouble holding teams scoreless. (1:38)\nManchester City go to Arsenal on Sunday for a top of the Premier League table clash with confidence restored and normal winning service resumed.\nI was on hand in Germany to watch Pep Guardiola's team boss possession and the game in their 3-1 win over RB Leipzig on Wednesday in the UEFA Champions League, inspired by a moment of genius from Julián Álvarez as he chipped a delicious goal to effectively win the game following a spell of stubborn resistance from the Bundesliga side. The result ended any concerns that City might be showing signs of vulnerability after successive losses to Newcastle and Wolves.\nThe defending Premier League champions have not lost three games in a row in a single season since 2018 and never looked like doing so in Leipzig, where their share of possession was a staggering 88% at one stage.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nThe return of midfield anchor Rodri, who was available to play in Europe despite his current domestic ban, made a significant difference. Manchester City lose only seven percent of games when Rodri plays, rising to 33% when he is missing.\nYou can easily make the case that he's one of the team's mot valuable players, and the good news for Arsenal is that Rodri cannot play on Sunday. It is the final game of his three-match suspension and so the key to this big match might be how effectively City can cover Rodri's absence in that \"No. 6\" role.\nGuardiola clearly does not trust Kalvin Phillips and Mateo Kovacic; for all his class, Kovacic failed when handed the job in the shocking defeat by Wolves. John Stones, out since the Community Shield in August, is fit again and was on the bench in Germany. He has the nous and passing range to play that anchor role if needed, but is he going to be ready or sharp enough for a start against Arsenal after seeing so little action so far this season? It is a difficult dilemma for Guardiola, who will have to improvise in a key area of the pitch.\nOne man who certainly advanced his case in Leipzig was 18-year-old Rico Lewis, who was a bundle of ideas and energy alongside Rodri. When asked to assess the display of the Manchester-born youngster, Guardiola smiled broadly and said, \"Wow!\"\nMore cheer for City is the return from injury of Bernardo Silva, which means Kevin De Bruyne is the only significant name still in the treatment room. Against that, however, Jack Grealish looked subdued in the Champions League after returning from a nasty leg injury, and against Arsenal he could lose his starting spot to the pacy and direct Jérémy Doku, who scored City's third goal in Germany.\nMeanwhile Erling Haaland, typically a goal-scoring machine, is experiencing a rare dry spell. Five games without netting is his longest Champions League drought, and he hardly got a kick against Wolves' warhorse Craig Dawson last weekend. However, a hungry Haaland is never quiet for long and still has eight goals in 11 games this season.\nArsenal, for whom the title is a holy grail, not having won it since the 2003-04 season, will certainly provide a far stiffer test than a rather unambitious Leipzig. Still stinging from the way City conquered them last season, the Gunners approach will be fascinating in manager Mikel Arteta's latest mind game against his old City boss and mentor, Guardiola.\nYou suspect Arsenal's Champions League loss at Lens, where Bukayo Saka picked up an injury, might have been caused by minds already focused on the big clash against City. It is not in Arsenal's DNA to sit back at home and play on the counter, but Wolves showed that denying City's playmakers those half spaces might be the most effective game plan.\nHowever, a bolder, adventurous approach by Arsenal could easily backfire. Consider this: Both Fulham and Spurs have gone to the Emirates and exploited defensive shortcomings in 2-2 draws.\nThe gap between the teams narrowed to only one point last weekend, with City atop the table on 18 points, but their midweek win in Saxony sent out an ominous warning that City are back to their winning ways. And that, more than anything else, should worry Arsenal."}
{"title": "Who should struggling Chelsea have signed instead? Osimhen, Szoboszlai, more", "date": "2023-10-06 12:43:55", "text": "James Olley explains why the short-term pressure on Chelsea to get results will all fall on Mauricio Pochettino. (1:05)\nChelsea spent an unprecedented £1 billion across the last three transfer windows, but it hasn't really worked so far. The club have won two of their seven games, drawing two and losing three under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and sit 11th in the Premier League table -- already 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester City.\nWhile they have amassed a group of some of the most-talented young players in the world, all on long-term contracts, it's possible their strategy might have been better focused towards more experienced players who could make an immediate impact.\nHindsight is a wonderful thing, but here's who Chelsea should have put their faith in over the summer.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nHaving let Romelu Lukaku (loan to AS Roma), Kai Havertz (£65 million to Arsenal) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (free transfer to Marseille) depart, Chelsea were left with the injured 22-year-old Armando Broja and untried Brazilian 18-year-old, Deivid Washington as the only out-and-out centre-forwards in the squad.\nNicolas Jackson, who arrived for £30m from Villarreal this summer, can also play through the middle, despite having the skillset of a winger or even second striker. While Raheem Sterling (£47.5m), Mykhailo Mudryk (£62m) and, before his long-term injury, Christopher Nkunku (£52m), can all do a job as a \"false No. 9.\" However, with a proven goal scorer arguably the first priority when revamping a side, you would have thought Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly would have signed one.\nChelsea have scored just seven goals in their seven Premier League games -- Man City have 17, for context -- and Sterling is their top scorer with two.\nJulien Laurens explains why Napoli's social media posts mocking Victor Osimhen couldn't have come at a worse time.\nLast season's Serie A top scorer for Napoli is widely regarded as one of the leading centre-forwards in the game, arguably behind only Man City's Erling Haaland and now-Bayern Munich star Harry Kane in the pecking order of world-class No. 9s.\nNapoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is known for driving a hard bargain, but a fee of £150m would likely have got a transfer done -- long before the Italian club upset their star man by making fun of him on social media -- which is small change for a club that have spent so much across the rest of the team, especially on untried teenagers.\nOsimhen, 24, is an excellent finisher (26 Serie A goals last season; five from six games this campaign) and the Nigeria international's movement across the defensive line, speed to stretch the opponents and aerial strength would be of exceptional value to a team that are a lot better at creating chances than converting them.\nParis Saint-Germain beat their rivals to secure a loan move (with a £56m obligation to sign permanently next summer) for Ramos. The 22-year-old Portugal international may not have set Ligue 1 alight yet (two goals in six games), but he's already proven enough for Benfica (41 goals in 106) and Portugal (eight goals in six) to show he is one of the top young central strikers in Europe.\nRamos features a fine holdup game -- useful for creating space and combining with the wide forwards or midfield runners -- is strong in the air and has a quick finishing technique too. In terms of playing style, he would certainly have offered a set of qualities that the Chelsea squad lacks, while they could have paid Benfica the fee up front without the need for a loan.\nVlahovic only arrived at Juventus from Fiorentina for around £70m in January last year, but struggled to settle. Linked with a summer move to every top club in Europe, the 23-year-old was given another chance to shine this season and has four goals from six games to date.\nThose who have monitored the left-footed centre-forward since his early days will know he carries lots of unreleased potential. But would his style have suited Chelsea better? Given that Juventus usually line up deeper (and tend to press lower), with longer distances between the attacking players, it's reasonable to assume that Vlahovic would have seen a lot more of the ball in goal-scoring positions at Chelsea.\nWhile he has less than five touches in the attacking penalty area per 90 minutes, chances are that a fresh start in a new environment could also have worked wonders for a forward who often looks short of confidence.\nStewart Robson and Gab Marcotti discuss Moises Caicedo's potential transfer to Chelsea from Brighton.\nChelsea have central midfielders in abundance and they're as young as they are immensely talented.\nNo-one would doubt the intrinsic quality of the likes of Enzo Fernández (£106.8m), Moisés Caicedo (£100m), Romeo Lavia (£53m), Lesley Ugochukwu (£23.5m), Carney Chukwuemeka (£20m) or academy graduate Conor Gallagher. Yet the latter is the most experienced performer at the heart of the team at the age of 23 now that N'Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic have been moved on.\nThough this midfield setup is undoubtedly part of the club's policy of hoarding the elite young talent around the world, an experienced presence to organise, lead and dictate the rhythm of the game and plug holes is key to the strategic functioning of the side. Some experienced football scouts and executives may argue that spending hundreds of millions of pounds on young talent is all well and good, but without a veteran or two the kids' talent may end up being wasted.\nWhile it wouldn't have been a popular move with the fans, Fulham's Palhinha could have taken the short trip across west London to do the kind of job Rodri is carrying out each week for Manchester City. Tactically disciplined and strong in the tackle, Palhinha is capable of making the rest of the team tick with swift intelligent passes -- short and long -- while expertly positioning himself poised for counter-attacks, tackles and interceptions.\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is a Norwegian football scout and executive and is the former chief executive and sporting director at AS Monaco. He will write regularly for ESPN on the business of soccer and the process of scouting.\nCaicedo and Lavia are outstanding at distribution and recovery, but it often takes years of elite-level football to attain the patience and game-reading skills required to operate as a defensive-minded holding midfielder.\nAt 28, the Portugal international may not fit Chelsea's approach to the transfer market, but the fact that Bayern Munich, a club known for well-considered spending, were prepared to part with £56m -- which would have made him their fourth-most expensive signing ever -- speaks volumes about how highly his understated qualities are valued.\nThe ESPN FC crew debate how new Liverpool signing Dominik Szoboszlai will fit in at Anfield.\nWhile Pochettino should have no complaints about the names he can select from in this department, there might be a case to be made for Chelsea adding a more defined playmaker-type to organise proceedings in the final third -- especially after letting Mason Mount depart for Man United.\nSterling is an experienced star, Cole Palmer (£35m) and Noni Madueke (£30m) are wildcards given their lack of experience at the age of 22, while the 21-year-old Mudryk is starting to show something of his obvious potential, but Chelsea were hit hard by Nkunku's injury. The France international is likely to provide a significant impact on his return, but without him there is a bit of a drop in quality.\nIt's still a bit of a mystery how Liverpool ended up signing Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig for his £60m release clause without any serious competition from other top European clubs (i.e. not only Chelsea.)\nFrom providing a significant goal threat from outside the box, to brilliant set-piece deliveries, while constantly inviting linkups and combinations with teammates in the final third, the Hungary captain is as elegant as he's efficient.\nThough Chelsea are not short of No. 8 midfielders, Szoboszlai -- who also has good physicality and a fine pressing-game -- could even do a shift deeper in midfield. And at 22, he certainly represents future value, too.\nWolves' winger might have been a useful addition to a squad which so far this season has struggled with end product. Rather inexplicably overlooked by bigger clubs this summer -- perhaps due to uncertainties after serious ankle and knee injuries -- the 23-year-old can operate equally well on either side of the attack and has experience of the Premier League since 2019.\nThough it can be argued that Neto, with his pace and outstanding dribbling ability, thrives better in a counter-attacking side, he still has the technical ability to adapt to a high-tempo team that dominate possession. His acceleration and one-vs.-one abilities also make him suited to unlocking teams that tend to sit deep, while cash-strapped Wolves would have likely listened to offers this summer. He is already being linked with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as Chelsea, for future windows."}

(1:17)\nThe NHL is in a torch-passing mood as it enters the 2023-24 season.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights are the reigning Stanley Cup champions, having earned their first title since coming into the league in 2017 as an expansion team. The Seattle Kraken defeated the 2022 champs, the Colorado Avalanche, for their first playoff series win in their second season of existence.\nFor the first time in nine seasons, the top 10 scorers in the NHL were all under 30 years old, including Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson and Vancouver Canucks center Elias Pettersson, both just 24 years old.\nThen there's the rookie class for this season, a remarkably deep collection of talent led by 2023 first overall pick Connor Bedard, who has lifted the Chicago Blackhawks back to relevance before ever appearing in a regular-season NHL game.\nBut not everyone is ready to let go of the torch. Veteran teams like the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins are trying to raise the Cup again after major offseason changes. Meanwhile, the megastars in their prime on the Edmonton Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs are desperate to finally win their first rings.\nIf you haven't kept up with the NHL in the past few months, don't fret, we've got you covered. Here's a chance to catch up on everything that has happened -- the hirings, firings, signings and even a blockbuster trade. It's all in our guide to the 2023-24 season for lapsed fans. Read up before the puck drops on opening night this Tuesday!\nHow to watch the 2023-24 NHL season on ESPN networks -- including 100 exclusive games and the out-of-market package (over 1,050 games).\nThe biggest surprise about the Golden Knights lifting the Stanley Cup might have been that it wasn't the Bruins doing it instead.\nThe 2022-23 Bruins were the most successful regular-season team in NHL history, setting league records for wins (65) and points (135) in a season. The NHL awards confirmed that they had the league's best goalie (Linus Ullmark), best coach (Jim Montgomery) and best defensive forward (Patrice Bergeron), along with a 61-goal scorer in winger David Pastrnak. They were a juggernaut offensively and defensively. The question wasn't if they would win the Stanley Cup, but how long it would take them.\nAnd then they were upset in the first round by the Florida Panthers -- who would go on to face Vegas for the Stanley Cup -- losing at home in a Game 7 overtime that left Boston fans and players in stunned silence.\nIt wasn't just a loss on the ice for the Bruins. The offseason saw Bergeron, their much celebrated No. 1 center and captain, retire after 19 seasons. Their second-best center, David Krejci, retired after 16 seasons. The Bruins had made it their mission to send both of them off as champions. Instead, they have to pick themselves up off the canvas without them.\nThey aren't the only departures from Boston: Wingers Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno, Tyler Bertuzzi and defenseman Dmitry Orlov all switched teams in the offseason, too.\nCan new captain Brad Marchand and the Bruins who remain get back to the playoffs with these lineup holes? Is their defense corps, led by Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm, and goaltending (Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman) dominant enough to contend again? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nIf the Bruins falter, or another of last season's Eastern Conference playoff teams struggles, all eyes are on a trio of Atlantic Division teams that have been rebuilding towards getting back to the playoffs.\nThe Buffalo Sabres have garnered the most interest, having not made the playoffs since 2011. They have a newly minted star center in Tage Thompson and two great young defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.\nThe Ottawa Senators also have a breakout star in forward Tim Stutzle, who joins players like Brad Tkachuk and Claude Giroux in trying to get the Sens their first playoff spot since 2017 under new owner Michael Andlauer.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, who haven't made the playoffs since 2016, hope their mix of established veterans and younger talents finally brings GM Steve Yzerman's plans into sharper focus.\nBedard, 18, is the latest generational talent who had teams, ahem, \"rearranging their rosters\" in order to maximize their draft lottery odds. Chicago had the third-best odds when it won the lottery to secure the services of Bedard, selecting No. 1 overall for the first time since drafting Patrick Kane in 2007.\nThe hockey world had anticipated Bedard's NHL arrival for years. He was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. He racked up player of the year awards and led the Canadian junior team to two gold medals. Scouts have raved about the quality and accuracy of his shot, which produced 122 goals in 119 games over the past two seasons with the Regina Pats. He's unquestionably the most hyped rookie to arrive in the NHL since another Connor: Oilers star and reigning NHL MVP Connor McDavid, who was drafted in 2015.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBedard arrives during a transitional time for Chicago.\nThe Blackhawks' reputation is still on the mend after the 2021 investigation that made public the sexual assault allegations by former player Kyle Beach against the team's video coach Brad Aldrich during the 2010 season. Stan Bowman, the team's GM and president of hockey operations, and senior vice president of hockey operations Al MacIsaac both resigned in the aftermath, with current general manager Kyle Davidson taking over.\nKane and captain Jonathan Toews, the last on-ice links to the Blackhawks' three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, 2015), both parted ways with the franchise last season. In July, Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz died at 70 years old following an illness.\nBedard's arrival has certainly helped change the vibes for the Blackhawks.\nThe team sold $5.2 million worth of tickets after winning the draft lottery. The Blackhawks tell ESPN that they expect an increase of over 17% in tickets sold and overall 26% higher revenue growth than our initial 2023-24 season projections. They've nearly doubled their full season-ticket packages sold year over year.\nChicago hasn't made the playoffs in three seasons and probably won't again in Bedard's first season -- although the Blackhawks bolstered their rebuilding lineup with familiar names like Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. But they theoretically have their next franchise player and, more importantly, a point of demarcation with the past.\nBedard is far from the only notable first-year player in the NHL this season. In a league that's all about speed, scoring and low salary cap hits, more young players than ever are breaking into the NHL early. Some other rookies to watch this season:\nLogan Cooley had announced he was returning to the University of Minnesota, but instead the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 signed with the Arizona Coyotes ... where he will still play in an NCAA arena this season, but we digress.\nCenter Adam Fantilli, 18, was selected third overall in the 2023 draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets after being projected as the second-best prospect behind Bedard all season. (No. 2 overall was Leo Carlsson of the Anaheim Ducks.) The University of Michigan product won the Hobey Baker as the best men's player in the NCAA last season.\nAnother Michigan alum is defenseman Luke Hughes, who brought some chaotic energy to the New Jersey Devils' playoff run. He's expected to be an offensive force this season on a team that features his brother, star center Jack Hughes.\nGoalie Devon Levi could be entrusted by the Sabres to lead them to their first playoff berth since 2011. He dazzled in a brief stint with them last season.\nThe Maple Leafs made winger Matthew Knies untouchable at the trade deadline last season, and for good reason: The Hobey Baker finalist from Minnesota brings offensive skill and physicality in his game.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nKyle Dubas bet on himself as general manager of the Maple Leafs, entering last season without a contract beyond 2022-23. He seemingly won the wager, as the Leafs advanced past the opening round for the first time since 2004 by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning before losing to the Panthers.\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBut as Dubas' agent and team president Brendan Shanahan worked on a new contract, there was drama brewing. The ask from Dubas went up, and reportedly so did the amount of power he wanted in personnel decisions. Dubas held a news conference that didn't sit well with Shanahan, saying his future in Toronto required \"a full family discussion.\" Ultimately, Shanahan decided to let Dubas walk, hiring former Calgary GM Brad Treliving as his replacement.\nDubas also made it seem like it was Toronto or bust in that news conference, saying, \"I definitely don't have it in me to go anywhere else.\" Then the Penguins came calling after they fired team president Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall and ... well, maybe Pittsburgh isn't like anywhere else.\nDubas was named president of hockey operations and oversaw a search for the team's next general manager before finding the perfect candidate: Kyle Dubas, who will serve in that role for the foreseeable future. The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins, tasked him with two missions: Start thinking about what the next phase of this team looks like while doing everything he can to help the team's veteran core -- Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang -- become Stanley Cup champions for a fourth time since 2009.\nHis first move was a bit of managerial magic: a three-team trade that saw him move out some of the team's cap-problematic contracts while acquiring 33-year-old San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson, who won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman last season. Karlsson scored 101 points in 82 games. Another season like that, and the Penguins might have one more championship push left in them.\nBesides the Karlsson trade, there were other significant trades in the offseason:\nThe Los Angeles Kings acquired center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Winnipeg Jets in a package that included forwards Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi. A 25-year-old restricted free agent, Dubois was handed an eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois gives the Kings one of the deepest groups at center in the West, along with Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault.\nThe Devils, who defeated the New York Rangers for their first playoff series win since 2012, traded for winger Tyler Toffoli, who led the Calgary Flames with 34 goals last season.\nThe Avalanche acquired center Ryan Johansen from the Nashville Predators, who picked up half of his $8 million cap hit for the next two seasons to facilitate the trade.\nAfter scoring winger Alex DeBrincat made it clear that he wouldn't re-sign with the Senators, they sent him to the Red Wings in a trade that included a first-round pick and forward Dominik Kubalik.\nThe Blue Jackets added two veteran defensemen via trade, acquiring Ivan Provorov (Flyers) and Damon Severson (Devils). Severson received an eight-year, $50 million contract extension.\nThe St. Louis Blues benefited from the Philadelphia Flyers' salary dump, as they traded a sixth-round pick for center Kevin Hayes and had Philly pick up 50% of his salary for the remaining three years of the deal.\nSome interesting names ended up in even more interesting locations via free agency:\nThe NHL had a buyout window that was more active than usual. The players changing teams after having the remaining years on their contracts bought out included Jets captain Blake Wheeler, now with the Rangers; Predators center Matt Duchene, who signed with the Stars; winger Josh Bailey, who was traded to Chicago by the New York Islanders after 15 seasons, bought out by the Blackhawks, and then signed a professional tryout contract with the Senators; defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who was bought out by Vancouver and signed with the Panthers; and defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who now has the honor of being bought out by two different teams, with the Flyers ending his time in Philadelphia so he could rejoin the Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Bruins saw their two big trade deadline acquisitions move on. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, who were already stacked on defense, and Tyler Bertuzzi signed a one-year deal to play on Auston Matthews' wing with the Maple Leafs. Michael Bunting, who played with Matthews last season, signed with the Hurricanes. The Leafs also signed free agent defenseman John Klingberg to a one-year deal.\nStar center Ryan O'Reilly, who was picked up at the trade deadline by Toronto, surprised many by signing a four-year deal with the Predators.\nGoalie Joonas Korpisalo, one of the only big-name goalies available as free agency opened, inked a five-year contract with the Senators.\nWinger Alex Killorn, an essential role player on Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup teams, signed a four-year deal with the Ducks after 11 seasons with the Lightning.\nDefenseman Matt Dumba was cap-squeezed out of Minnesota and signed a one-year deal with the Coyotes.\nWinger James van Riemsdyk, defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and winger Milan Lucic all signed with the Bruins. It's a homecoming for Lucic, who was a fan favorite during eight years in Boston (2007-15).\nWinger Vladimir Tarasenko didn't find the deal he wanted in free agency, changed agents and then inked a one-year contract with the Senators.\nAmong the players who avoided free agency by re-signing with their teams are two Golden Knights playoff heroes in forward Ivan Barbashev (five years) and goalie Adin Hill (two years); goalie Tristan Jarry, who signed a five-year deal to stay with the Penguins; defenseman Scott Mayfield (seven years), who remained with the Islanders; goalies Frederik Andersen (two years) and Antti Raanta (one year), who stayed with the Hurricanes; and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who remained with the Kings on a two-year deal.\nOne name still available as the season begins: Patrick Kane, who split last season with the Blackhawks and Rangers before undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in the summer. He plans to play in 2023-24 and is waiting to see what the standings look like as the season progresses.\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews ended any speculation about his pending 2024 free agency by signing a four-year contract extension in August that gave him the highest annual average salary since the NHL instituted the cap: $13.25 million, topping the record Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon set in 2022 ($12.6 million).\nOther significant contract extensions included Devils forwards Jesper Bratt (eight years, $7.875 million AAV) and Timo Meier (eight years, $8.8 million AAV); Ducks forwards Troy Terry (seven years, $7 million AAV) and Trevor Zegras (three years, $5.75 million AAV); Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson (eight years, $8.05 million AAV); Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson (seven years, $6.5 million AAV); Red Wings winger Alex DeBrincat (four years, $7.875 million AAV); Hurricanes center Sebastian Aho (eight years, $9.75 million AAV); and Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin (eight years, $8.25 million AAV).\nThe situation between Mike Babcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets presented an existential question for hockey fans: Is it really a coaching change if a new coach never actually makes it to training camp?\nBabcock was officially hired by the Blue Jackets in July on a two-year deal worth $4 million per season, to much fanfare from the team.\nHe had won a Stanley Cup with Detroit, two Olympic golds with Team Canada, and is 12th all-time with 700 wins. But after he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, stories emerged about Babcock's mental abuse of players with the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. His tactics would be under scrutiny as he returned to the NHL.\nOn the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast in September, former NHL player and current TV analyst Paul Bissonnette claimed that Babcock asked Columbus captain Boone Jenner to show him his cellphone camera roll before displaying those photos via AirPlay on the coach's office wall.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nFormer NHL defenseman Mike Commodore, who played for Babcock and has been a long-standing critic of the coach, said he heard this behavior also occurred during Babcock's time coaching the Maple Leafs.\n\"It happened with a few other players in Columbus, too,\" Commodore said in a video posted to X. \"I don't want to use any names, but in particular [it involved] a young, very highly touted prospect.\"\nThese claims were enough to spark an NHLPA investigation of the situation, as new executive director Marty Walsh interviewed Blue Jackets players in Columbus. The NHLPA then presented its findings to the NHL, and the two entities informed the Blue Jackets. On Sept. 17, Babcock resigned as head coach of the Blue Jackets days before the start of training camp, with associate coach Pascal Vincent taking over as head coach.\n\"Upon reflection, it has become clear that continuing as head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets was going to be too much of a distraction,\" Babcock said in a statement released by the team.\nBlue Jackets management took the blame for the debacle. \"We went through a process earlier this summer prior to hiring Mike Babcock as our head coach, but we got it wrong and that's on us,\" team president John Davidson said.\nIn other less contentious NHL coaching moves, the Capitals parted ways with Peter Laviolette, who quickly found a new gig coaching the Rangers after they fired Gerard Gallant. The Capitals hired 44-year-old Leafs assistant Spencer Carbery. The Predators hired Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette, who was a Jack Adams finalist in 2022 with Florida. Ryan Huska replaced Darryl Sutter in Calgary, while Greg Cronin took over for Dallas Eakins in Anaheim.\nThe NHL has three outdoor games scheduled for the 2023-24 season:\nThe Oilers and Flames play at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL Edmonton Elks, in the Heritage Classic on Oct. 29.\nThe Kraken host the Golden Knights in the 2024 Winter Classic at T-Mobile Stadium, home the Seattle Mariners, on Jan. 1.\nMetLife Stadium -- which saw both a Taylor Swift concert and Taylor Swift, Chiefs fan, this year -- hosts another historic event in February 2024. The Devils will host the Flyers on Saturday, Feb. 17, in an outdoor night game. The Islanders will host the Rangers on Sunday, Feb. 18. The event will mark the first time four NHL teams have played outdoor games at the same venue in front of fans.\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend will be held on Feb. 2 and 3 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\nThe 26-year-old Edmonton star set new career highs with 64 goals and 153 points in 82 games last season, winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP for the third time and the Pearson Award for NHLPA player of the year for a fourth time. His point total jumped by 30 and his goals by 20 year over year. No one's really sure what his ceiling is statistically.\nUnfortunately for McDavid and his superstar teammate Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers have had a ceiling in the playoffs. After losing in the conference finals last season, Edmonton fell to the Golden Knights in the second round this season. McDavid and Draisaitl have yet to play for a Stanley Cup since McDavid entered the league in 2015. Is this the year?\nWhile teams like the Avalanche, Golden Knights, Lightning, Penguins and Kings seek another championship after recently winning the Cup, other teams considered among the top contenders are seeking to end significant droughts.\nThe Hurricanes (2006), Devils (2003), Stars (1999), Rangers (1994) and Oilers (1990) all have gone well over a decade without hoisting hockey's grail, while teams like the Minnesota Wild and Panthers have never won the Cup.\nAnd then there are the Maple Leafs, seeking their first Stanley Cup win since 1967 -- a 55-season drought that's the longest in the NHL.\nFinally, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin continues his journey to break one of the most seemingly unbreakable records in sports: Wayne Gretzky's 894 career NHL goals.\nAfter tallying 42 goals in 2022-23, Ovechkin has 822 career goals at the start the season. That's 72 goals to tie and 73 goals to pass Gretzky. So while the record-breaking moment probably has to wait until at least next season, it'll be fun to see how close Ovechkin can position himself to it during 2023-24.\nUnless he decides to score 73 goals and be done with it. We're never one to underestimate Mr. Ovechkin as a goal scorer."}

It all culminates with a \"Monday Night Football\" matchup between the Packers and the Raiders on ESPN. (Game times are Sunday unless otherwise noted.)\nJump to a matchup:\nJAX-BUF | HOU-ATL | CAR-DET\nTEN-IND | NYG-MIA | NO-NE\nBAL-PIT | PHI-LAR | CIN-ARI\nNYJ-DEN | KC-MIN | DAL-SF\nGB-LV\nThursday: CHI 40, WSH 20\nBye: CLE, LAC, SEA, TB\n9:30 a.m. ET | NFL Network | Spread: BUF -5.5 (48.5)\nStoryline to watch: While it's a Bills \"home\" game, the Jaguars are on the second of back-to-back weeks in London, which means Jacksonville has the time zone experience advantage. But the Jaguars will be challenged to slow down a Bills offense that's averaging 5.9 yards per play (fourth) while the Jaguars' defense is allowing 5.4 yards per play (22nd). -- Alaina Getzenberg\nBold prediction: QB Josh Allen will score a touchdown, and so will ... LB Josh Allen. Not a big deal if Buffalo's Allen runs for a TD -- he has 40 over his career, including two this year -- but Jacksonville's Allen has just one TD in his five-year career: a 37-yard fumble return that gave the Jaguars a 20-16 victory over Tennessee in Week 18 last season. -- Mike DiRocco\nStat to know: QB Allen had four touchdown passes last week, the 10th such game in his career. He is tied with Jim Kelly for the most in Bills franchise history. The last quarterback to throw four TD passes in consecutive games was Joe Burrow in Weeks 16-17 in 2021.\nMatchup X factor: Jaguars cornerbacks Tyson Campbell and Darious Williams. Jacksonville has a strong run defense, and if these two corners -- who both have allowed lower than average yards per coverage snap this season, according to NFL Next Gen Stats -- can slow down the Bills' passing attack, the Jaguars have a chance. -- Walder\nInjuries: Jaguars | Bills\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Jaguars' defense allows the second most fantasy points to tight ends. Rookie TE Dalton Kincaid didn't have a great game against the Dolphins, but he did catch four of five targets for 27 yards. He ran more routes and was more involved in the passing game than Dawson Knox. The stage is set for Kincaid to have a breakout performance.

Bills' offense chasing history behind Allen, Diggs ... Who has to step up for Bills after White's Achilles tear?\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: ATL -1.5 (41.5)\nStoryline to watch: Atlanta's home/road splits with Desmond Ridder at quarterback are stark -- 4-0 and completing 67.9% of his passes with four touchdowns and one interception at home, 0-4 with a 58.6% completion rate, one touchdown and two interceptions on the road. That'll be an interesting thing to watch since the Texans have allowed quarterbacks to complete passes at a high clip (71.9%) when they're on the road, although they've given up only one passing touchdown. -- Michael Rothstein\nBold prediction: The Falcons' passing attack will be held to under 110 yards and will turn the ball over multiple times. The Texans are one of six teams with more interceptions (three) than passing touchdowns allowed (two) and pressure quarterbacks on 44% of their dropbacks, the third-highest rate. Ridder has been sacked 16 times, fourth most in the NFL, and the Falcons average the fewest passing yards per game (156). -- DJ Bien-Aime\nStat to know: Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud has thrown zero interceptions in his first 151 passing attempts, the third-most passing attempts without an interception to begin a career in NFL history (Dak Prescott, 176, and Tua Tagovailoa, 152). Stroud will face Jessie Bates III, who has collected three interceptions this season (tied for the most in the NFL).\nMatchup X factor: Ridder. He has just a 29 QBR so far this season, and that's nowhere near good enough to get the Atlanta offense going. The Falcons need more from him if they are going to beat a frisky Texans squad. -- Walder\nInjuries: Texans | Falcons\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Texans' defense has done an excellent job containing wide receivers -- allowing the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game to the position. They do, however, give up the seventh-most fantasy points per game to running backs, so expect the Falcons to double down on the running game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Falcons are 0-3 ATS in their past three games.

Stroud will continue to be mentioned as a top waiver wire pickup.\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: DET -10 (44)\nStoryline to watch: The Panthers are still looking for their first win of the season but will have to slow down a potent Lions offense to get it. Detroit's offense has scored at least 20 points in 13 straight games -- which is tied for the longest streak in franchise history (1995) -- and could get another boost with the return of wide receiver Jameson Williams, whose suspension for violating the NFL's gambling policy was reduced last week. Carolina's defense has allowed at least 20 points in every game this season. -- Eric Woodyard\nBold prediction: Detroit QB Jared Goff will pass for a season-high 350 yards and four touchdowns. The Panthers will tighten up their porous run defense. However, they won't be able to pressure Goff, who is going against a secondary that's missing two starters (CB Jaycee Horn, S Xavier Woods) and could be down a third if CB Donte Jackson (shoulder) doesn't play. -- David Newton\nStat to know: Lions tight end Sam LaPorta has 22 receptions this season, third among rookies and third among tight ends. With three receptions on Sunday, he will be the third tight end with 25 receptions in the first five games of his career since 1950, joining Keith Jackson (29 in 1988) and Jordan Reed (26 in 2013).\nMatchup X factor: Panthers receivers DJ Chark Jr., Jonathan Mingo and Terrace Marshall Jr. Carolina simply needs more out of its wideouts, aside from Adam Thielen, to support slow-starting QB Bryce Young. Mingo and Marshall are in the bottom five in the Receiver Tracking Metrics' overall score among wide receivers (Chark hasn't played enough to qualify). -- Walder\nInjuries: Panthers | Lions\nWhat to know for fantasy: No team this season has eclipsed 90 yards rushing against Detroit, which has held opponents to 243 total rushing yards. The Panthers could rely heavily on Hayden Hurst, Thielen and Chark on Sunday. Against tight ends, the Lions' defense gives up the fourth-most fantasy points. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Panthers coach Frank Reich is 5-2-1 ATS in his career as at least a 6-point underdog. Read more.\nMoody's pick: Lions 30, Panthers 14\nWalder's pick: Lions 27, Panthers 17\nFPI prediction: DET, 77.1% (by an average of 10.2 points)\nMatchup must-reads: Why Panthers aren't panicking about Young, offense ... Reinstated from gambling suspension, is Williams finally ready to launch?  ... At 0-4, Panthers' offense, Young are failing each other ... Campbell sets realistic expectations for Williams\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: TEN -2 (43)\nStoryline to watch: The Titans have won five straight meetings with the Colts and six of the past seven between the clubs. The Colts' last win in the series came on Nov. 12, 2020, with long-retired Philip Rivers at QB. Additionally, the Colts have now lost seven consecutive games at home, their last win at Lucas Oil Stadium coming on Oct. 16, 2022, against the Jaguars. -- Stephen Holder\nBold prediction: WR DeAndre Hopkins will record his first 100-yard receiving game for the Titans. Hopkins' 65 yards against the Saints in Week 1 has been his best outing, but the Colts' pass defense has allowed 263.8 yards per game through four games this season. Indianapolis will be without starting CB Dallis Flowers, so Hopkins will have a prime opportunity to take advantage of the matchup against a reserve corner on one side and rookie JuJu Brents on the other. But he'll face a bigger challenge in the slot against Kenny Moore II. -- Turron Davenport\nStat to know: The Titans have scored fewer than 30 points in 22 straight games, the longest active streak in NFL and tied for longest streak in franchise history (22 straight in 1966-67).\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\nMatchup X factor: Colts running back Jonathan Taylor.

Meanwhile, the Dolphins have generated sacks on just 6.7% of opponents' dropbacks. Dolphins players and coaches have publicly stated that Sunday is not a \"get right\" game, but Miami's defense has an opportunity to right the ship against a reeling Giants offensive line. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nBold prediction: The Dolphins' high-flying offense will never take off against the Giants and will be held to under 24 points. New York played its best defensive game on Monday night and is sixth in the NFL with a 51.9% pass rush win rate. It will have some success creating havoc against a Miami offensive line that will be missing left tackle Terron Armstead. -- Jordan Raanan\nStat to know: Miami QB Tua Tagovailoa ranks first in yards per attempt on throws with motion, on quick throws under 2.5 seconds and on passes between the numbers. The Giants' defense ranks 24th or worse in all of those areas this season.\nMatchup X factor: Dolphins tackle Kendall Lamm. Lamm has filled in for the injured Armstead admirably with a 96% pass block win rate. Miami needs him to keep it up to keep Tagovailoa upright. -- Walder\nInjuries: Giants | Dolphins\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Giants' opponents have rushed for the eighth-most yards per game.

One major issue for the Patriots has been their turnover differential (minus-5), which ranks 27th in the NFL. One major issue for the Saints has been their red zone offense, which ranks last in the NFL with just four TDs in 12 trips. -- Mike Reiss\nBold prediction: The Saints will force two turnovers against the Patriots. While New Orleans' offense has struggled, the defense has been able to capitalize multiple times, getting an interception in three of four games and forcing a fumble in the one game without a pick. Patriots QB Mac Jones has thrown four interceptions this season, and the Saints are poised to get C Paulson Adebo back from injury, which could mean a prime opportunity for them. -- Katherine Terrell\nStat to know: The Patriots have the worst pass block win rate in the NFL (39.7%). And Jones is struggling throwing downfield -- he's 0-12 on passes of 25-plus yards.\nMatchup X factor: Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson. Which Jackson will New England get: the player who was a standout for the Patriots for years or the one who was a liability for the Chargers? The variance is high here and could matter quite a bit, given the Patriots' banged-up secondary. -- Walder\nInjuries: Saints | Patriots\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Saints' defensive front allows only 103.3 rushing yards per game. There is a good chance that New England's running game will get back on track sooner than later, but it is unlikely to happen against the Saints.

Pickett hasn't had a great start to the season, with a 29.3 QBR through four games, ranking 29th. But in last year's Week 17 win against the Ravens, he recorded an 82.5 QBR -- his highest of the season. Bouncing back against the Ravens' defense, though, is a tall task. The Ravens have allowed opposing quarterbacks to complete just 61% of passes and they've recorded 15 sacks, second most in the NFL. -- Brooke Pryor\nBold prediction: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson will toss four touchdown passes for the first time since September 2022. The Steelers are the only team that Jackson has thrown more interceptions (six) than touchdown passes (four) against in his six-year career. But Pittsburgh has allowed eight touchdown passes this season, which is the fourth most in the league. -- Jamison Hensley\n• Early mock drafts: Miller » | Reid »\n• Ranks: Kiper » | Positional top fives »\n• QB Hot Board » | Early predictions »\n• Projected draft order » | Read more »\nStat to know: Jackson has completed 74.3% of his passes this season, the second-best percentage in the NFL. He could become the first starting QB to complete 70% of his passes in each of his team's first five games since Derek Carr in 2020.\nMatchup X factor: Ravens wide receiver Zay Flowers. The Receiver Tracking Metrics make Flowers look like a hit so far. His 77 Open Score ranks eighth among wide receivers in 2023. That's a big help to the Ravens' offense. -- Walder\nInjuries: Ravens | Steelers\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Steelers' defense has allowed some superb performances to No. 1 receivers. Davante Adams, Nico Collins, Brandon Aiyuk and Amari Cooper averaged 31.7 fantasy points against Pittsburgh. Flowers leads the Ravens with 29 targets. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Steelers are 51-29-3 ATS as underdogs under Mike Tomlin (.637), the best record in the NFL in that span. Tomlin is 43-40 outright as an underdog.

The Rams have not allowed more than 400 yards in a game this season and are allowing an average of 295.8 yards per game, which ranks ninth in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop\nBold prediction: Rams QB Matthew Stafford will throw three touchdown passes, doubling his season total. The Eagles have yielded nine touchdowns through the air this season, third worst behind only the Broncos (13) and Bears (10). Stafford has a chance to light it up, especially if receiver Cooper Kupp (hamstring) returns to the lineup as hoped. -- Tim McManus\nStat to know: Rams rookie WR Puka Nacua has 39 receptions for 501 yards this season (both are the most through four career games in NFL history). He needs one reception and 43 receiving yards for the most through five career games.\nMatchup X factor: Kupp. It remains to be seen if and how much he'll play, but if he does, this will be our first window into the Kupp and Nacua offense. Given Nacua's breakout and Kupp's return, the Rams' offense looks much more dangerous than we thought before the season. -- Walder\nInjuries: Eagles | Rams\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Eagles' secondary has struggled this season, allowing the sixth-most passing yards per game. Find a way to insert the Rams' pass-catchers into your fantasy lineups. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: This is the 25th consecutive start in the regular season Eagles QB Jalen Hurts is favored in.

Arizona will try to keep it going against Joe Burrow, who has gotten off to poor starts all season and has been sacked eight times. -- Josh Weinfuss\nBold prediction: The Cardinals will rush for 175 yards. Cincinnati is 31st in rush defense (giving up an average of 157.0 yards per game), and Arizona is second in rushing yards per attempt (5.3). Combine those factors, and this could be a day for Arizona to make its presence felt on the ground. -- Ben Baby\nStat to know: Arizona QB Joshua Dobbs has thrown four touchdown passes and no interceptions this season. No Cardinals player has ever had five passing touchdowns and zero interceptions in his first five starts with the team since starters were first tracked in 1950.\nMatchup X factor: Bengals guards Alex Cappa and Cordell Volson. They rank 65th and 67th out of 67 qualifying guards in pass block win rate. Burrow is clearly not at 100% and needs better protection if he's going to get back on track. -- Walder\nInjuries: Bengals | Cardinals\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Bengals' defense has allowed the sixth-most rushing yards to running backs. Derrick Henry scored 24.4 fantasy points against Cincinnati's defense last week. The Bengals will now face James Conner. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Burrow is 27-18-1 ATS in his career but is 0-3-1 ATS this season. He has failed to cover five straight regular-season games.

The Broncos are last, or near last, in every major statistical category on defense. Their run defense is allowing 176 yards rushing per game, while the Jets have averaged 95.5 rush yards through four games. -- Jeff Legwold\nBold prediction: Hall will score two touchdowns for his first trips to the end zone since Oct. 23, 2022, in Denver. That day, he scored on a 62-yard run but was done for the season a short time after when he tore his ACL.

The player we saw in the second half against the Chiefs looked entirely different from, frankly, the rest of Wilson's career. Will he keep it up? I'm skeptical because the sample of him playing poorly is so much larger. But we'll see. Fortunately for Wilson, the Broncos' defense is a mess. -- Walder\nInjuries: Jets | Broncos\nWhat to know for fantasy: Even though the Jets' secondary is formidable, the Broncos have the best chance of attacking the defense with their running backs. The New York defense has allowed opponents to rush for the fifth-most yards per game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Broncos games have gone over the total in three straight and eight of the past nine games dating back to last season.

But will they dare use it against Mahomes, who, since the start of the 2020 season, has the NFL's best QBR (89.0) against the blitz? -- Kevin Seifert\nBold prediction: Mahomes will throw for 300 yards and won't have an interception. This type of game used to be a staple for him, but not this year. He has had only one 300-yard game and one without throwing a pick. But the Vikings are 21st in opponent QBR and yards allowed and have just one interception. -- Adam Teicher\nStat to know: Vikings QB Kirk Cousins has 11 passing touchdowns this season, the most in the NFL. He has thrown multiple touchdown passes in every game this season, the second-longest streak by a Vikings player to start the season since the 1970 merger (Tommy Kramer, six straight in 1981).\nMatchup X factor: Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison. Shut out on just a single target in last week's game, Addison needs to be a capable threat if the Vikings are going to keep up with the Chiefs' offense. -- Walder\nInjuries: Chiefs | Vikings\nWhat to know for fantasy: Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco has had the fourth-highest success rate (46%) among running backs since entering the league in 2022, according to NFL Next Gen Stats.

In a game where turnovers always matter, they take on greater importance when two talented heavyweights clash. Dallas leads the league with 10 takeaways, while the Niners have just one giveaway on the season, tied with Dallas and Seattle for the fewest in the NFL. San Francisco beat Dallas in the divisional round last season in part because it was plus-1 in turnover margin. It stands to reason the outcome in this one will ride heavily again on which side takes better care of the ball. -- Nick Wagoner\nBold prediction: Niners QB Brock Purdy will have a pass intercepted. He has not had a pass picked off in his past five regular-season appearances. He was not intercepted in the win against Dallas in the divisional round, either. And he is coming off a game in which he had just one incompletion. So why will the Cowboys have a pick? That's what they do. CB DaRon Bland is coming off a game with two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. The Cowboys have seven interceptions on the season -- only Buffalo has more (eight). At some point, Purdy has to throw one to the other team. -- Todd Archer\nStat to know: Purdy has torched man coverage, ranking in the top three in QBR, yards per attempt and touchdown-to-interception ratio since entering the NFL last season. He'll face a Cowboys defense that has played man coverage at the highest rate in the NFL since the start of last season.\nMatchup X factor: Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan is notorious for targeting opposing linebackers with his offense. Dallas will need Vander Esch to be on his game. Good news for the Cowboys: He has allowed just 0.2 yards per coverage snap this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats, which is excellent. -- Walder\nInjuries: Cowboys | 49ers\nWhat to know for fantasy: This season, the 49ers are allowing only 3.9 yards per rushing attempt. This might not be RB Tony Pollard's breakout game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Cowboys are 26-12 ATS in the past three seasons, tied with the Lions for the best record in that span.

The Raiders All-Pro receiver said it would be \"weird\" to look across the field during warmups and see those familiar gold and green helmets with the oversized \"G\" on them after spending his first eight seasons with the Packers. Now in his second year with Las Vegas, Adams needs one TD catch to surpass Antonio Brown (31) and Jimmy Graham (31) for the fourth-most TD receptions in prime-time games in NFL history, trailing Hall of Famers Jerry Rice (46), Randy Moss (44) and Terrell Owens (34). -- Paul Gutierrez\nBold prediction: Green Bay WR Romeo Doubs will have a better stat line than Adams -- if Adams plays -- on Monday night. Doubs has been compared to him by some in the Packers organization, and here's his chance to show it's a worthy comparison. Doubs' three touchdown catches are the most by a Packers receiver in the team's first four games of a season since Adams in 2018.

(1:10)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Washington Commanders limited partner Magic Johnson delivered harsh criticism of his new team following a 20-point loss to the Chicago Bears on Thursday night.\nAfter the Commanders lost 40-20 to the previously winless Bears, Johnson tweeted in part that \"the Commanders played with no intensity or fire. We didn't compete in the first half. ... It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing.\"\nTonight the Commanders played with no intensity or fire. We didn't compete in the first half and got down 27-3 heading into halftime. It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing 40-20.\nJohnson, who attended the game, is one of 20 limited partners with new owner Josh Harris. Johnson has been highly visible as part of the franchise, between charitable events and attending games.\nBut this was his first critical tweet of his new team. And the players did not disagree with his assessment. After all, Washington fell behind 27-3 at halftime.\n\"I'd probably say that's pretty fair,\" Washington receiver Terry McLaurin said.\n\"Definitely,\" defensive end Montez Sweat said. \"We came out flat.\"\nThe Bears scored on each of their five possessions in the first half, often because of missed tackles or blown coverages in the secondary. A defense that entered with two sacks recorded four. And an offense that averaged 298 yards in the first four games managed 451.\n\"We got our ass kicked,\" Washington defensive tackle Jonathan Allen said.\nWashington coach Ron Rivera said he couldn't repeat his postgame message to the players but that in short he told them, \"That's not good enough.\"\nThat's why no one in the locker room was about to reject what Johnson tweeted. However, some said there were other factors.\n\"I mean, that's perception when you're down that quick, it looks like that,\" Washington left tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. \"I'm not going to say the guys did not have any intensity or urgency coming into the game. I would definitely say it was a lack of execution early offensively; when they put up seven on the defense, we need to respond.\"\nMcLaurin said the Commanders' intentions, of course, were not to start that way. However, he said, intentions don't matter.\n\"It's what you put on the field,\" McLaurin said. \"I know we don't have a lazy bunch; I know we don't have a non-intense group of guys. That showing is not reflective of us, but that's who we are. We put that on tape. I'd say that's a pretty fair assessment [by Johnson].\"\nBoth teams were coming off difficult losses: Chicago had blown a 21-point lead at home to Denver; Washington had lost in overtime in Philadelphia. But one team was 2-2 and playing at home; the other was winless and traveling on a short week.\n\"I don't know if we thought they was about to give us the game,\" Sweat said. \"But them guys was hungry. They came out with more fire than us.\"\nJohnson has been complimentary toward the Commanders after other games. He lauded their effort against Philadelphia, saying he was proud and that he hoped that effort would be \"part of our DNA\" all season. He tweeted after a comeback win in Denver about his excitement watching the rally live.\nHowever, Thursday he opted for a different message -- one that was echoed in the locker room.\n\"When you don't get off to a fast start,\" McLaurin said, \"and a team that's hungry like that, fighting for every play, every yard and they're capitalizing, that's what can happen. The record didn't really matter. You don't come to play, that's what's going to happen to you.\""}

(0:37)\nUtah quarterback Cam Rising offered some clarity Thursday on why his recovery from a knee injury is taking longer than expected.\nRising, who has yet to play this season because of the injury he suffered in last season's Rose Bowl, said in an interview with ESPN 700 in Salt Lake City that his injury was more significant than he or the school led on.\n\"I wasn't really expecting to do this, but I just want to let everybody know I didn't just tear my ACL,\" Rising told ESPN 700. \"I tore my meniscus, MPFL, and MCL. It was a big surgery and it's not an easy comeback.

I'm grinding and doing everything I possibly can, and even the fact I'm going out there and practicing. I'm ahead of schedule.\"\nRising and Utah coach Kyle Whittingham had been publicly optimistic throughout fall camp that the star quarterback would be ready for the season opener against Florida. That never happened.\nRising was finally given clearance to practice without limitation in early September, but five games into the season, he has yet to appear in a game.\n\"I'm trying to make sure I can be out there because nobody wants to be out there on the field grinding with those guys more than me, but at the end of the day, it's my body. My body has to recover.\n\"I've just been focused on continuing to improve. I'm getting closer. I've got to keep making the days count.

(2:46)\nWhispers of the return of WNBA superteams started in late January as the 2023 free agency period opened.\nOn Jan. 28, the first domino fell. Unrestricted free agent Candace Parker announced she was headed to the Las Vegas Aces. The defending champion already was returning all of its starters from the 2022 title team -- including A'ja Wilson -- and now was adding a two-time MVP.\nOn Feb. 1, when players could officially sign contracts and offer sheets, the New York Liberty locked in Breanna Stewart in the biggest move in WNBA free agent history. Just 24 hours later, the Liberty added point guard Courtney Vandersloot. Those moves, after trading for 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones two weeks earlier, sparked immediate superteam talk.\nWith months to go before the season opened, many experts penciled in the Aces and Liberty for a WNBA Finals matchup.\nBut there were questions: How quickly would the Liberty get all the pieces put together?

The Finals will feature a trio of former MVPs, five former No. 1 draft picks and two of the best point guards in the world.\nAnd now, after the longest season in league history (the WNBA expanded its regular season to 40 games this summer), the question is whether the Aces will become the first team to win back-to-back championships since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-02, or whether the Liberty -- the last remaining original franchise yet to win a title -- will finally get their first?\nESPN looks at how the teams match up.\n😮‍💨 these are tuff @_ajawilson22 #RaiseTheStakes pic.twitter.com/hXUo6IYFgT\nA'ja Wilson, F/C: The Aces' centerpiece since arriving in Las Vegas with the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2018, she's already a two-time MVP (and almost won her third this season) and the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year for two years running. Indisputably one of the best players in the world, she has been unstoppable in the postseason, last month becoming the first player to score at least 30 points in three consecutive playoff games. She's averaging 25.8 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.2 blocks and shooting 59.5% in the playoffs.\nChelsea Gray, PG: Don't be fooled by Gray's draft slot; she has two titles on her resume and is known as the Point Gawd. After a knee injury cut short her senior season at Duke, she was picked 11th overall in the 2014 draft. She sat out 2014 and played just 16 MPG in 2015 for Connecticut. Gray was then traded and was a reserve on the Sparks' 2016 title team (she had a huge performance in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals). A regular starter since 2017 (when she helped lead L.A. back to the Finals), Gray signed with the Aces as a free agent in 2021. She was WNBA Finals MVP last season, when she averaged 21.7 points and 7.0 assists in the postseason.\nKelsey Plum, G: The San Antonio Stars selected Plum, the all-time NCAA Division I scoring leader, with the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft. She has been with the team ever since, most recently signing a two-year extension in 2022. After suffering a torn Achilles and missing the 2020 season, Plum has been better than ever, with her scoring jumping more than six points per game in 2021 over her 2019 averages. She was Sixth Player of the Year in 2021 and averaged a career-best 20.2 points during the Aces' title run last season.\nJackie Young, G: ESPN's Michael Voepel wrote last month that the Aces have one of the best guard trios in WNBA history, and Young completes the puzzle. The No. 1 overall pick in 2019, Young was moved to point guard early in her WNBA career, but has flourished as a 2/wing alongside Gray. After hitting 22 total 3-pointers over her first three seasons, Young made 50 in the 2022 regular season -- when she was named the league's Most Improved Player -- and 89 in 2023. A 25% 3-point shooter in 2021, she hit 44.9% of her treys in 2023.\nKiah Stokes, C/F: Drafted by New York late in the first round of the 2015 draft, Stokes played for the Liberty for six seasons. When they waived her in July 2021, the Aces signed Stokes and she played in all 10 of their 2022 playoff games. She's averaging just 2.8 points in the postseason, but she is a perfect complement to Wilson and smartly picks her spots. And Stokes' numbers are up across the board in the playoffs, where she's averaging 27.9 minutes (vs. 19.8 in the regular season), 8.6 rebounds (vs. 5.9), 1.4 steals (vs. 0.7) and shooting 54.5% from the field (vs. 43.4%).\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BENCH\nBad news: There isn't much of one beyond Alysha Clark. Good news: Clark was the No. 1 option off the bench this season. The 2023 Sixth Player of the Year is a relentless defender and two-time champion (she started every game of the Seattle Storm's 2018 and 2020 title runs). Over five playoff games, Clark is averaging 8.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 20.9 minutes.\nParker (9.0 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 3.7 APG, 23.6 MPG) has been out since before the All-Star Game, after surgery for a left-foot fracture, and isn't expected to play. Riquna Williams, a key part of the Aces' 2022 championship, hasn't played for the team this season. Sidelined early with a back injury, Williams was then barred from the team following a July arrest on domestic violence charges. The charges were later dropped.\nAnd then there were two teams left standing 🏆The 2023 #WNBAFinals presented by @YouTubeTV tip-off Sunday October 8th at 3pm/ET where the top seeded @LVAces will host the @nyliberty in Game 1 Tune in on ABC pic.twitter.com/7v8HIoa1iv\nBreanna Stewart, F: She simply wins wherever she goes. Four NCAA titles at UConn. Two championships in her first five WNBA seasons. So, can Stewart -- who won this season's MVP (23.0 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.6 BPG, 1.5 SPG, 46.5% shooting in the regular season) in the closest three-player race ever -- lead the Liberty to new heights after making the biggest move in free agency history? The No. 1 draft pick in 2016, Stewart personifies today's positionless basketball. Like Parker before her, Stewart can do it all, whether it's bring the ball downcourt, defend with a ridiculous wing span, hit the 3 or drive inside. Keep an eye on her shooting; she struggled in the first round and semifinals.\nJonquel Jones, F/C: The Liberty's superteam status wouldn't be complete without Jones' request for a trade from the Connecticut Sun. She was hampered by injury early in the season, but that has all changed since the All-Star break. She has had a double-double in every postseason game and is averaging 16.5 points and a league-leading 12.8 rebounds in the playoffs. As ESPN's Alexa Philippou wrote last month, Jones might be the X factor in New York winning its first title.\nSabrina Ionescu, G: This is the player the Liberty envisioned when they drafted the NCAA's all-time leader in triple-doubles No. 1 overall in 2020. Last summer, Ionescu became the first player in WNBA history to tally 500 points, 200 rebounds and 200 assists in a single season, and she's even more consistent in 2023. New York's leading scorer in three of its five matchups with Las Vegas this season, Ionescu can change the game with her 3-point shooting and ability to hit clutch shots in big moments. After COVID canceled the 2020 NCAA tournament -- where Oregon would have been a No. 1 seed and among the favorites -- is this the year Ionescu wins the 'ship?\nCourtney Vandersloot, PG: One of the game's premier passers, Vandersloot has plenty of options around her in New York and led the league in assists for the seventh time in her career with 8.1 per game in the regular season. Vandersloot, who like Stewart in February signed for well below the maximum salary available so the Liberty could have room for others on the roster, knows how to navigate a team to a championship; in 2021, she and Parker teamed to bring the Chicago Sky their first. Jones, Stewart and Vandersloot -- among other WNBA stars -- combined to help Russian club team UMMC Ekaterinburg win a crown a couple of years ago. Now can they do it in the WNBA?\nBetnijah Laney, G/F: Cut by the Indiana Fever after she'd already packed for the bubble season in 2020, Laney persevered, ultimately playing for Atlanta that season and tripling her scoring average to earn Most Improved Player honors. In the 2020 offseason, the free agent and former second-round draft pick then signed a reported three-year contract with the Liberty. As pointed out by Philippou, Laney has scored at least 19 points in all five of New York's postseason wins after averaging 12.8 points in the regular season. She's also hitting 43.8% of her 3-pointers after shooting 39.2% beyond in the arc in the regular season.\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BENCH\nEvery bench gets shorter in the postseason, but one of the biggest surprises with the Liberty is how much they've relied on their starters, all of whom played at least 37 minutes in the decisive Game 4 of the semifinals.\nThroughout the playoffs, the Liberty also have gotten 93.7% of their points from starters, per ESPN Stats & Information, which is on pace to be the fourth-highest rate in a postseason in WNBA history (minimum two games). That said, guard Marine Johannes (7.1 PPG in the regular season), forward Kayla Thornton and center Stefanie Dolson -- who was also on Chicago's 2021 title team -- have all made contributions throughout the season and made sure depth was among New York's strengths.\nThe @nyliberty are your 2023 WNBA Commissioner's Cup Champions presented by @coinbase 👏They defeated the Aces, 82-63 to take the crown for the first time in franchise history ‼️ pic.twitter.com/c6V8UXeBev\nThe Aces and Liberty met five times before the WNBA Finals:\nJune 29: at Aces 98, Liberty 81 -- The game marked the seventh consecutive win for the Aces. All five of the Las Vegas starters scored in double figures, with A'ja Wilson putting in 16 while Jackie Young and Candace Parker each added 15. Chelsea Gray had 14 points and six assists, including a few highlight-reel ones. \"They were a well-oiled machine today,\" Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said. \"We got to be more disruptive.

But they had never won hardware -- until now. \"That's why you play. You play to win,\" Stewart said. \"To be able to take advantage of these opportunities. ... You have this one game for the trophy and the money.

Wilson added 21 points, Kelsey Plum had 18 points and Young finished with 16 for Las Vegas. Ionescu hit six 3-pointers and scored 22 points for New York and Stewart finished with an uncharacteristic 13 points on 3-of-15 shooting.\nAug. 28: at Liberty 94, Aces 85 -- Ionescu scored 25 points and Stewart added 20 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists to help the Liberty beat the Aces in the final regular-season meeting between the teams. ″[We're] making sure that we're all aware that every moment matters,\" Stewart said. \"We have to make sure we don't miss opportunities ... it's the experience, it's having been in these big moments in playoff-type situations, and continuing to build off that.\"\nBecky Hammon and Sandy Brondello have their teams atop the league this season 👏 Who do you have winning the WNBA Finals? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/n4gF17brLS\nFor the first time, former WNBA players will meet in the Finals as coaches. Las Vegas' Becky Hammon made history a year ago when she became the first to win a title in her debut season as a head coach.\nFor New York, coach Sandy Brondello also has one title; her Phoenix Mercury won in 2014, and she led the team to the 2021 Finals -- only to be let go months later in early December. But within weeks, the Liberty had hired her, and less than two years later, her team is in the Finals.\nBrondello and Hammon have often been on opposite sides, but once upon a time Hammon played for Brondello in San Antonio -- which is where the Aces' franchise gets its roots.\nThe Aces are actually one of the league's original eight franchises. They started as the Utah Starzz in 1997, then relocated to San Antonio in 2002, where the team played until it relocated to Las Vegas before the 2018 season.\nAnd lastly, Hammon's playing career started in New York, and she was on the last Liberty team to reach the Finals, in 2002.\nAja Wilson is headed back to the WNBA finals and these are the vibes🤌🏼🥰 pic.twitter.com/qBFkEpCmMS\nThese two teams have been on a collision course since the Liberty made a few huge moves in the offseason to create a superteam stacked enough to compete with the reigning champion Aces.

{"title": "Why Lonzo Ball believes he'll play for the Chicago Bulls again", "date": "2023-10-06 13:38:59", "text": "Bulls guard Lonzo Ball talks about his rehab process and plans to play again despite a series of knee surgeries. (0:42)\nNASHVILLE -- A FEW WEEKS before the start of training camp, a Chicago Bulls executive flew to Los Angeles to check on Lonzo Ball.\nIt has been more than 20 months since Ball played in an NBA game, with three knee surgeries and a few devastating setbacks under his belt. And while what the executive observed from Ball as he completed his daily rehab process might have seemed mundane, it was notable.\nBall hasn't progressed to the point in his rehab where he has picked up a basketball, but the progress he has made, though small, gave the 2017 No. 2 overall pick the confidence to declare he will \"definitely\" play again.\n\"After the other surgeries, this one has definitely gone the best as far as [the] recovery process,\" Ball told ESPN outside the training room while the rest of the team began training camp in Nashville this week. \"The last two rehab processes I had, I was getting better and then it just hit a standstill and it started going down. And I haven't hit that yet.\"\nBall is finally getting through his rehab process -- starting on the training table, an intense stretching routine, followed by mobility and strength work -- without the lingering pain and discomfort that had plagued him since the start of 2022.\n\"Honestly, being out for as long as I've been out and all the injuries I have to deal with I think you just have to be positive,\" he said. \"First and foremost. If you lose your mind, you're going to lose the battle. So it always starts with being positive and hoping for the best.\"\nBall has been hoping for the best since Jan. 14, 2022, when he checked out of the fourth quarter of a blowout loss to the Golden State Warriors, the last time he saw action in an NBA game.\nIf and when Ball returns -- he has already been ruled out for the 2023-24 season, but is targeting a 2024-25 return -- he will have missed more than 1,000 days of action. Returning from such an absence to be a productive player is incredibly rare. Still, Ball, who will turn 26 later this month, isn't discouraged by the history or the long odds.\n\"It's motivation for me because there's been people that have been counted out,\" Ball said. \"For me, it's about getting back and doing what I want to do and love to do, which is play basketball.\"\nBALL HAS KNOWN he would play basketball professionally since at least the seventh grade.\nHis father, LaVar, made sure his three sons -- Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo -- were always competing against older kids until the trio reached high school. Lonzo and LaMelo dominated high school basketball, going 35-0 at Chino Hills in 2016, winning a state title and ranking No. 1 in the nation.\nHowever, Lonzo Ball's first five NBA seasons (two with the Los Angles Lakers before being traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in 2019, then joining the Bulls via sign-and-trade in 2021) have been slowed by injuries. And while he had arthroscopic knee surgery before training camp in 2018, he has never before gone this long without playing basketball.\n\"That's been the hardest part, not being able physically to play,\" Ball said. \"It's hard for me to watch the games honestly because I know what I can do out there, and the fact that I literally can't help on the court, it's hard for me to deal with. ... But just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that if I keep getting better and putting the work in, I'll be able to play again.\"\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBall still watches his share of basketball, especially games including his brothers (LaMelo stars for the Charlotte Hornets, and LiAngelo plays for their G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm), but for the most part, Ball has dealt with his time away from basketball internally, mostly leaning on his family and friends to stay grounded.\n\"He's had to go through this on his own a lot,\" Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who tore the ACL in his left knee in 2017, told ESPN. \"That's what injuries are. It's in between the ears. That's how you keep yourself going.\n\"As a friend and as a teammate, I just try to help him whenever he asks. He's a guy that doesn't ask for a lot. You can tell, he doesn't want to rely on other people.\"\nInstead, Ball has turned to hobbies off the court to fill the time basketball once occupied. He's playing video games for the first time -- some NBA 2K, but mostly Madden -- and is working on a documentary on his high school team that went 35-0. But mainly, he has started writing music again.\nBall released a few rap tracks earlier in his career and even competed on \"The Masked Singer,\" but he hadn't dropped any new music since 2020. Now, during his time away from basketball, he has found solace in music again, producing songs to fit the documentary.\n\"I like to write,\" he said. \"Whether it's in my notes, on my computer, on my iPad, I'm always writing something.\n\"It's just like a release. As far as music for sure. I get to just write about what's happened in my past and what I see with my own two eyes and just put it on paper. It helps me get stuff out.\"\nWHEN THE BULLS brought Ball in during the 2021 offseason to team up with LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, they envisioned a high-powered offense that would lead them to the top of the Eastern Conference. And for a brief moment, that's exactly what they got.\nChicago started the 2021-22 season 27-13 and led the East by a game over the Miami Heat when Ball last played. With him out of the lineup, they lost four of the next five games to drop out of first place, and slid all the way to sixth by the end of the season.\nBall first had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee in 2022 with an initial return timeline of six to eight weeks. When his knee did not improve, he underwent a second surgery in September 2022 near the start of training camp.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nLast year, amid season-long uncertainty about whether Ball would be able to return, the Bulls battled just to reach the play-in tournament, where they fell to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Heat in the game for the eighth seed. In March, Ball underwent a cartilage transplant surgery on his left knee, which resulted in him being ruled out for all of 2023-24 as well.\n\"We all know how much we love and miss Lonzo,\" LaVine said. \"You can't replace a guy like that.\"\nAlthough the Bulls remain optimistic, sources said the organization is still unsure if Ball will ever play for them again, knowing he still has a long way to go in his rehab process. But his progress following this most recent surgery has given all parties involved reason for hope.\n\"It's good to see him in good spirits because it's never a good thing when you have somebody that's that talented and basketball is taken away from you,\" LaVine said. \"To see him working his way back, being around the team, seeing him in the weight room, seeing him on the court doing things, it's a sight for sore eyes.\"\nThe last two players to go more than 1,000 days between games are Emeka Okafor and Greg Oden, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information, and neither played even 30 games in the lone season they played after their returns.\nThe most optimistic comparison for Ball is perhaps Bill Walton, who was a two-time All-Star and NBA MVP by the time injuries forced him to miss three out of four seasons, including more than 900 days in a row at one point. Walton came back to play 245 games after missing all that time, including 80 games in 1985-86 (when he won Sixth Man of the Year honors), and played his final game at age 34.\nKlay Thompson missed two whole seasons because of knee and Achilles injuries before returning in 2021-22, then leading the NBA in 3-point field goals in 2022-23. Shaun Livingston suffered a devastating knee injury while playing for the LA Clippers in 2007, when he was 21 years old.

Despite not being able to participate in basketball activities, he joined the team in Nashville and plans to split time rehabbing between Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\"Any step positive for him promotes a better outlook,\" DeRozan told ESPN. \"He's been the most positive a person can be through this whole process of taking away something he was so great at for these last couple years. ... Even the other day on the team plane, you realized how much we even missed him: being the DJ, playing cards, laughing, joking, talking s---. You miss that. Just to see him in rare form like that means a lot.\"\nAnd while it might come as a surprise, maintaining that positive outlook, even in the face of such an extended absence, has come naturally to Ball.\n\"That maybe sounds hard, but for me at the end of the day, I know that I'm still very blessed and I'm still better off than a lot of people in the world,\" he said. \"I can't complain about the injuries that I've had. I still have a great life. A lot of my family is healthy. Besides basketball, there's no real struggles in my life and I'm just blessed for that.\""}
{"title": "Fields, Moore break out as Bears snap 14-game losing streak", "date": "2023-10-06 13:40:05", "text": "DJ Moore tallies eight receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns in the Bears' victory over the Commanders. (1:10)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears put on a first-half show against the Washington Commanders in a 40-20 win at FedEx Field on Thursday.\nFields threw for three touchdowns in the opening two quarters -- two to DJ Moore and one to Cole Kmet -- to help the Bears to a 27-3 lead at halftime.\nThe Commanders opened the second half with a touchdown on their first drive, but the deficit proved too big as the Bears held on to snap a franchise-worst 14-game losing streak that dated back to last season.\nThe win moved Chicago to 1-4 on the season. Washington dropped to 2-3 with the loss.\nThe Bears had enough of the negativity, of the outside noise, of the heartbreak they had endured for 11 straight months. On a short week with no time to waste on distractions, Chicago ended its 14-game losing streak and beat the Commanders on the road.\nLast week, Fields felt the Bears' offense was finally beginning to show its identity. After a lightning-fast start and third-quarter lull, Chicago showed it could finally put away an opponent and leave nothing in doubt in the final minutes of the game.\nOne week after giving up 21 points en route to a devastating loss, the Bears' 20-point win is tied for the fourth largest in NFL history by a team entering on a double-digit losing streak.\nBuy/sell a breakout performance: DJ Moore found the end zone on two of Chicago's five scoring drives in the first half. His Randy Moss-like catch over Commanders cornerback Kendall Fuller and first-half stat line (five catches, 137 yards, 2 TDs ) helped the Bears build a 24-point lead going into the half and even had LeBron James marveling at the receiver's explosiveness on X. Moore's fourth-quarter touchdown -- his third of the game -- put the game away for Chicago on a night when he notched the second-most receiving yards in a game (230) by a Bears receiver.\nEncouraging trend: The Bears sacked Commanders QB Sam Howell five times -- which is great considering the team had only two sacks in its four previous games -- but two of those were generated by linebacker T.J. Edwards and cornerback Greg Stroman Jr. (who also recorded the team's first interception of the season against a starting quarterback). Chicago remains committed to pressuring with its four down linemen, but the line didn't break through until Yannick Ngakoue brought down Howell on second-and-9 in the fourth quarter. DeMarcus Walker and Rasheem Green recorded two more sacks late.\nQB breakdown: Fields became the first Bears quarterback to throw for three or more touchdowns in back-to-back games since the 1970 merger. He built upon his three good quarters against the Denver Broncos and has completed 43 of 64 pass attempts for 617 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception in his past two games, complete with a 131.2 passer rating. Most importantly, Fields didn't let a slow start to the second half hinder him from putting the game away when he found Moore for a 56-yard touchdown with 4:18 to play.\nNext game: vs. Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)\nThe Commanders' defense was supposed to provide a foundation while their offense matured. Instead, the defense sabotaged yet another game.\nThe Commanders allowed at least 30 points for a fourth consecutive game in losing to the Chicago Bears 40-20 on Thursday night. The Commanders (2-3) have lost three consecutive games, including their past two home games by a combined 77-23 score.\nIt's one thing to lose at home to Buffalo; it's another to lose at home to previously winless Chicago. Considering the Commanders have a young quarterback in Howell, the defense needed to provide a lot more. Instead, it gives up big plays and has not caused a turnover in the past two games.\nThe defense talked all offseason and summer about starting fast, knowing that the unit added only one new starter in linebacker Cody Barton, in addition to first-round corner Emmanuel Forbes. But the Commanders have been bad. Thursday, they allowed an offense that ranked 21st entering the game in both points and yards to score a season-high 40 points and gain 451 yards. Washington needs to make it work with this group. It had a chance to gain momentum with upcoming games at Atlanta and the New York Giants. Instead the team exits this game with many questions about its defense -- and its future.\nTroubling trend: Washington's defense continues to allow too many big plays. The Commanders entered having allowed 13 plays of 25 yards or more, tied for worst in the NFL. Then they allowed three more in the first half alone Thursday night en route to a 27-3 deficit. A huge culprit has been a secondary that has looked inconsistent. Rookie Emmanuel Forbes, who was benched in the second half, has struggled mightily allowing big plays. There were, once more, big gaps in coverage that Fields exploited.\nTroubling trend, part 2: Poor pass protection. This has been another season-long problem as Howell was sacked five more times, giving him 29 for the season. The Bears, who entered with two sacks in four games, applied consistent pressure with four-man rushes and blitzes. Some of the problems stem from Howell needing to progress through his reads quicker. But the line has been too inconsistent in this area and needs to provide more help for a quarterback who now has six starts to his résumé.\nQB breakdown: Howell's growth remains pivotal to the franchise's future. Howell showed, once more, that he's a resilient and tough quarterback. After a rough first half -- 9-for-13, 71 yards and an interception -- he threw for 298 yards in the second half. He moved well in the pocket, was patient with underneath throws, and though the Commanders lost, he continued to show he can be developed. Speeding up his progressions and learning to protect himself from hits should be points of emphasis going forward.\nNext game: at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)"}

How about all of that you just read, plus a game location of Dallas because Big D was seen as the perfect Red River DMZ, located almost exactly halfway between the two campuses in Austin, Texas, and Norman, Oklahoma. And then there is that seating configuration. The Cotton Bowl is split exactly down the middle, the 50-yard line acting as a Bowie knife, evenly dividing the 92,100-seat oval into equal halves of UT burnt orange and OU crimson and cream. That leaves entire sections of hundreds of fans left sitting with their shoulders mashed and colors clashed for four hours in the Texas heat. As former Horns head coach Mack Brown once explained: \"It's not like your home crowd or your away crowd, where it's loud for you and quiet for the opponent. In this game, somebody is screaming every play.\"\nSpencer Rattler loses the football right into the hands of Texas linebacker Juwan Mitchell. Sam Ehlinger would score for the Longhorns on the ensuing drive.\nYou want a heart-stopper? Just go back and watch the highlights of this game over the past decade alone. From 2014 through 2021, the largest margin of victory was eight points and the average score over eight contests was Oklahoma 36, Texas 32. Heck, just watch that eight-point game. The 2020 contest was an anti-'76 affair that stretched into four overtimes and was played for nearly five hours before former Sooners QB Spencer Rattler -- who had been benched earlier in the game for fumbling -- threw a TD pass to Drake Stoops, son of former Sooners head coach Bob Stoops, to win the game 53-45. Or, if you want to take that question literally, you could step outside the stadium gates and directly into the Texas State Fair, the event that envelopes the Cotton Bowl and this game, and choke down a basket of deep-fried cheesy crab tater bites or a plate of deep-fried honey butter brisket swirls. My Crestor bottle started vibrating just by me typing that.\nFrom Darrell Royal and Bud Wilkinson to Billy Sims and Earl Campbell to Ricky Williams and Baker Mayfield and, yes, this weekend with Quinn Ewers versus Dillon Gabriel in a battle of undefeated College Football Playoff hopefuls, every single time these two teams have met, the stakes -- and steaks -- have been scorching hot.\nBut this year, the official framing of the game comes with some sadness. As if a famous western wear store was suddenly closing shop. The end of an era. Texas and Oklahoma's last cleated steps in a long march together as members and co-anchors of the Big 12 Conference.\nONE YEAR FROM now, this game will be played again, just as it has been every autumn since the turn of the previous century. Only from 2024 and beyond, it will be an SEC matchup. Ever since July 21, 2021, when the news broke of the schools' joint decision to break ranks with the Big 12 and reach out to the SEC, collegiate athletics has been a never-ending Jenga puzzle, pieces pulled from conferences coast-to-coast and then jammed back into any available opening in any and every manner necessary to keep the entire tower from crumbling down. So many of those moves don't make sense. What they generate in cash they seem to equally lose when it comes to the valuation of regional relevance and tradition.\nThe banks of the Red River are certainly a long way from The Swamp of Florida or the Congaree River that flows by South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium on its way down to Charleston. But the two states whose shared border is drawn along that Red River also snap nicely into the left side of the continuous jigsaw map that represents the footprint of the Southeastern Conference. There are no gaps, from the Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico all the way into the Great Plains as they roll up into central Oklahoma.\nHowever, much more crucial than cartography is the calendar. The Red River Rivalry's streak of games played will not be stopped, unlike so many other rivalries that have at worst been completely sunk or at least been put on extended hiatus by the cold spreadsheets and shredded maps of realignment (*clears throat* ahem, Texas-Texas A&M).\nThis is not the first time this game has undergone an extreme matchup makeover. Yes, it has served as the centerpiece event of the Big 12, but only since 1996, when the conference was formed out of necessity during the first real lineup shakeup of college football's modern age. Prior to that, Oklahoma-Texas was not an in-conference matchup.\nFrom 1920 through '95, the Sooners were not a member of the Southwest Conference, a fact that would no doubt stump any younger-generation football fans at their local sports bar's trivia night. They were in the Big Eight, which had been the Big Seven, the Big Six and, in the beginning, the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association.\nTexas was a founding member of the Southwest Conference in 1915 and remained there until it collapsed in 1995 to give way to the Big 12. OU was also an OG Southwest member but left at the end of the 1919 season.\nSo, if you're scoring at home, and plenty of Sooners and Horns certainly are, then through Saturday, over 119 games played, the Red River Rivalry has been a conference showdown 33 times, five in the Southwest and 28 in the Big 12. That's only 28% of the games. The other editions of the game have been everything from a clash of independents to Southwest vs. Big 8 to SWC vs. MVIAA.\nIN OTHER WORDS, when one backs up and looks at the bigger picture, whether it be in black-and-white silver emulsion or gigapixel high resolution, the concept of OU and UT in the SEC doesn't seem all that strange, certainly when compared to the other incongruous college sports chess moves that will be taking place at the same time as theirs next fall.\nThe difference? This game -- in the minds of so many, the game -- isn't going anywhere.\n\"I don't need but maybe one or two of things in my life to still be there all the time so that I know it is still my life,\" explained Barry Switzer, who coached in 22 Red River Rivalry games, six as an Oklahoma assistant and 16 as head coach. His comments came in late summer 2021, not long after the news of the move to the SEC had broken.\n\"As long as that game is on that weekend in that place, I suppose I can make the rest of it work.\""}
{"title": "Allmendinger wins at Roval; playoffs final 8 set", "date": "2023-10-08 23:45:07", "text": "CONCORD, N.C. -- AJ Allmendinger spoiled NASCAR's playoffs by winning Sunday's elimination race on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where Allmendinger is fantastic and wasn't going to move over just because he's not part of the championship field.\nAllmendinger, who is in his first full season of his Cup return, led 46 laps for Kaulig Racing to win for the first time in NASCAR's top series since Indianapolis in 2021. Allmendinger, who became a father within the past month, was sobbing when he collected the checkered flag.\n\"Because you don't know when you are going to do it again,\" cried Allmendinger, who turns 42 in December. He said he normally gives the checkered flag away to a fan but was keeping Sunday's flag for his newborn son.\n\"That was probably the drive of my life,\" he said later.\nAllmendinger then went into the stands to pose for selfies with the fans chanting his name. It was the third Cup Series win for Allmendinger, who has raced across 16 Cup seasons but took a break from NASCAR's top series in 2019 and 2020. Kaulig slowly lured him back with five Cup races in 2021, all the way to this year's full season in Kaulig's second year fielding cars at the elite level.\n\"I hate crying right now, but it's a freaking Cup race, man. You don't know when it's ever going to happen again,\" Allmendinger said. \"This is why you do it. This is the only reason you do it. You fight. All the blood, sweat, tears. It's our second year in the Cup Series.\"\nAllmendinger won four consecutive Xfinity Series races on the hybrid road course/oval but wasn't entered Saturday for Kaulig because he's already exhausted his allotted five starts in the second-tier series. Allmendinger won twice in Xfinity Series, and it's unclear if he'll be in the Cup Series or return to the Xfinity Series next year.\nEither way, his win was pivotal in the playoff elimination of Kyle Busch, the two-time series champion who had to win Sunday to advance to the round of eight. Busch gave it a few tries but couldn't get into second place -- William Byron finished second -- and Busch settled for third.\nBusch was uncharacteristically optimistic after elimination and said he'll try to win each of the final four races.\n\"I would love to be the spoiler. That would be fun,\" Busch said. \"We've got our work cut out for us, but we'll keep building.\"\nAlso eliminated was Ross Chastain, last year's title runner-up, 2012 champion Brad Keselowski and Bubba Wallace, whose first playoff appearance ended in the round of 12 on his 30th birthday with 23XI Racing co-owner Michael Jordan watching from Wallace's pit stand.\n\"We weren't supposed to be here, according to a lot of people, but we proved them wrong,\" said Wallace, who finished 16th. \"... Got to continue to work. I don't think we're a winning car yet, but we're light years from where we were a few races ago.\"\nIt was a brutal day for Chevrolet, which lost both popular Chastain of Trackhouse Racing and a resurgent Busch, who won three times in his first season driving for Richard Childress Racing. He's been a boost to the organization, which won its last championship in 1994 with the late Dale Earnhardt.\n\"First year at RCR, means a lot to me for Richard having me and for the Chevy guys having me, everybody, to get this far,\" Busch said. \"Rides on me to get to the next round, so I've just got to do a better job.\"\nKeselowski knocked a Ford team out, while Toyota lost a championship chance with Wallace.\nMoving on\nThe remaining eight drivers in the championship race are led by Byron and Ryan Blaney, who both won in this round to earn automatic berths out of the round of 12.\nDenny Hamlin advanced in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing, as did Tyler Reddick, who drives for Hamlin and Jordan at 23XI Racing. Christopher Bell and Martin Truex Jr., the regular season champion, advanced with Hamlin for Gibbs to get three cars through.\nKyle Larson drove a backup car to a 13th-place finish to join Byron, who has a series-best six wins this season, representing Hendrick Motorsports and Chevrolet in the next round. Larson crashed in Saturday practice and Hendrick Motorsports, which is located about a mile from the speedway, had to work into the night to get a car through Sunday morning inspection.\nFord has Blaney of Team Penske and Chris Buescher of RFK Racing, which didn't advance Keselowski through but still has one driver racing for the championship.\nHamlin had already locked himself into the round of eight earlier in the race via stage points, so his last-place finish Sunday was irrelevant.\n\"We've already shifted our focus to Vegas and we'll see what we can do there,\" Hamlin said. \"Really optimistic for the next three weeks.\"\nUp next\nThe round of eight of NASCAR's playoffs opens Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Joey Logano is the defending race winner and Byron scored his first win of the season at Las Vegas in March."}
{"title": "How the Aces took a 1-0 lead over the Liberty in the WNBA Finals", "date": "2023-10-09 03:23:31", "text": "Aces outscore the Liberty by 20 points in the second half to take Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. (1:59)\nLAS VEGAS -- Coach Becky Hammon said her Las Vegas Aces gave themselves a \"D\" grade for how they played in the first half of Sunday's Game 1 WNBA Finals matchup with the New York Liberty. Hammon thought that might have been a bit harsh. The Aces were down only three points at halftime. She gave them a C-minus.\nBut when the Aces came out of the locker room, they turned things around into an A by Hammon's standards.\nLas Vegas outscored New York by 20 points across the final 20 minutes, at one point extending its lead to as many as 22 points, for a 99-82 victory to go up 1-0 in the best-of-five series against the Liberty.\nNew York, which is seeking its first WNBA title and playing in its first Finals since 2002, will try to even the series Wednesday (9 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN App).\nHow did the Aces turn it around? Let's take a look at what went right for the Aces, who are looking to become the league's first repeat champions since 2001-02, and what the Liberty need to improve in Game 2.\nMuch had been made about the star power in this matchup, including the guards: The Aces' Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young are former No. 1 picks (in 2017 and 2019, respectively), as is the Liberty's Sabrina Ionescu (2020). Chelsea Gray and Courtney Vandersloot will go down as two of the best point guards the league has ever seen.\nOn Sunday, Plum, Young and Gray were \"pretty ridiculous,\" Hammon said, combining for 72 of the Aces' 99 points while containing New York's backcourt as well: Marine Johannes had 14 points off the bench, but Ionescu and Vandersloot were limited to 17 points collectively. Betnijah Laney, who had scored at least 19 points in New York's five postseason victories, also had a quiet game with 11.\n\"They just had a little bit of a tough night,\" Brondello said of her guards. \"That's not going to happen two games in a row.\"\nWith so much attention dedicated to slowing down two-time MVP A'ja Wilson, as well as Gray running the point, Plum and Young believed they had opportunities to thrive. And they took advantage of them.\n\"How do you eat an elephant?\" Hammon said, referring to the problems Stewart and Jonquel Jones pose in the paint. \"One bite at a time, or invite your friends. So we invited our friends.\"\nHeading into the series, Hammon identified Young as the X factor, and the guard showed her importance early and often in Game 1, finishing with 26 points (5-for-8 shooting from 3), five rebounds, four assists and three steals. Her defense on Ionescu was just as important, if not even more critical: Ionescu had previously scored at least 22 points against the Aces three times this season, but she was held to seven Sunday (2-for-7 from field, 1-for-5 from 3).\n\"I thought [Ionescu] over the course of the five games that we had played them, she's been ridiculous,\" Hammon said. \"So I just challenged [Young] to take that head on, and they like challenges.\"\nChelsea Gray finds Jackie Young wide open on a backdoor pass to give the Aces a layup.\nThe flip side? The Liberty were a step too slow on the defensive end of the floor, whether it was allowing Young and Gray to get going from 3 or giving Plum easy looks at the rim. Las Vegas shot 54.7% from the floor, including 40.9% from beyond the arc.\n\"One-on-one defense was critical for us, and they got the upper hand in this game,\" Brondello said. \"We've got to make them work a little bit harder. There were too many open layups at the rim.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nNew York has greatly improved on defense over the course of the season, and had twice held the Aces below 70 points, but it seemed to lose traction on that end as the game progressed. The Liberty guards will have to step up here as well.\nThe Aces' second-half defense was \"as good as I've ever seen it,\" Brondello said, and their ability to get stops helped fuel their offense. New York saw moments when the ball stuck and movement slowed down, which allowed the Aces to thrive off clogging the paint.\n\"We just did it,\" Wilson said of the team's improved defense in the second half. \"We lost all the pressure. Everything was just off of our shoulders because we knew what was at stake. So I don't think we created any crazy scheme. We just did our job.\n\"And Becky always tells us, 'If everyone's doing their job at the same time, we're good in that space.'\"\nCoaches love the adage \"defense wins championships,\" and when it comes to a battle of two typically high-powered offenses, whichever team is better on the other end of the floor will likely emerge as champion.\nMarine Johannes hits two off-balance 3-pointers as the Liberty try to hold off the Aces.\nHammon said she's a fan of Johannes, whose one-legged, off-balance 3-point shooting was on full display in the first half Sunday. Johannes had scored only five points in the postseason entering the game, not playing as much in the earlier rounds in such physical series.\nThe Aces held her scoreless in the second half, but it'll be fascinating to see how the Liberty use her in the coming games, especially depending on what production they get out of their other guards.\nJonquel Jones nearly had a double-double in the first half with 12 points and nine boards -- a big reason the Liberty led at the half -- before adding just four points and one rebound across the final 20 minutes.\nLas Vegas won the battle on the glass (plus-6 in the second half), and the Aces' ability to contain Jones's production in both the paint and on the boards neutralized one of the greatest matchup problems New York boasts. Jones is the first player to compile seven double-doubles in a single postseason, but the Liberty will need a full 40 minutes from her to swing the momentum.\nFans thought they were finally getting a close battle between these two superteams when the score was tight in the first half, but the Aces' strong start to the third carried over into a fourth that didn't have much intrigue.\nBut if there's one thing Brondello stresses about her coaching style, it's that she never gets too high or too low -- and that's what she has tried to instill in her team all season.\nOne of the best examples of that: New York hasn't lost back-to-back games all season. Even after losing by 15 points in Game 1 of the semifinals against the Connecticut Sun, the Liberty rebounded to win three straight, including two contests on the road at Mohegan Sun Arena.\nCan that streak extend into Wednesday, against an Aces team that hasn't lost in the playoffs and is two victories away from winning another title?\n\"We're going to know that we respond in the right way, and I trust these players,\" Brondello said. \"And we're going to keep competing and fighting.\""}

Green with his 24th career receiving TD for Georgia. (0:55)\nWhile Oklahoma's thrilling victory over Texas in the Red River Rivalry captured the nation's attention, Georgia, Michigan, Florida State and Ohio State were reminding the college football world they're still here.\nAll won in reasonably easy fashion -- Ohio State struggled early -- to secure their spots in our power rankings. While Texas' loss dropped the Longhorns from last week's No. 3 spot, it's Notre Dame that took a big tumble with the loss to unbeaten Louisville.\nNext week should see another shakeup when the high-powered offenses of Oregon and Washington collide in a huge Pac-12 matchup in Seattle (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC).\nHere's how the Power Rankings play out after Week 6 results:\nSo maybe the Bulldogs are going to be just fine. Say what you want about Kentucky, but beating the undefeated Wildcats 51-13 felt like a statement for Georgia. On offense, Carson Beck tied a career high with three touchdown passes ... in the first half. And All-American tight end Brock Bowers eclipsed the 100-yard receiving mark for a third consecutive game. Meanwhile, the defense flexed its muscles by taking running back Ray Davis, who rushed for 280 yards his last time out against Florida, and held him in check to the tune of 59 yards and no touchdowns rushing. -- Alex Scarborough\nUp next: at Vanderbilt (noon ET)\nThe Wolverines' offense continued its string of strong games in a big 52-10 win over Minnesota. The Wolverines have scored 30 or more points in nine straight games going back to last season, which is the longest streak in program history. Quarterback J.J. McCarthy threw for over 200 yards with a touchdown through the air and added two rushing touchdowns. The Wolverines' defense contributed to the scoring as well, with two interceptions returned for touchdowns. It's the first time Michigan had two defensive scores on the road since 2006 against Notre Dame. This is a balanced team that is playing at a very high level through the first six games. -- Tom VanHaaren\nUp next: vs. Indiana (noon ET)\nThe open date following the dramatic win in Death Valley two weeks ago didn't seem to impact Jordan Travis and the Seminoles much as they collectively took care of business against Virginia Tech 39-17. Travis was efficient, completing 18 of 24 passes for 170 yards and two TDs -- both to Johnny Wilson, who left in the third quarter with an injury and didn't return. Florida State led 22-0 after the first quarter but saw the Hokies score the next 17, including on a 99-yard kickoff return to start the second half. But the Seminoles responded as Trey Benson had touchdown runs of 62 and 85 yards in the second half to punctuate a career-high 200-yard rushing performance. With the Clemson test now passed and the team 5-0 for the first time since 2015, it's all about getting ready for Duke (Oct. 21) and trying not to look ahead to Miami (Nov. 11) as the program looks to win its first ACC title since 2014. -- Blake Baumgartner\nUp next: vs. Syracuse\nThe gutsy, game-winning drive against Notre Dame that fired up Ryan Day and the Buckeyes wasn't the catalyst they hoped it would be. Ohio State looked sluggish after an open week, especially on offense without top rusher TreVeyon Henderson, and was fortunate to be tied 10-10 with Maryland at halftime after the Terrapins had the clock run out while in field goal range. The struggles continued after halftime, but Ohio State responded from a 17-10 deficit to score the game's final 27 points. Despite only 62 rushing yards for the team, quarterback Kyle McCord and his receivers gashed Maryland's defense in the final 26 minutes. McCord finished with a career-high 320 pass yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions, and the defense generated enough big plays from Josh Proctor, JT Tuimoloau and others. Ohio State will need to play more complete games, especially with Penn State visiting Oct. 21. -- Adam Rittenberg\nUp next: at Purdue (noon ET)\nA year after a humiliating 49-0 loss to Texas, the Sooners found some of their old magic, battling the Longhorns all game and letting a lead slip away before Dillon Gabriel put together a drive for the ages. He accounted for all 61 of Oklahoma's yards on the game-winning TD drive, including going 4-for-4 with 58 passing yards and stepping up into a pass rush to find Nic Anderson in the back of the end zone for the touchdown. The Sooners, who went 0-5 in one-score games last year, made a statement with three forced turnovers and an upset of the No. 3 Longhorns. The Sooners suddenly can see shades of 2000, when OU coach Brent Venables was a young assistant on an upstart team that made a run to the national championship. It's only six games, but the hope is back in Norman. -- Dave Wilson\nUp next: vs. UCF, Oct. 21\nThe Huskies had the week off ahead of next week's highly anticipated showdown against Oregon in Seattle. For USC, the winner of that game will be the de facto team to beat in the Pac-12 at the halfway mark of the season. The game also could be a springboard for Michael Penix Jr.'s Heisman campaign, which is off to a terrific start, but without a true marquee victory it's only ramping up. If he outduels Oregon QB Bo Nix, Penix could make believers out of those who might not have been paying close attention. -- Kyle Bonagura\nUp next: vs. Oregon (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC)\nThe Ducks have opted to use their first five games of the season to show just how much of a juggernaut they can be. Oregon has averaged over 51 points and held opponents to just under 12 points per contest. The dominant start hit a pause button this week with a bye, but what awaits the Ducks next week is an opponent befitting their potential. Washington is unbeaten, also coming off a bye and with a similar level of dominance in its previous stretch -- 46 points per game. Dan Lanning's team will have its hands full with Heisman contender Michael Penix Jr. and the potent Huskies offense in a matchup of top-10 teams with playoff aspirations. -- Paolo Uggetti\nUp next: at Washington (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC)\nA gifted Nittany Lions team led by one of the nation's best defenses recognizes its season likely will come down to two games: Ohio State (Oct. 21, road) and Michigan (Nov. 11, home). After a strong second half against Northwestern, Penn State had an open week to rest up before an Ohio State tuneup against UMass. The Nittany Lions are allowing just 9.6 points per game and 3.8 yards per play, while racking up 20 sacks, 37 tackles for loss, 6 interceptions and 6 forced fumbles. \"They know where we're ranked,\" defensive coordinator Manny Diaz told me. \"They know who's in our league, and that there are elite defenses in this league. So we can't sit around and act like we've got the market cornered because there's people coming up on our schedule that are side-by-side with us at the top of all these categories. So there's always more to do.\" Penn State wants a dominant and injury-free performance against UMass before gearing up for its trip to Ohio Stadium. -- Rittenberg\nUp next: vs. UMass (3:30 p.m. ET)\nWhen the Arizona Wildcats raced to a shocking 17-0 lead on a USC team that looked like it had just woken up, the game had all the makings of a classic Pac-12 After Dark upset. What's more: USC's defense had been bending the past few weeks, and Arizona looked determined to break it early on. It didn't help that quarterback Caleb Williams and the rest of the USC offense struggled to find any rhythm, but in the end despite their many flaws, the Trojans' talent won out. USC patched together a comeback of sorts, using bad Arizona penalties and a few stops to tie the game at 28. A botched kick to end regulation by USC kicker Denis Lynch pushed the game into overtime where, after three periods, USC escaped with a 43-41 win thanks to Williams' third rushing touchdown of the game. -- Uggetti\nUp next: at Notre Dame (7:30 p.m. ET, NBC/Peacock)\nThe Longhorns came out with some aggressive playcalling by Steve Sarkisian, including a fake punt that Jordan Whittington converted for a first down and a pass by wide receiver Savion Red on another fourth-down play, both on the same first-quarter drive, then blocked a punt for a touchdown. But down 27-20 in the fourth quarter, the Longhorns were stuffed on four straight plays from the 1 and came away with no points before rallying to take a 30-27 lead with 1:17 remaining. Then disaster struck: Oklahoma's Dillon Gabriel drove down the field in under a minute to toss a 3-yard TD pass to Nic Anderson with 15 seconds remaining and win it 34-30. It's a crushing loss for the Longhorns -- as all losses to Oklahoma are for Texas -- but there's a solid chance they'll get a rematch in the Big 12 title game in December if they can bounce back. \"I think this locker room is full of champions and our goal is to win a championship this year,\" Sarkisian said after the game. \"We've got to go handle our business.\" -- Wilson\nUp next: at Houston, Oct. 21\nUgly wins, especially on the road in the SEC, are never to be taken for granted. Alabama made enough mistakes to lose a couple of games Saturday, but made the plays that counted to hold off Texas A&M 26-20 at a raucous Kyle Field. Quarterback Jalen Milroe is starting to make more winning plays than bad plays and passed for 321 yards and three touchdowns against the Aggies. It was also a good sign for Alabama that receiver Jermaine Burton had a breakout game with nine catches for 197 yards and two touchdowns. The Tide needed a go-to receiver to emerge. The defense has been outstanding ever since the 34-24 loss to Texas, and the front seven was dominant at times and kept the pressure on Texas A&M quarterback Max Johnson. Alabama gets its next three games at home and heads into that stretch as the SEC West's only unbeaten team in league play. In other words, it's always premature to count out Nick Saban and the Tide. -- Chris Low\nUp next: vs. Arkansas (noon ET, ESPN)\nIt didn't take long for wide receiver Tez Walker (six receptions for 43 yards on eight targets) to get acclimated to the Tar Heels' offense after he was finally deemed eligible. He caught six passes for 43 yards in North Carolina's 40-7 win against Syracuse. Drake Maye and the Tar Heels offense was in perfect harmony from the jump. Maye picked Syracuse's defense apart, connecting with 10 receivers in the first half alone as the offense racked up 424 total yards, tied for the program's most in a half over the past four seasons. Nate McCollum led the way with seven receptions for 135 yards (103 in first half). Spurred on by Maye's precision (33-of-47 passing for 442 yards and three touchdowns), North Carolina finished with a season-high 644 total yards -- the third time it has surpassed 500 in a game this season -- while controlling the clock for 37:16. Maye's third career game with at least 400 passing yards has the program off to its best start since 1997, when it began 8-0. -- Baumgartner\nUp next: vs. Miami\nThe Cardinals used an aggressive game plan against Notre Dame quarterback Sam Hartman and it worked for the second straight year. Last year, Louisville forced him into six turnovers when he played at Wake Forest. This year, they forced him into three interceptions and sacked him five times in a 33-20 win that ended Notre Dame's record 30-game regular-season winning streak against the ACC. Jawhar Jordan rushed for 143 yards and two touchdowns and Louisville has now beaten AP Top 10 teams in consecutive seasons. The other one? That's right, Hartman's Wake Forest team. -- Andrea Adelson\nUp next: at Pitt (6:30 p.m. ET, CW Network)\nA week after winning a low-scoring slog against Utah, Oregon State responded by winning in a shootout against Cal 52-40. Quarterback DJ Uiagalelei completed 19 of 25 passes for 275 with five touchdowns and no interceptions. The Beavers piled up 499 yards of total offense in what was their most complete offensive showing of the season and comes ahead of an important test next week against one of the conference's best defenses in UCLA. Despite their loss to WSU, the Beavers should still be considered a conference-title contender in what is turning into a very interesting Pac-12 race. -- Bonagura \nUp next: vs. UCLA (8 p.m. ET)\nNormally, when you go three quarters without converting a third down, you've got problems. Normally, when your starting quarterback throws for only 153 yards, it spells trouble. But give the Rebs credit for finding a way to beat Arkansas when Jaxson Dart and the offense weren't clicking on all cylinders. They coughed up a 10-point lead and recaptured the momentum with a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the fourth quarter. But of course the real star of the show for Ole Miss was its defense, which held down the fort to the tune of 288 total yards allowed and only 1.2 yards per rush. Protecting a one-score lead with under two minutes to play, the secondary came up with its second interception of the night. With games against unranked Auburn, Vanderbilt and Texas A&M coming up, the Rebs have a chance to make some noise in the SEC. -- Scarborough\nUp next: at Auburn, Oct. 21\nWill quarterback Cameron Rising return against California after this week's open date? That's the only question that matters right now with the Utes' schedule about to get a whole lot tougher as a trip to Los Angeles to face USC and then a home date against Oregon in Salt Lake City close out their October slate. Utah ranks last in the Pac-12 both in total offense (297.6 YPG) and passing offense (153.8 YPG) and finding a way to jump-start things is a must for Kyle Whittingham's team to stay in a conference race that features three teams in the AP's top 10. The Utes' defense, allowing 11.8 PPG, has been asked to carry a lot of the load early, surrendering 13 or fewer points in three of their four games against Power 5 foes. That number is going to get severely tested if the offense doesn't get in gear soon. -- Baumgartner\nUp next: vs. Cal (3 p.m. ET)\nA resigned Jake Dickert had no choice but to call the UCLA defense the best in the conference after his team was stumped offensively on its way to a 25-17 loss -- its first of the season. The Cougars arrived at the Rose Bowl with another one of the Pac-12's (and the country's) best offenses, having averaged nearly 46 points per game through four contests this season. But while Cam Ward struggled to look anything like the player he had been in the previous four games, the entire Wazzu offense found no rhythm as it was forced into 4 fumbles, 2 interceptions and 9 punts. Dickert bemoaned how outmatched WSU was on the line of scrimmage, where UCLA's athletes dictated everything and controlled the game from start to finish. -- Uggetti\nUp next: vs. Arizona (7 p.m. ET)\nTennessee had Saturday off after an up-and-down early season. After a Week 3 loss to Florida, the Vols responded with comfortable home wins over UTSA and South Carolina. After riding to 11 wins with a high-flying passing attack in 2022, Tennessee has been Bizarro Tennessee this fall, winning with a dynamite run game and mostly strong defense. But the Vols will probably need some chunk plays from Joe Milton III & Co. if they're going to survive a three-game gauntlet through the rest of October. They host Texas A&M next Saturday, then travel to face Alabama and Kentucky. Can they shift into another gear? They'll need to. -- Bill Connelly\nUp next: vs. Texas A&M (3:30 p.m. ET)\nThe Blue Devils had a much-needed open date this week after not only a tough, last-minute loss to Notre Dame, but also an ankle injury to quarterback Riley Leonard that has him week-to-week. Duke has not been able to offer much more of a timeline than that because his return depends on how quickly Leonard responds to rehab. If he is unable to play next Saturday against NC State, redshirt freshman Henry Belin IV will get the start. -- Adelson\nUp next: vs. NC State (8 p.m. ET, ACC Network)\nThree straight physical games against ranked opponents proved to be too much for the Irish, who lost at Louisville 33-20, effectively ending their College Football Playoff hopes. Louisville was the aggressor all night, especially on defense, harassing Sam Hartman into multiple mistakes and slowing down the running game. Notre Dame had only 44 yards rushing as Audric Estime had 20 yards on 10 carries. Notre Dame was forced to throw more than it wanted to once Louisville took the lead in the third quarter, and simply could not get anything going. Hartman went 6-for-19 for 150 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions on passes thrown 10 or more yards downfield. -- Adelson\nUp next: vs. USC (7:30 p.m. ET, NBC/Peacock)\nIf there was any doubt the Bruins had the best defense in an offense-heavy Pac-12 this season, they showed it when they handed No. 13 Wazzu its first loss of the year. UCLA's menacing pass rush kept Cougs' quarterback Cam Ward on his back foot all day long as he threw two interceptions, and by the time the clock hit zero, the Bruins had held one of the best offenses in the country to 17 points and 216 total yards of offense. With a freshman quarterback in Dante Moore having growing pains (two interceptions Saturday), UCLA's defense has been the perfect complement, keeping the Bruins in games when Chip Kelly's offense struggles. After a one-score loss to Utah two weeks ago and a bye week, the Bruins are back on track and present a tough matchup for their upcoming opponents. -- Uggetti\nUp next: at Oregon State\nIt is hard to think of a loss as inexplicable as the one Miami just experienced. Needing just to kneel down to secure a win, Miami instead handed off and fumbled with 33 seconds left. Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King then led the Yellow Jackets on the game-winning drive, throwing a 44-yard touchdown pass to Christian Leary with 1 second left to stun the Hurricanes 23-20, ending Miami's unbeaten season. Miami turned the ball over five times -- quarterback Tyler Van Dyke threw three interceptions -- and lacked the type of cohesion and rhythm that it had before the open date. Next up is a road game at unbeaten North Carolina, so the Hurricanes will have to find a way to respond quickly. -- Adelson\nUp next: at North Carolina\nA 38-point loss on the road at Georgia stings, but it's not the end of the world for the 5-1 Wildcats. The key will be how they respond. On offense, quarterback Devin Leary has to find a way to complete better than 50% of his passes. And it might be time to find a complement to running back Ray Davis, who went from 280 yards against Florida to 59 yards against Georgia. The defense, meanwhile, has a lot of work to do, especially the secondary that was picked apart by Carson Beck in the first half. Missouri has a high-powered offense that will test Kentucky's resolve next week. -- Scarborough\nUp next: vs. Missouri\nIn the end, Jayden Daniels outplayed Brady Cook. That made the difference as LSU took down Missouri 49-39 in Columbia early Saturday. Cook threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns, and Mizzou bolted to an early 22-7 lead, but Daniels, with 259 passing yards, 130 rushing yards and 4 combined touchdowns, led a slow-but-steady comeback. His 29-yard strike to Malik Nabers with 2:58 left gave the second half its fifth and final lead change, and a late Major Burns pick-six sealed the deal. LSU's struggling defense gave up another 527 yards, but after scoring touchdowns on each of the first three drives, Mizzou managed just 17 points over its final 10. That was enough to flip the advantage in this track meet. -- Connelly\nUp next: vs. Auburn\nAfter three close wins helped to drive a 5-0 start, Mizzou ran afoul of the close-game gods. The Tigers led LSU most of the way but fell 49-39 after Malik Nabers' go-ahead touchdown with 2:58 left and a game-sealing Major Burns pick-six. Brady Cook threw for 395 yards and two touchdowns, Luther Burden III gained 149 yards on 11 catches and Cody Schrader had 114 yards on the ground. But Cook also threw his first two interceptions of the season, and the defense gave up 325 second-half yards. Mizzou couldn't make an early 22-7 lead hold up and fell to 5-1 because of it. But there's no time for moping: A trip to Kentucky, where Mizzou hasn't won since 2013, looms. -- Connelly\nUp next: at Kentucky"}

(0:26)\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks were hosting the Kansas City Royals in May 2022, and D-backs ace Zac Gallen couldn't help himself. He had watched a 21-year-old phenom make his presence felt over the field against his team for two straight days and wondered what it would be like to have a talent like that on his side.\n\"I saw Bobby Witt Jr. play and I joked with our front office, 'Hey where's our guy that's young, comes up and plays like that?'\" Gallen recalled. \"They immediately said, 'Just wait, he's on his way.'\"\nFour months later, Corbin Carroll arrived in Arizona -- and he hasn't stopped proving his front office right since. Now, under the bright lights of the MLB postseason, the rest of the baseball world is about to see what Gallen and his D-backs teammates have seen for just over a year now.\nCarroll was called up to the big leagues for the final month, getting his first taste of the majors and giving Arizona a look at what was to come when he slugged .500 with an .830 OPS in 32 games.\nThis season Carroll took his game to new heights. After signing an eight-year, $111 million deal during spring training, he blew past Witt's rookie numbers and became the first player in major league history to amass at least 25 home runs, 10 triples and 50 stolen bases in a single season. Add 30 doubles and stellar outfield play to his résumé, and Carroll is the runaway favorite for National League Rookie of the Year. He has risen to the occasion early in his first postseason as well, putting up an otherworldly 1.655 OPS.\nAs Carroll makes his October introduction to a national audience with every hard-hit ball, dash around the bases and incredible play in the field, we asked five of his teammates to describe what it's like to witness the emergence of MLB's next superstar outfielder on a daily basis.\nThe work ethic\nThe first thing Carroll's teammates pointed to was an approach to the game that far exceeds his age. The D-backs outfielder is often the first to show up and last to leave, but this goes even further: Carroll has already mastered the mental side in a way that impresses even a 16-year MLB veteran he's sharing the clubhouse with this season. \nEvan Longoria: \"He's so regimented. Everything he does, every day. He has a plan. He prepares the right way. I think of myself at that age, I had none of that. He's had that from the time I met him. That's part of what makes him so successful. Sticking to that routine. That's not easy when you're young in this game.\"\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nGallen: \"In 2021, we were losing 110 games and he was coming to the field, watching our games. He's learning the game while we're losing like that. He's so committed. Stomaching that season with us and taking what he learned into his career.\"\nLongoria: \"Watching him develop, he overcame any adversity very quickly. He was getting breaking ball after breaking ball and then went into the cage and worked on hitting those and the slump was short lived.\nThe tools\nCarroll was selected with the 16th overall pick in the 2019 MLB draft and rose to the No. 2 spot on ESPN's Kiley McDaniel's 2023 preseason prospect rankings, but in large part because of his unassuming frame -- Carroll stands just 5-foot-10, 165 pounds -- his dynamic skill set on the diamond still has a tendency to sneak up on you. The advice from his teammates as you take in the speedy outfielder for the first time this October? Don't be surprised by anything he can do -- in any aspect of the game. \nTommy Pham: \"He's a great player. He has every tool. I guess he could improve his arm strength? He covers so much ground. He can hit. He hits line drives everywhere. And the speed is so elite. He turns singles into doubles and doubles into triples. He's the best baserunner in the game right now.\"\nChristian Walker: \"Watching him play is so exciting. He's never too far down and he never gets too high on himself. He's just always in it. He's so intentful in every moment. You can tell that by talking to the guy. He's so smart and super talented. That's a great combination. He's the total package.\"\nLongoria: \"When I first signed, I went over to Salt River [Arizona's spring training facility in Scottsdale] to hit in mid-January, and he was there. The pop was electric. I knew he could run.\"\nThe leadership\nCarroll has played a grand total of 187 regular-season games and already been anointed the face of his franchise, rewarded with a nine-figure contract and put in the spotlight as the breakout star for a pop-up National League contender. That kind of adoration so quickly could go straight to a player's head, right? Not in this case, as Carroll prefers to let his game do the talking. Well, on the baseball field, at least. \nAlek Thomas: \"We grew up in the system together. To see him have this year he's having is unbelievable.

{"title": "Why Dodgers' pitching blueprint won't change -- even after Kershaw's Game 1 disaster", "date": "2023-10-09 12:34:08", "text": "Clayton Kershaw reacts to a rough Game 1 in which he could not get out of the first inning against the Diamondbacks. (0:26)\nLOS ANGELES -- The circumstances yearned for reassessment, but Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't entertain it. Clayton Kershaw had put together the worst start of his illustrious career, on the heels of a two-month stretch in which he was clearly limited by a balky left shoulder, but Roberts didn't deviate from his plan.\nKershaw, Roberts said Saturday night, then reiterated again Sunday morning, will make his next scheduled start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Game 4 on Thursday, if this National League Division Series even gets there.\n\"For us to accomplish what we want to this year,\" Roberts said, \"we're going to need Clayton Kershaw to start baseball games.\"\nAnd therein lies the vulnerability of these Dodgers, a 100-win team that is far from a juggernaut because of the uncertainty throughout its starting rotation.\nThe Dodgers went into this postseason looking to make up for a glaring deficiency with unconventionality, utilizing openers and bridge starters and a heavy dose of high-leverage relievers to piece together victories in October. It's a volatile plan born out of necessity, but its success hinged on Kershaw providing four to five quality innings on his start days. It's why the results of his Game 1 outing Saturday night -- six runs allowed and one out recorded, becoming only the fourth starting pitcher in postseason history with such a line -- were so concerning.\nKershaw is the only man remaining from the Dodgers' initial rotation of the season. Dustin May and Tony Gonsolin underwent season-ending surgeries; Noah Syndergaard struggled mightily before being traded away; Walker Buehler didn't make it back from his second Tommy John surgery in time to help; Julio Urias went on administrative leave after allegations of domestic violence; and midseason pursuits of Justin Verlander and Eduardo Rodriguez fell through.\nThe Dodgers knew Kershaw would be limited in the postseason, but they expected him to be effective. Upon his return from a six-week stint on the injured list in early August, they spaced out Kershaw's starts and shortened them to about five innings at a time. He delivered under those constraints, posting an ERA under 3.00 despite a fastball that was mostly clocked around 88 mph.\nThat, the Dodgers thought, would be enough for a pitching staff that would ask a lot out of a foursome of rookies that includes Bobby Miller, Ryan Pepiot, Emmet Sheehan and Michael Grove.\nNow the Dodgers don't know what to expect from their most accomplished pitcher.\nWe've got you covered on all things October baseball.\nSchedule, bracket, standings »\nWorld Series odds, LDS preview »\nOur predictions for every round »\nKershaw emphasized Saturday that his Game 1 struggles were not health related. \"Just bad pitching,\" he said. Roberts noted that Kershaw's stuff was relatively sharp; all 17 of Kershaw's fastballs were 90 to 91 mph. It's a source of optimism, but also, considering the damage levied against him by an exceedingly aggressive offense, a reason to worry.\n\"I think that's fair,\" Roberts said when asked if it's more concerning that Kershaw struggled despite an uptick in velocity. \"I would still bet on the stuff being good than the stuff being down and not sharp. So now it's how we attack these guys. It's a game of adjustments. It really is. I still stand by the fact that he's healthy. The stuff played up, and now we've just got to make better pitches.\"\nThe Dodgers have been as celebrated for their regular-season prowess as they have been chastised for their postseason shortcomings, most notably their division series exits at the hands of the Washington Nationals in 2019 and the San Diego Padres in 2022. Despite their standing as one of this era's most successful franchises, they have been panned for frequently falling short of expectations in October, a label that has followed Kershaw for most of his career. But the circumstances are vastly different now. The Dodgers are noticeably shorthanded, and Kershaw, 35, is seemingly not right.\nA longtime scout who watched Kershaw pitch frequently down the stretch said his stuff was \"about a third down\" over the last two months of the regular season. The metrics support that. Stuff+ grades the physical characteristics of pitches by factoring velocity, spin rate, movement and release point, among other aspects, with 100 being league average. Kershaw's Stuff+ from 2021 to 2022 was 110. From April to July of this season, it was 108. From August to September, it was all the way down to 83. In other words, 17% below league average.\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nOn Saturday, he combined that with center-cut fastballs and an inadequate feel for his breaking pitches.\nSaid the scout: \"Diminished stuff with poor location is a bad combo.\"\nMiller, the 24-year-old right-hander with electric stuff but no prior postseason experience, will take the ball opposite Cy Young contender Zac Gallen in Game 2 from Dodger Stadium on Monday night. Roberts said he \"couldn't even sit here and tell you what Game 3 looks like,\" though Pepiot and Lance Lynn tag-teaming two-thirds of it stands out as a possibility.\nAfter that, if the Dodgers win at least once, it'll swing back to Kershaw.\nThey don't have much choice.\n\"There's certain people that get you here that have to get you across the finish line,\" Roberts said, \"and this is his role on our ballclub.\""}

Won the Stanley Cup.\nStanley Cup odds: +1200\nKey players added: None\nKey players lost: F Teddy Blueger, G Laurent Brossoit, F Phil Kessel, G Jonathan Quick, F Reilly Smith\nMost fascinating player: Ivan Barbashev. The Golden Knights' trade for Barbashev provided a major boost to their Cup run, as he posted six goals and 10 assists in 23 regular-season games and another seven goals and 13 assists in the playoffs. He was slated to be an unrestricted free agent, and in order to keep him (he signed a five-year contract worth $5 million annually), they had to part with one of the remaining original Golden Knights in Reilly Smith. The Golden Knights are counting on Barbashev -- a four-time double-digit scorer -- to continue to be a productive two-way forward who can be trusted in all situations.\nBest case: They win the Stanley Cup for a second year in a row.\nWorst case: Falling short of the title, along with the reasons why. So much of the formula behind the Golden Knights' success was rooted in being multifaceted. They had the depth that allowed them to rely on all four lines and all three defensive pairings for offensive contributions. They had a defensive structure that saw them limit some of the game's most talented players to zero points in the playoffs, as well as the depth that saw players like goaltender Adin Hill go from being a member of the regular-season rotation to one of the main reasons for winning the Cup.\nX factor: Part of the challenge in being a defending champion is finding enough players on team-friendly deals who can serve in key roles. That makes what the Knights have done at the AHL level even more vital. Homegrown talents such as Nicolas Hague, Keegan Kolesar, Logan Thompson and Zach Whitecloud are proof that they've been able to develop key contributors on team-friendly deals. It was the case last season, when Paul Cotter, who did not see action in the postseason, still contributed 13 goals while playing in a bottom-six role. Cotter is expected to take on a greater role this season, and it's possible the Golden Knights could ask their next wave of homegrown talents to do the same.\nFantasy outlook: Jack Eichel appears in solid shape after a stretch of serious injury concerns. As demonstrated by his performance on route to winning the Knights' first Cup, the club's top center is more than capable of eclipsing the 85-point mark, while averaging close to four shots per contest.\nBold prediction: Logan Thompson reclaims the crease.\nLast season: 51-24-7, 109 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +900\nKey players added: F Ross Colton, F Jonathan Drouin, F Ryan Johansen, F Miles Wood\nKey players lost: F J.T. Compher, F Lars Eller, F Darren Helm, D Erik Johnson, F Denis Malgin, F Alex Newhook, F Evan Rodrigues\nMost fascinating player: Cale Makar. Injuries throughout the lineup forced the Avalanche to make adjustments. One of them was asking Makar to take on more, which is why he led the NHL in average ice time (26:22 per game), which meant he had to pick and choose his spots to attack. Having a healthier roster along with more secondary and tertiary scoring options could help Makar become more of an offensive threat. Injuries limited Makar to 60 games, but he still averaged more than a point per game, almost matching his output from the previous season, when he won the Norris.\nBest case: Winning their second Stanley Cup in three seasons is the mission for the Avs. They have built a core around Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen, Devon Toews, Valeri Nichushkin, Samuel Girard and Artturi Lehkonen, who were part of their 2021-22 title-winning team. Injuries and a lack of scoring depth were stumbling blocks in their bid to repeat last season. Like any Cup contender, salary-cap limitations forced the Avs to part with players such as J.T. Compher and Evan Rodrigues in free agency and Alex Newhook via trade. Yet like any Cup contender, they got creative with their cap space and made the necessary moves to provide more options to supplement their core with captain Gabriel Landeskog slated to miss a second straight season while recovering from knee surgery.\nWorst case: A repeat of last season, which saw an injury-riddled campaign end with a first-round playoff exit. Part of what also plagued the Avs was their limited cap space, which made it difficult for them to find replacements for Andre Burakovsky and Nazem Kadri, members of that Cup winning team that left in free agency. Trading draft picks for Ross Colton and Ryan Johansen while signing Jonathan Drouin and Miles Wood in free agency should give the Avs the needed secondary scoring and depth they lacked last season.\nX factor: Could it be Jonathan Drouin? Over the past few seasons, Avs coach Jared Bednar has found results with skilled forwards who joined the team in free agency or via trade. Burakovsky and Kadri had the strongest years of their careers with the Avs, while Nichushkin went from a top-10 pick who struggled to find success with the Dallas Stars to a key top-six forward. Lehkonen is the latest example: The former Canadiens winger finished with his first 20-goal and 50-point season in his first full campaign with the Avs. Is it possible that Drouin will be the next forward who strikes it rich in the Rockies?\nFantasy outlook: On the blue line, Makar remains any manager's choice No. 1 defenseman, particularly in leagues that reward power-play points at a premium. Third-year defender Bowen Byram is hoping his first full, healthy season results in a haul near 50 points.\nBold prediction: Cale Makar scores 102 points.\nLast season: 52-21-9, 113 points. Lost in Eastern Conference finals.\nStanley Cup odds: +750\nKey players added: F Michael Bunting, D Dmitry Orlov, D Tony DeAngelo\nKey players lost: D Shayne Gostisbehere\nMost fascinating player: Seth Jarvis. What's the ceiling for Carolina's up-and-comer? He has become a genuine driver within the Hurricanes' offense and plays with control yet the slightly reckless abandon of a skater who wants to keep up with the likes of Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov. Carolina has become known for playing a tight defensive structure and is often pooh-poohed for not being \"exciting\" enough up front. Jarvis can be a catalyst for change there. Now going into this third NHL season and with a solid foundation of growth to build off, this could be a momentum-shifting year for the 21-year-old forward.\nBest case: Carolina finally puts it all together and wins the Cup. Season after season it feels like the Hurricanes have inched closer to that championship version of themselves. For one reason or another it hasn't happened for Carolina, although it came close in making the Eastern Conference finals last spring. Even more impressive was the fact that the Hurricanes reached that stage without Svechnikov, who tore an ACL in March. Svechnikov is healthy again, and assuming he and the club's other top skaters stay that way, the Hurricanes could become the beasts of the East. Michael Bunting was a key offseason signing whom Carolina expects will bring a certain edge -- and skill -- to its top nine, and Dmitry Orlov is a terrific addition to an already great blue line. There's nothing standing in Carolina's way now, right?\nWorst case: More of the same: The Hurricanes dominate the regular season, start well in the postseason and then fizzle out. That would be the biggest disappointment of all. Carolina being swept by Florida in the conference finals was a tough enough pill to swallow. If that letdown doesn't fuel the Hurricanes' fire and propel them to something greater, what will? Carolina has too many good players, and too good a coach in Rod Brind'Amour, to keep letting opportunities to achieve their full potential slip away.\nX factor: Goaltending. Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta are both back and project to be the Hurricanes' tandem once again. Are two aging goaltenders enough for Carolina to reach that aforementioned promised land? Andersen had a strong 2022-23 as the Hurricanes' No. 1 (.903 SV%, 2.48 GAA), but that was only when the 34-year-old was available -- and not battling various injuries. It has been a pattern for Andersen throughout his career. But Carolina is counting on him and Raanta to keep them steady between the pipes. Will they be up to that task?\nFantasy outlook: The Hurricanes run six deep on defense, and the top question is whether Brent Burns can repeat again at age 38. As a backup, Tony DeAngelo returns to the club as a potential power-play specialist.\nBold prediction: Brett Pesce isn't traded.\nLast season: 50-23-9, 109 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +900\nKey players added: F Connor Brown, F Mattias Janmark, F Lane Pederson\nKey players lost: F Nick Bjugstad, D Oscar Klefbom, F Klim Kostin, D William Lagesson, D Ryan Murray, F Kailer Yamamoto\nMost fascinating player: Stuart Skinner. What Skinner does in the regular season will clearly carry value. That's how he was able to earn the starting job going into the playoffs. It's just that both he and the Oilers are now at the stage in which what's done in the regular season is overshadowed by what does, or does not, happen in the playoffs. Skinner's maiden postseason came with questions considering he finished with a 3.68 GAA and a .883 save percentage. Those were further amplified in the second round when Skinner was pulled in three of the Oilers' four defeats.\nBest case: Winning the Stanley Cup. This is the expectation for a team that has a pair of Hart Trophy candidates who have combined to win the award in three of the past four seasons: Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid. While it has been a gradual incline from the 2019-20 season, when they reached the qualifying round, the Oilers have done more to strengthen their case as a legitimate Cup contender. They made it to the Western Conference finals in 2021-22, and while their Cup hopes ended in the second round last season, their two most recent exits came at the hands of the teams that would win it all in the Avalanche and the Golden Knights.\nWorst case: Getting eliminated in either the first or second round. What further complicates the Oilers' championship aspirations is where they stand within the conference landscape. They're trying to win a Cup at a time in which the Avs and Golden Knights are the most recent winners, teams such as the Kraken and Stars believe this most recent postseason further legitimized their approach, and changes including trading for Pierre-Luc Dubois could get the Kings beyond the first round. Even then? What makes assessing the Oilers challenging is how recent Cup winners such as the Capitals, Blues, Lightning and Golden Knights all went through some sort of crucible before winning it all. Could that also be the case for the Oilers?\nX factor: How much of a difference will their tactical changes make? The Oilers spent quite a bit of the preseason installing a new neutral-zone system while also changing their defense from man-to-man to zone. One of the questions facing the Oilers throughout the offseason was how do they solve the defensive issues that plagued them in the second round against the Golden Knights? Fixing those issues became a concern given that the Oilers held a one-goal lead in all of their losses to Vegas. Especially considering that the Oilers were in the bottom five among playoff teams in shots allowed per 60, goals allowed per 60 and high-danger chances allowed per 60 in 5-on-5 play.\nFantasy outlook: Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (104 points) and Zach Hyman (83) aren't likely to replicate their outstanding numbers from last season, but still have the wherewithal to finish in the top 25 and 35 in scoring, respectively.\nBold prediction: The Oilers will win the Stanley Cup.\nLast season: 52-22-8, 112 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1000\nKey players added: F Tyler Toffoli\nKey players lost: D Damon Severson, D Ryan Graves, G Mackenzie Blackwood\nMost fascinating player: Timo Meier. It's time for Meier to spread his wings in New Jersey. The Devils landed a major prize in trading with San Jose for Meier last season and the forward produced nine goals and 14 points in 21 games for New Jersey after coming aboard. He dealt with injuries though -- in the regular season and again in the playoffs -- so it still seems like New Jersey hasn't seen all of what Meier will eventually offer its offense. GM Tom Fitzgerald got the business side taken care of when he inked Meier to an eight-year contract extension in June. That shows a commitment on both sides to see Meier shine for the Devils. How will that manifest now in the season ahead, when a more established Meier will be playing off the likes of Jack Hughes, Jesper Bratt, Nico Hischier and more?\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBest case: New Jersey is a Cinderella story no more. And that's a good thing. The Devils are just a good team, and they can parlay that into being a great one throughout an 82-game regular season. What's next after that? Playoffs. New Jersey got the satisfaction of beating their rival New York Rangers in a first-round series last April. Best case? That outcome again is just an appetizer for the Devils. Instead of tapping out in the second round, New Jersey wields its way to greater heights on the back of Hughes, Bratt and Meier dominating offensively while Dougie Hamilton & Co. lock down the blue line. Vitek Vanecek performs between the pipes and there's no dip in the Devils' production as they push their way well into the Eastern Conference playoff race.\nWorst case: New Jersey folds under the newfound pressure of being a contender. The Devils won't catch any team off guard this time around and their struggles will be amplified and harder to overcome than they were last season. Frustration settles in when their goaltending tandem of Vanecek and Akira Schmid can't stand up to the tougher competition and even more cracks begin to show. Eventually, the Devils succumb to their own demons and don't even reach the second round.\nX factor: How will New Jersey's blue line adjust without Severson and Graves? Severson was traded to Columbus in June and Graves signed with the Penguins as a free agent. Losing both leaves a defense gap with which the Devils will be grappling. New Jersey can expect only so much development out of Luke Hughes and there's a lot more riding now on Hamilton, John Marino and even Colin Miller to keep New Jersey's defensive game tight. They'll need help from the Devils' forwards, too. Getting beat too easily off the rush has been an issue for New Jersey in the past; if it remains one in their future, that could detract from an otherwise strong season ahead.\nFantasy outlook: Vanecek is the 1A starter, but Schmid showed flashes last season. The crease here should generate value regardless, so earning minutes will determine how much value they each have.\nBold prediction: Hischier wins the Selke Trophy.\nLast season: 50-21-11, 111 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1000\nKey players added: F Max Domi, F Tyler Bertuzzi, D John Klingberg, F Ryan Reaves, G Martin Jones\nKey players lost: F Michael Bunting, F Alexander Kerfoot, F Ryan O'Reilly\nMost fascinating player: Ilya Samsonov. What a revelation Samsonov was for the Leafs last season. Signed to a one-year deal with low expectations, the 26-year-old quickly took hold of the No. 1 job and turned in the best performance of his career. Now, after an arbitration hearing with Toronto landed him another one-year pact, can Samsonov do it all over again? His .919 SV% and 2.33 GAA in 2022-23 helped keep Toronto consistent right up to the playoffs -- during which Samsonov suffered an injury that sidelined him in the second round. Had Samsonov been available -- and had the Leafs not been forced to put Joseph Woll in against Florida -- would Toronto have come through that second-round series? Is Samsonov that much of a factor in their success? Could be.\nBest case: Toronto got over the proverbial hump by beating Tampa Bay in the first round of the playoffs last season. Check. Done. So, the Leafs must push forward into the next phase -- and that's being Cup contenders. Toronto has the talent to be a top-five team in the league year after year, and it is. The Leafs' best case is translating all that regular-season success (not to mention optimism) into the playoffs and not being overwhelmed by expectations. General manager Brad Treliving took one major potential distraction off the table by signing Auston Matthews to a four-year extension. And Treliving added some snarl with Ryan Reaves, forward depth in Max Domi and Tyler Bertuzzi, and a solid veteran defender in John Klingberg to bolster the back end. Change can do a team good, and that's what the Leafs are hoping for here.\nWorst case: Another crash and burn in the postseason. The recipe for Toronto is simple: Don't just make the playoffs; make the most of an opportunity when you get there. And that starts with building chemistry early on and sustaining consistent habits all the way through spring. The Leafs know what's expected, and they have enough depth to potentially go all the way. Falling short, again, would have to produce more significant alterations to the team than what it already has gone through over the past three months. Patience, it seems, always runs short in Toronto.\nX factor: William Nylander. Leafs' coach Sheldon Keefe is starting Nylander at center this season instead of on the wing, and that's enough to challenge any skater. However, this also happens to be a contract year for Nylander -- the status for which is already generating headlines of its own. The last time Nylander went up against the Leafs looking for a new deal, it led to a stalemate lasting well into the regular season. Is the uncertainty of what lies ahead for Nylander likely to weigh on him -- or the team -- as this season stretches on? And how will Nylander handle the added responsibilities, game after game, at the center spot? He has done it in short spurts before but never for a sustained period. There's a lot riding on Nylander to perform -- individually and for the entire team.\nFantasy outlook: Tyler Bertuzzi feels like a natural replacement for Michael Bunting on the top line and could be in for big fantasy boost with his new linemates.\nBold prediction: Toronto wins two playoff rounds.\nLast season: 47-21-14, 108 points. Lost in Western Conference finals.\nStanley Cup odds: +1500\nKey players added: F Matt Duchene, F Craig Smith, F Sam Steel\nKey players lost: F Max Domi, F Luke Glendening\nMost fascinating player: Miro Heiskanen. He consistently averages ice times that run longer than an episode of \"Abbott Elementary.\" He can take on the challenge of facing a top line while being at the controls of a penalty kill and a power-play unit. And now that he showed he can score more than 70 points in a season, Heiskanen has become too hard to ignore. Heiskanen's all-around performances were one of the reasons the Stars finished a point shy of being the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. It was also one of the reasons they were two wins away from the Stanley Cup Final and went from a wild-card entrant that was knocked out in the first round in 2021-22 to entering the 2023-24 season as a team in a championship window.\nBest case: Finding a way to build upon what they did last season by at least returning to the Western Conference finals. One of the questions facing the Stars prior to last season was whether they had enough offensive production. Under Peter DeBoer, the Stars had nine players who scored more than 10 goals and were sixth in goals scored. That production carried over into the postseason, which is how they were able to overpower the Wild in the first round, outlast the balanced Seattle Kraken in the second round and pose challenges to the team with the strongest depth in the NHL in the eventual Cup champion Golden Knights. Replicating the Stars success from last season would further legitimize that the Stars are in a championship window.\nWorst case: Losing Jake Oettinger to a long-term or season-ending injury. In the span of three seasons, Oettinger has gone from a promising prospect playing in a tandem to being one of the few goaltenders capable of starting more than 60 games at a time in which more NHL teams are using tandems. Oettinger started in 76% of the Stars' regular-season games while leading the league in starts, in addition to being in the top 10 in shots faced and saves. So what would happen in the event something prevented Oettinger from playing for an extended period? The Stars do have veteran Scott Wedgewood, who has 98 games of NHL experience. Beyond that? The two goalies the Stars have under contract throughout their system --- Matt Murray and Remi Poirier -- have a combined three games of NHL experience, with all of them belonging to Murray, who made his debut in 2022-23.\nX factor: It could depend upon the impact made by Thomas Harley and Nils Lundkvist. Part of the offseason discussion about the Stars has centered around their defense, which in itself is a bit of a complex issue. The Stars' defense was among the strongest units in both the regular season and playoffs in several 5-on-5 categories. What makes Harley and Lundkvist players to watch is that they could add more layers to the Stars' defensive dynamic. Harley averaged 0.47 points in the playoffs on a defensive unit that had most of its members average less than 0.31 points in the regular season. A lack of right-handed options is why Heiskanen was moved to the right. That, however, also presents Lundkvist with a chance to potentially challenge Jani Hakanpaa, who is also right-handed, for a top-four role.\nFantasy outlook: New to Dallas on a one-year deal, Matt Duchene is in position to kick his production back into gear after last season's humdrum campaign in Nashville. Not to the tune of 83 from 2021-22 but definitely more. Defenseman Miro Heiskanen is, far and away, the Stars' No. 1 fantasy option on the blue line.\nBold prediction: Jake Oettinger wins the Vezina Trophy.\nLast season: 42-32-8, 92 points. Lost in Stanley Cup Final.\nStanley Cup odds: +2000\nKey players added: D Oliver Ekman-Larsson, D Dmitry Kulikov, D Niko Mikkola, D Mike Reilly\nKey players lost: F Anthony Duclair, F Patric Hornqvist, D Radko Gudas, D Marc Staal, G Alex Lyon\nMost fascinating player: Sergei Bobrovsky. Which Bobrovsky will Florida get when the season opens? Will it be the Vezina Trophy-caliber goalie who carried the Panthers in net to an unexpected Stanley Cup Final appearance? Or will Bobrovsky struggle to show up like a $10 million-a-year player should and force Florida into either giving him time to recover or turning the No. 1 job over to someone else? Is there a long leash there from coach Paul Maurice given Bobrovsky's stunning postseason numbers (.915 SV%, 2.78 GAA)? It's been a wild ride for Bobrovsky with the Panthers so far, undulating between excellent and exasperating. We'll see what version of Bobrovsky will show up in 2023-24.\nBest case: Florida was the feel-good story of last season when it defied critics (and oddsmakers) to boldly go into the playoffs and all the way from there to a Cup Final. It would be easy to dismiss the Panthers' success as a one-off feat and assume they won't recreate it. That would be a mistake. If Bobrovsky can pick up where he left off, and if Matthew Tkachuk plays at the Hart Trophy-like level he did for much of the previous eight months and if the plethora of defensemen GM Bill Zito signed to sustain Florida's back end perform well while Aaron Ekblad and Brandon Montour recover from injury, then Florida would (and should) be considered a top contender in the Eastern Conference. The stars have aligned before above these Panthers; there's no reason it can't happen again.\nWorst case: There's a long list of things that will need to go right for Florida to touch the success it had last season. It's not clear how long the Panthers will be without Ekblad and Montour, leaving a gaping hole in the blue line that's even more pronounced now that Radko Gudas has moved on too. If Florida gets run aground defensively and is leaning too heavily on (A) Bobrovsky and (B) the ability to outscore its own issues every night, that doesn't project to end well. The worst case for Florida is it starts slow and falls too far out of postseason reach to make the type of Cinderella run that captivated us all in 2022-23. Going from three wins away from a championship to no playoff opportunity at all would be a tough pill to swallow.\nX factor: Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Someone has to step up for Florida on the back end. Could that be the veteran? This is a pivotal juncture for the 32-year-old player, who was bought out by Vancouver and now joins a young, hungry Panthers team that recently became familiar with winning. That alone should ignite Ekman-Larsson and help bring out his best game, something we haven't seen the most of since he was patrolling Arizona's blue line over five years ago. It's an opportunity to not only massively impact the Panthers' back end but also to show the rest of the league that, at least for the time being, Ekman-Larsson can still be an important player for his team.\nFantasy outlook: Injuries to Aaron Ekblad and Brandon Montour will keep the team's two best fantasy defenders on the sidelines until what sounds like November or December. It's a massive opportunity for Gustav Forsling.\nBold prediction: Patrick Kane signs with the Panthers.\nLast season: 47-22-13, 107 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1300\nKey players added: F Blake Wheeler, D Erik Gustafsson, G Jonathan Quick\nKey players lost: F Patrick Kane, F Vladimir Tarasenko, D Niko Mikkola\nMost fascinating player: Igor Shesterkin. Shesterkin is the Rangers' backbone. That's not to say New York isn't more than just goaltending; it is. But the team's success rides heavily on how well Shesterkin performs. There's nothing wrong with that; Shesterkin has the Vezina Trophy to prove how elite his skill set is. And yet, some have deemed his 2022-23 season a \"down\" one, even though Shesterkin collected a .916 SV% and 2.48 GAA. Shesterkin simply couldn't make up for all the Rangers' shortcomings -- but he will be looked at to do so this year anyway. New York is facing a certain amount of transition under new coach Peter Laviolette. Being able to rely on Shesterkin to give New York a chance every night he's in net -- and that'll be most of them -- is something they won't take for granted.\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBest case: New York thrives under Laviolette, and the fresh start provided after a couple of disappointing postseason runs. The Rangers revel in Shesterkin's excellent play but also get key contributions from their top six forwards -- led by Artemi Panarin and Mika Zibanejad -- and enjoy another Norris Trophy-type season from Adam Fox on the blue line. The Rangers' young stars -- including Kaapo Kakko -- pop off as significant point producers, and there's no obvious flaws to New York's new system. Not only does the team make the playoffs, but the Rangers find themselves back again in the mix to push beyond just a first-round showing.\nWorst case: The Rangers are counting on depth players like Blake Wheeler and Erik Gustafsson to come in and fill the gaps left behind by exiting skaters. When that doesn't happen, the Rangers' lack of contributors becomes an increasing problem. When Laviolette's tinkering proves unsuccessful, there are questions raised about whether New York was right to even move on from previous bench boss Gerard Gallant. Regardless of how good the Rangers' offensive core is, they can't make up for the team's defensive deficiencies, and New York flames out before the postseason begins.\nX factor: Attitude. Chris Kreider has talked about it. There's a certain chip on the Rangers' shoulder after the way their previous two seasons have gone, with one ending in the Eastern Conference finals and the other in a first-round exit versus New Jersey. Can't New York actually use that pain to its advantage now? It's one thing to talk about being frustrated; it's another to see the changes made in the wake of failure and not do something about it on the ice, where it actually counts. The Rangers have a chance to rally around their prior disappointment. Would that actually have an effect on their outcome this season? Stranger things have happened. But talk alone is cheap.\nFantasy outlook: The defense remains strong for fantasy, with Adam Fox challenging for best overall among defenders, Jacob Trouba remaining a source for counting stats and K'Andre Miller finding value.\nBold prediction: Kaapo Kakko takes flight and lives up to his draft pedigree.\nLast season: 65-12-5, 135 points. Lost in the first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +1800\nKey players added: F Milan Lucic, F James van Riemsdyk, D Kevin Shattenkirk\nKey players lost: F Patrice Bergeron, F Tyler Bertuzzi, F Nick Foligno, F Taylor Hall, F David Krejci, D Connor Clifton, D Dmitry Orlov\nMost fascinating player: Brad Marchand. The newly minted Bruins captain has been one of the team's most consistent contributors for over a decade, and now he's taking on a leadership mantle vacated by franchise legend Patrice Bergeron. Will that added responsibility alter how the feisty Marchand conducts himself on the ice? Or will it inspire even better play out of the 35-year-old, who impressively has maintained a near point-per-game output throughout his career to date?\nBest case: Boston endured a devastatingly poor finish in the playoffs last season that frankly overshadowed its wildly successful, historically dominant regular season. In a perfect world that disappointment fuels the Bruins' fire to not only be an Atlantic Division contender but pushes them through a long postseason run from there. That might not include the precursor of another Presidents' Trophy bid, especially given all the players Boston has lost since last season ended. It might actually be better for the Bruins to build their way up slowly, getting to construct a new identity under second-year coach Jim Montgomery and rallying around their impressive core helmed by Linus Ullmark, Charlie McAvoy, David Pastrnak, Marchand and more. There's a great deal of talent in the Bruins' ranks; best-case scenario is they make the most of it.\nWorst case: It's not easy replacing the number of key players Boston had to let walk out the door. GM Don Sweeney was hamstrung by a lack of cap space and that (partially) led to Orlov, Clifton, Hall and Bertuzzi exiting the organization. Bergeron and Krejci have retired. There are clear holes Boston must fill in the lineup, and the players Sweeney did add are all veterans in the later stages of their careers who can best be expected to contribute in depth roles. That might not be a recipe for success in the increasingly competitive Atlantic, where teams like Buffalo, Ottawa and Detroit will be right in the mix for a playoff spot when they weren't before. The Bruins could fall behind early in that race and never recover, finally fulfilling the yearly prophecy from outside voices that they are, in fact, no longer able to keep pace with the up-and-comers around them.\nX factor: Charlie McAvoy (and the Bruins' defense). It still feels like McAvoy doesn't earn enough attention for how good he is patrolling Boston's back end. This season will require the most out of all the Bruins' best players, but eyes will be on the likes of McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm (another under-the-radar defender) to help stabilize Boston early on when there could be some growing pains with the skaters being introduced up front. The Bruins lost some physicality with Clifton going to the Sabres, and the now-departed Orlov was a superb pickup for them at the trade deadline last spring. Now it's on Boston's incumbents to pick up the slack, helping the Bruins keep from (possibly) missing a beat.\nFantasy outlook: Replacing the total lost offensive talent of Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci won't be simple, as Charlie Coyle and James van Riemsdyk are next up for the scoring lines. Brad Marchand might not rebound from his 129th overall showing last season, but Charlie McAvoy might improve on his 92nd-place finish.\nBold prediction: Contrary to popular prediction, the Bruins make the playoffs.\nLast season: 46-30-6, 98 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +2200\nKey players added: F Luke Glendening, F Tyler Motte, F Conor Sheary\nKey players lost: F Corey Perry, F Alex Killorn, F Pat Maroon, F Ross Colton\nMost fascinating player: Victor Hedman. Tampa Bay is going to need everything out of Hedman now that Andrei Vasilevskiy is going to miss significant time with an injury. Hedman has been the Lightning's backbone on the blue line (and elsewhere) for essentially his entire career. But the pressure on Hedman to be Tampa Bay's top blueliner will only be amplified now with Vasilevskiy out. Hedman is 32. He's battled injuries, and the 24-plus minutes per game the veteran is averaging don't come without significant wear and tear on a nightly basis. Still, who can count out a talent like Hedman? The way he supports the Lightning at 5-on-5 and both special teams units is nothing short of impressive. What can he offer the Lightning now -- when they're a little more down and out?\nBest case: Tampa Bay set the bar high with two Stanley Cup wins and a Cup Final appearance since 2020. Given the loss of Vasilevskiy in net and the void left by Alex Killorn departing in free agency, the best case for Tampa would be seeing its depth start to shine long before the playoffs. Brandon Hagel and Tanner Jeannot explode in top-six or top-nine roles that take some pressure off the Lightning back end and allow the team time to establish a strong identity amid some changes (particularly up front). By the time Vasilevskiy is able to come back, the Lightning are still on the playoff bubble and ready to challenge for an Eastern Conference slot.\nWorst case: Tampa Bay can't overcome the early roadblocks in its way, and that ultimately decides where the Lightning end up -- outside the playoffs for the first time since Jon Cooper took over as the club's full-time head coach. Distractions abound with Vasilevskiy's injury and Steven Stamkos' contentious contract extension talks. And then there's the state of Tampa Bay's defense if Hedman can't be their usual workhorse. Will Mikhail Sergachev be able to fill in and carry a heavier load? Has Tampa Bay lost too many of its veteran voices in Killorn and Maroon especially that it can't fight through the inevitable rough patches ahead? This could be the year we see the Lightning window truly begin to close.\nX factor: Nikita Kucherov. Any success the Lightning have offensively is bound to be driven by Kucherov. He is still one of the league's most dynamic, dominant forwards (Kucherov just pocketed 113 points in 82 games last season) and can do a great deal to buoy any lagging confidence his team has in itself with some singularly stellar individual performances. It's rare that one player can genuinely be a difference-maker night after night, particularly when Atlantic rosters around the Lightning have been beefed up over the last few months, but Kucherov has the firepower to flip every switch on for Tampa Bay. They might need that more than ever this year.\nFantasy outlook: Mikhail Sergachev will be pushing Hedman for a larger share of the pie again, and he earned it last season, beating Hedman for overall value.\nBold prediction: The Lightning miss the playoffs.\nLast season: 47-25-10, 104 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +2000\nKey players added: F Pierre-Luc Dubois, D Vladislav Gavrikov, F Trevor Lewis, G David Rittich, G Cam Talbot\nKey players lost: D Sean Durzi, D Alexander Edler, F Alex Iafallo, G Joonas Korpisalo, F Rasmus Kupari, F Gabriel Vilardi\nMost fascinating player: Dubois. Another offseason. Another move by the Kings to signal that they are trying to win now. Kings GM Rob Blake was willing to part with quite a bit to trade for Dubois and then sign him to an eight-year contract worth $8.5 million annually. Getting Dubois accomplished a few items for the Kings. The first is that it places them in the discussion for one of the strongest center situations in the NHL in Phillip Danault, Anze Kopitar and Dubois anchoring their top three lines. Another element that comes with getting Dubois is that the Kings now have another top-six forward who they believe can help them now and in the future contend for what they feel has a chance to be a lengthy championship window.\nBest case: Slaying the dragon that is the first round. Practically every conversation around the Kings seeking to win a third Stanley Cup at some point comes back to the fact that getting beyond the first round has been an issue. Their two most recent postseason campaigns saw them get eliminated by the Oilers in the first round -- a place they have failed to escape since the 2013-14 season when they won their second Cup in three years. Advancing beyond the first round would not only see the Kings clear a near-decade long hurdle, but it would also see them gain a firmer grasp of a challenging Western Conference landscape.\nWorst case: It really would be losing in the first round for a third straight season. Part of it stems from the fact they have been aggressive over the last few seasons by going after players such as Viktor Arvidsson, Kevin Fiala, Vladislav Gavrikov, Danualt and Dubois. Another element is the fact that the Kings are about to face some considerable salary cap decisions when the next offseason arrives. Arvidsson along with all three goalies in Pheonix Copley, David Rittich and Cam Talbot are members of a five-player UFA class. Prospects such as Quinton Byfield, Blake Lizotte and Arthur Kaliyev are part of a five-player RFA class in need of new contracts for a team that CapFriendly projects will have $23.3 million in available cap space to address their roster needs.\nX factor: The dynamic with their goaltenders. Finding what they believed to be their strongest tandem became a season-long narrative for the Kings. They were hindered by a disconnect between a defensive structure that was top 10 in fewest shots allowed per 60, fewest scoring chances allowed per 60, fewest high-danger scoring chances per 60 and what proved to be porous goaltending. They used the deadline to address those concerns and were active again in the offseason by signing Rittich and Talbot. Having those two along with Copley gives three experienced options that only costs them $3.375 million in cap space for a team that's trying to find consistency in net.\nFantasy outlook: Those interested in a sleeper asset up front might give Quinton Byfield a long look. After two part-time seasons with the Kings, the 21-year-old is expected to kick it up a notch, enjoying a regular shot to compete within this club's impressive top six.\nBold prediction: Talbot proves to be the answer in goal.\nLast season: 46-25-11, 103 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +3500\nKey players added: F Patrick Maroon\nKey players lost: D Matt Dumba, D John Klingberg, F Gustav Nyquist, F Oskar Sundqvist, F Sam Steel\nMost fascinating player: Filip Gustavsson. Going from being the No. 3 goaltender in Ottawa to operating in tandem with a presumed future Hall of Fame inductee in Marc-Andre Fleury is the most succinct way to describe Gustavsson's arc. He would ultimately overtake Fleury, which was the case in the playoffs when he won twice in his five playoff appearances before the Wild were ultimately eliminated in the first round. Gustavsson then signed a three-year extension to give the Wild an option in net for the future with the 38-year-old Fleury in the final year of his deal while Jesper Wallstedt, their first-round pick from 2021, continues his development in the AHL.\nBest case: Reaching the playoffs for a fifth straight season would be a start. So would the idea of winning an opening-round series for the first time since the 2014-15 season. Getting beyond that familiar hurdle could be hypothetically accomplished if the Wild can find a way to create the offensive consistency that eluded them throughout the majority of last season. It was evident in that first-round series against the Stars that also saw the Wild finish the playoffs with the fewest shots per 60 and third-fewest goals per 60 in 5-on-5 play, according to Natural Stat Trick.\nWorst case: If they miss the playoffs or have a fifth straight first-round exit because of a lack of offense. One of the largest challenges the Wild faced in trying to address their offensive issues was a lack of cap space given the combined Zach Parise and Ryan Suter buyouts will cost them $14.7 million in 2023-24 and again in 2024-25. It's what further amplifies the need for the Wild to find even more production from a roster that went through more subtractions in the offseason than it did with Patrick Maroon being their lone addition.\nX factor: What sort of impact could Brock Faber and Marco Rossi have on a team in need of contributions from players on cheap deals? Faber provided insight into how he could help the Wild after he signed his ELC following the completion of the Golden Gophers' season that ended with a national title game defeat. He averaged 20 minutes in two regular-season games before logging more than 14 minutes in six playoff games. Rossi recorded one point -- an assist -- in 19 games with the Wild before going to the AHL where he scored 16 goals and averaged 0.96 points in 53 games. Given the offseason departures and the need to find contributors to fill those needs, it appears Faber and Rossi both have a chance to make a significant impact for the Wild.\nFantasy outlook: Young blueliner Calen Addison operates as an off-radar asset in fantasy competition that favors power-play points. The now 23-year-old led the Wild's blue line with 18 power-play points, and it wasn't even close, in just 62 games last year -- his first full NHL campaign.\nBold prediction: Bill Guerin becomes a sneaky seller.\nLast season: 40-31-11, 91 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +2500\nKey players added: F Noel Acciari, F Lars Eller, F Reilly Smith, D Ryan Graves, D Erik Karlsson\nKey players lost: F Jason Zucker, D Brian Dumoulin, D Jeff Petry, G Casey DeSmith\nMost fascinating player: Erik Karlsson. Is there any question who everyone will be watching when Pittsburgh takes the ice for opening night? Karlsson is in the middle of a career renaissance, and he's linking up with some of the NHL's most storied players of the past decade in Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang. What will Karlsson bring to the group? He's capable of taking on any role at 5-on-5 and on special teams, plus he's got the hunger to finally chase down an elusive Stanley Cup championship. Karlsson ended up in a place with recent playoff pedigree, but the Penguins need Karlsson to be on top of his game (again) to get there. Can he prove the 2023 Norris Trophy win was no fluke with another jaw-dropping season?\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nBest case: Pittsburgh is determined to avoid another embarrassing non-playoff finish and overcompensates entirely with a standout season from start to finish. Karlsson transitions without issue into a prominent role on the blue line, while Crosby and Malkin turn back the clock with vintage performances of their own. Tristan Jarry stands tall as the team's No. 1 netminder, and coach Mike Sullivan gets the most out of the Penguins' depth both up front and on the blue line. Pittsburgh works its way back to the postseason and goes on a surprisingly long run fueled by its veteran leaders.\nWorst case: Time catches up with everyone, and every team, eventually. That happens now to Pittsburgh. Instead of slowly sliding out of playoff contention, the Penguins are never even in the hunt as it's clear from the outset they can't keep up with the Eastern Conference's fast-paced risers. Jarry shows he can't carry the load in goal and frustration sets in for Crosby & Co. watching the team struggle its way through another season. GM Kyle Dubas starts exploring trade options early, and by mid-February is already offloading players in an effort to set Pittsburgh up for something better in the future.\nX factor: Tristan Jarry. Dubas took a chance on Jarry when he re-signed Pittsburgh's incumbent to a five-year, $26.8 million deal in July. It wasn't that Jarry was awful in 2022-23 (he produced a .909 SV% and 2.90 GAA) but it was his lack of timely saves and big performances at the right moments which drew criticism (not to mention he has been through spells of injury problems). To reward the 28-year-old with a lucrative, long-term deal adds plenty of pressure on Jarry going into a pivotal season for the Penguins. Will that ultimately affect his mindset? Or will Jarry thrive now that he knows the organization is behind him? It's a fine line to walk with goaltenders. Pittsburgh should find out quickly whether Dubas was right to bet on Jarry again.\nFantasy outlook: Jake Guentzel's injury to start the season opens a small window for Reilly Smith to gain some footing in the top six after coming over from the Golden Knights.\nBold prediction: Erik Karlsson plays a \"complete\" style.\nLast season: 46-28-8, 100 points. Lost in second round.\nStanley Cup odds: +4000\nKey players added: F Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, D Brian Dumoulin, F Kailer Yamamoto\nKey players lost: F Ryan Donato, F Joonas Donskoi, F Morgan Geekie, G Martin Jones, D Carson Soucy, F Daniel Sprong\nMost fascinating player: Philipp Grubauer. What allows Grubauer to be in this position is what he showed in the playoffs compared to the postseason. Since Grubauer signed that six-year contract worth $5.9 million in free agency, injuries and inconsistencies have led to him fielding a 3.01 GAA and a 0.892 save percentage. Yet what he accomplished in the playoffs beyond his 2.99 GAA and a .903 save percentage he posted is what creates intrigue. He was one of the main reasons why the Kraken upset the then-reigning Cup champion Avalanche in the first round and were a game away from the Western Conference final before losing to the Stars.\nBest case: Returning to at least the second round of the playoffs. Going from a lottery team in their first year of existence to a game away from the conference final the following season is proof that much can change in a year. Showing they are a consistent playoff team that can win at least one round appears to be the goal for the Kraken at a time in which the most recent Cup champions in the Avs and Golden Knights shows the path for a title -- as of this moment -- appears to be running through the Western Conference.\nWorst case: Any sort of regression. Wide-ranging as that might be, it's something to consider when it comes to what the Kraken could achieve in Year 3. What does Calder Trophy winner and NHL All-Star Game selection Matty Beniers do for a follow up act? How does Vince Dunn build upon a career year that saw him earn a long-term contract while further proving he could handle the demands of being a top-pairing defenseman? Does the scoring depth the Kraken used throughout the regular season and playoffs continue or will the production be harder to generate?\nX factor: How much of an impact can Chris Driedger have? Driedger missed the entire 2022-23 season recovering from a knee injury he sustained at the IIHF Men's World Championships in 2022. His injury led to the Kraken signing Martin Jones, who won a team-high 27 games before Grubauer was their full-time starter in the playoffs. Jones left in free agency, which means the Kraken will turn to either Driedger, who will start the season in the AHL, or Joey Daccord as the backup.\nFantasy outlook: Top center Matty Beniers appears on the upswing after bursting forth with 24 goals and 33 helpers in his rookie season. The reigning Calder winner projects to eclipse 65 points in his sophomore campaign.\nBold prediction: The Kraken take a step back, miss the playoffs.\nLast season: 42-33-7, 91 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +4000\nKey players added: D Connor Clifton, D Erik Johnson\nKey players lost: G Craig Anderson\nMost fascinating player: Rasmus Dahlin. Here's a 23-year-old defenseman entering a contract year after a breakout season where he tallied 73 points in 78 games and rightly earned Norris Trophy buzz throughout. Dahlin carries himself with veteran swagger and truly seems invested in sticking with the Sabres long-term because of their potential to finally turn the corner and become a perennial contender. Buffalo saw last season how, when its defensive details faltered, so did its success in the win column. Dahlin seems poised to fix that this year, and elevate not only the Sabres' back end but his own stock as a Norris contender again. Is that too much pressure for someone Dahlin's age (and with the added expectations of negotiating a new deal)? Time will tell.\nBest case: Buffalo makes the playoffs. That's it. There is nothing (on paper) holding the Sabres back from ending the 12-year postseason drought looming over their organization like an unmovable black cloud. Buffalo has the young talents (see: Dahlin, Tage Thompson, Dylan Cozens, Mattias Samuelsson, etc) and veteran presences (i.e. Kyle Okposo, Jeff Skinner, and Alex Tuch) to produce a complementary mix up front and on the blue line. There's significant buy-in from Buffalo's players to the identity and culture they've been cultivating under GM Kevyn Adams and head coach Don Granato. This is when the Sabres have to make good on their potential and show why a slow-and-steady rebuild was the correct path to their eventual sustained success.\nWorst case: The Sabres fall short, again. Their playoff dry spell hits 13 seasons and it shakes the core foundation of what the franchise thought it was creating through the last several years of patience with its process. While players have outwardly stated they're ready to take on those additional expectations (both internal and external), it's easier said than done -- particularly when a club runs up against inevitable tough stretches and injury issues. If Buffalo can't weather the storms better than it has in the past -- think of how that stretch of winning one game out of nine in March derailed its postseason hopes last year -- then the Sabres find themselves sitting in disappointment once more as the clock keeps running on their time to step up and make some noise.\nX factor: Goaltending. The Sabres are counting on youngsters like Devon Levi (age: 21) and Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen (24) to take the reigns from previous incumbents like Anderson (who had a late-career surge in Buffalo over the last couple years). Granato has said he wouldn't bet against Levi being able to take over the Sabres' starting job and Levi did produce a .905 SV% and 2.94 GAA in seven NHL appearances during the 2022-23 season. But will Levi and Luukkonen combine to be a strong enough tandem to carry Buffalo where it wants to go? Or will netminding ultimately doom the Sabres to a lesser outcome in the standings than they're aiming towards? For a team desperately trying to get its foot in the door, the margin for error at any position is slim.\nFantasy outlook: By not going another route in the offseason, the Sabres have indicated a willingness to let Levi take the ball and run with it as the starter. Given the talent up front, there's a ton of potential value packed in Levi as a fantasy pick.\nBold prediction: The internet discovers JJ Peterka.\nLast season: 42-31-9, 93 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +5000\nKey players added: None\nKey players lost: F Josh Bailey\nMost fascinating player: Mathew Barzal. What can we make of Barzal's contributions up until now for the Islanders? He's consistently producing more assists than goals and averages a decent point total year over year, but where is Barzal's impact truly felt? Is he the game-changing forward stats (on their face) might suggest? And if so, why haven't the Islanders had more success since he's been in the fold? There's no question Barzal is a top-end puck mover, but is he driving play enough? Is there more to be expected from him? There's intrigue around him going into this year given how little GM Lou Lamoriello did to upgrade the Islanders beyond re-signing some of their own players. If Barzal could have a breakout season of sorts where he's scoring timely goals and being a greater playmaker? That's big.\nBest case: The Islanders' commitment to their own pays off. Ilya Sorokin -- fresh from signing an eight-year extension -- puts on a Vezina Trophy-worthy show to guide New York into the postseason, where they battle through a couple rounds. Bo Horvat showcases more than just a flash or two of his best self and drives the Islanders' offense in the way his capabilities have proven, in the past, that he can. The Islanders see sustained growth from some of their young studs -- including Oliver Wahlstrom and Noah Dobson -- and the momentum gives the organization hope for a bright future beyond just this coming season.\nWorst case: New York's season is as stagnant as its offseason signings. The team sputters immediately and even Sorokin's brilliance can't make up for a lack of offense and general star power at either end of the ice. Horvat wilts under the pressure to step up and Barzal doesn't evolve enough to help the team change course. Coach Lane Lambert loses the room, and New York falls into the mushy middle where it remains until the regular season ends -- without a postseason bid.\nX factor: Special teams. New York iced the third-worst power play in the NHL last season, lowest by far of any team that went to the playoffs. Even Dobson has admitted the Islanders \"lost their confidence\" there as things continued to spiral out of control (losing Barzal to injury certainly didn't boost New York's prospects there, either). It's hard to keep pace with the league's best teams when you can't put pucks in with the man advantage. The Islanders must see improvements there in order to be a competitive team -- not just in the regular season but if the playoffs are in their future, as well. The Islanders can't be in their own heads again and let power play chances be a hindrance instead of a help.\nFantasy outlook: A healthy Barzal hasn't had a heck of a lot of time to gel with Horvat, so the hope is that the latter can prop up Barzal's stagnated value in recent seasons. If they stick together, there will be a golden opportunity on the other wing for someone -- and Wahlstrom has the inside track.\nBold prediction: Barzal grows his hair back.\nLast season: 38-27-17, 93 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +3500\nKey players added: F Yegor Sharangovich\nKey players lost: F Trevor Lewis, F Milan Lucic, D Michael Stone, F Tyler Toffoli\nMost fascinating player: Elias Lindholm. Does he stay? Does he go? What does a future with him in Calgary look like? What does a future without him in Calgary look like? Lindholm, who is part of an eight-player UFA class, is expected to give the Flames a decision regarding his future at some point. Should he opt to stay, the Flames would be retaining one of their most important forwards considering Lindholm was second on the team in points and can log significant ice time on both special teams units. Yet if he chooses to depart, it would leave the Flames once again searching for a way to fill the void left by another key member of their lineup.\nBest case: Getting into the playoffs and winning a first-round series allows those players who are still undecided about staying the green light to continue with the Flames. Part of what makes the Flames' current situation so cumbersome is that for the players who could be elsewhere, they have the same amount of players who are under contract for at least two more seasons which represents a long-term plan. It's possible that a strong regular season coupled with a postseason run could serve as a potential retainment tool as the Flames look to create even more roster continuity.\nWorst case: Missing the playoffs while failing to capitalize on the opportunity to trade any one of those pending UFAs for draft capital could be the answer. Even for all the challenges they faced last season, the Flames were still two points away from being in the final wild-card spot and qualifying for the playoffs for a consecutive season. Couple that with the fact they have a few decisions to make regarding a number of their UFAs and it reinforces how the 2023-24 season has a chance to be a pivotal one for the Flames' current and future plans.\nX factor: Was last April a stepping stone for Jacob Markstrom? Finding consistency proved to be a season-long issue for Markstrom, who finished with a 2.92 goals-against average and a .892 save percentage. Those were the lowest marks he's recorded since establishing himself as a full-time goalie in the 2015-16 season. Something that could create optimism regarding what he could achieve in 2023-24 is how he performed in April. Despite going 1-1-2, Markstrom had a 2.47 GAA and a .915 save percentage in five appearances. Even though it was not the largest sample size, it was still the highest save percentage and second-highest GAA that Markstrom recorded in any month.\nFantasy outlook: Get ready for Jonathan Huberdeau to rebound after hemorrhaging 70 points from the previous season in Florida. No, he won't collect 115 again, but 75-80 feels well within reach, skating on a line with top center Lindholm.\nBold prediction: Andrew Mangiapane has a monster rebound year.\nLast season: 39-35-8, 86 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +5000\nKey players added: F Vladimir Tarasenko, G Joonas Korpisalo\nKey players lost: F Alex DeBrincat, G Cam Talbot\nMost fascinating player: Korpisalo. Ottawa has been waiting on a No. 1 stud to take over the net. GM Pierre Dorion tried to fill in that gap with Cam Talbot and the veteran failed to deliver. Now he's got Korpisalo stepping into his first true starting job. Will he be the savior these Senators have been longing for, one of the missing pieces in Ottawa's long journey back to being a playoff-caliber team? Korpisalo was primarily a backup in Columbus and through his brief stint with the Kings post-trade deadline last spring. Yet his numbers (.904 SV%, 3.01 GAA) are relatively strong. Can Korpisalo -- in tandem with Anton Forsberg -- elevate Ottawa in an area they've been perennially struggling with? That could be a difference-maker in their outcomes this season.\nBest case: Ottawa makes the playoffs. It's been a long time coming. There's been enough talk about how the Senators structured their rebuild, how they drafted and developed talent (starting with Tim Stutzle, Brady Tkachuk and Thomas Chabot, among others), how they've been patient in attacking roster construction. All of the things. It's about time Ottawa saw the fruits of its labors. A healthy Josh Norris -- who missed almost all of last season with injury -- and Artem Zub will have a major impact on Ottawa upfront and across the blue line. Dorion went about addressing the Senators' goaltending in the offseason and with the team's sale done and approved, there are no distractions. This is Ottawa's moment.\nWorst case: Well, Ottawa doesn't make the playoffs. Whether due to injuries stacking up (again), or just an inability to build chemistry and reach its potential. Doesn't matter why, really. If the Senators aren't at least in the postseason race to the end then it will be hard for Dorion to not just keep his own job, but stick behind coach DJ Smith another season on top of it. The Senators and their fans have been waiting a long time to reach this sort of pinnacle. Letting another season go by without anything to show for it by way of a postseason bid would simply not be good enough for anyone inside or outside the organization.\nX factor: Jakob Chychrun. When the long-time Arizona defender finally moved on elsewhere it was to an Ottawa team that fully embraced having a blueliner of his ability on their side. The Senators just want to see Chychrun at his best -- and they're still waiting. After being traded to Canada's capital city, Chychrun played in just 12 games before missing the rest of the year with an injury. The five points he produced in that span was significantly less than the sort of impact Ottawa is rightly expecting from him. The Senators can't be the contenders they want -- and need -- to be without Chychrun playing like he's capable of (see: 41 points in 56 games in 2020-21). Will he get back there? That's the question.\nFantasy outlook: The defense is deep, with Chabot still likely at the top of the pyramid, but ebbs and flows where Chychrun and Jake Sanderson take turns as No. 1 are likely.\nBold prediction: The Senators make the playoffs.\nLast season: 46-33-3, 95 points. Lost in first round.\nStanley Cup odds: +5000\nKey players added: G Laurent Brossoit, F Alex Iafallo, F Rasmus Kupari, F Gabriel Vilardi\nKey players lost: F Pierre-Luc Dubois, G David Rittich, F Blake Wheeler\nMost fascinating player: Connor Hellebuyck. He's a perennial Vezina Trophy candidate who's become the sort of nightly fixture that can be trusted to start more than 60 games a season. His performances can oftentimes be the difference between reaching the playoffs or missing out on them entirely. What Hellebuyck has accomplished has made him one of, if not the, most crucial player the Jets have in their annual bid to reach the postseason. And similar to a number of his teammates, Hellebuyck is in the final year of his contract.\nBest case: In terms of the regular season? Getting to the playoffs and advancing beyond the first round for the first time since the 2020-21 season would be one answer. In terms of their roster? That onto itself is a more complex discussion. Trading Pierre-Luc Dubois while placing former captain Blake Wheeler on waivers were the first major changes for a roster that could be significantly altered over the coming months. Assessing what happens next when it comes to the six players in the last years of their contract is a dilemma that is seeking a resolution.\nWorst case: In terms of the regular season? Missing the playoffs or reaching the playoffs only to be eliminated in the first round is also an answer. As for their roster? It's plausible the answer could hinge upon what happens with their six-player pending UFA class. Brenden Dillon, Nino Niederreiter, Mark Scheifele and Hellebuyck are part of that group entering the final years of their contracts for a team that has decisions to make. Receiving the sort of return that can either help them now which was the case in the Dubois trade or aid them later would plausibly soften the blow of the Jets losing those players. Watching them leave without receiving anything in return beyond freeing up cap space, however, could prove problematic given the Jets only have 20 out of a possible 21 draft picks over the next three cycles.\nX factor: A healthy Cole Perfetti would hypothetically give the Jets another option now that they are trying to recoup the production they lost by moving on from Dubois and Wheeler. Ever since they drafted Perfetti in the first round in 2020, the Jets haven't been able to receive the firmest grasp when it comes to what Perfetti can provide. Injuries limited him to seven points in 18 games during the 2021-22 season while the 2022-23 saw him score eight goals and have 30 points in 51 games before he was moved to injured reserve in February.\nFantasy outlook: With Pierre-Luc Dubois and Blake Wheeler sent packing, youngsters Perfetti and Gabriel Vilardi have ripe opportunities to carve out permanent roles within the Jets' top six. As second-line center in the case of Perfetti, and somewhere on the wing for Vilardi.\nBold prediction: Hellebuyck re-signs in Winnipeg.\nLast season: 35-37-10, 80 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Alex DeBrincat, F J.T. Compher, F Klim Kostin, F Daniel Sprong, D Shayne Gostisbehere, D Jeff Petry, G James Reimer\nKey players lost: F Dominik Kubalik, F Filip Zadina, G Alex Nedeljkovic\nMost fascinating player: DeBrincat. How do you not wonder about what DeBrincat will do for Detroit's offense? The Red Wings haven't produced a 40-goal scorer since Marian Hossa hit the mark in 2008-09. That was in Detroit's heyday of 25 consecutive playoff appearances. Can DeBrincat help ignite the Red Wings' up front and recapture some of that former glory? It was just two years ago in Chicago that the 24-year-old winger topped out at 41 goals, and he'll be surrounded by greater talents even in Detroit than he had with Blackhawks (no disrespect to Patrick Kane, of course). DeBrincat wanted a fresh start after his lone season in Ottawa last year, and going home to the Detroit area seems like a perfect match between player and team.\nBest case: Detroit's been biding its time getting back into contender mode. GM Steve Yzerman looks to have his proverbial ducks in a row now for the Red Wings to be back in that space. Yzerman's club hasn't reached playoffs since 2016 and the aggressive nature of Detroit's last two offseasons -- adding top-tier young skaters like DeBrincat, rising studs like Ville Husso and veteran voices with David Perron -- has all pointed them in a strong direction. Best case scenario now is that it includes a postseason berth. Patience is a virtue, but it's also got to yield results, too. The Red Wings haven't shied away from recognizing their flaws and addressing them, like swapping out Nedeljkovic for a seasoned veteran in Reimer to play behind Husso. Detroit looks ready to announce itself onto the postseason stage again.\nWorst case: Yzerman wasn't making moves to improve Detroit at the trade deadline last spring. He -- and the team -- knew they wouldn't get over the hump and be a playoff club by April. History repeating itself for an eighth straight year in 2023-24 could spell a disaster of sorts. Detroit can't have lesser expectations than playoffs given how stacked its roster is at nearly every position compared to where it's been in years past. Even if injuries pile up there's ample depth in the Red Wings' ranks, too, which should keep them from stumbling too hard. Detroit failing to reach its own potential in the coming season could leave ownership no choice but to make changes internally, something that might lead to unnecessary (not to mention destabilizing) turmoil for the team.\nX factor: Derek Lalonde. Yzerman inserted the former Tampa Bay Lightning assistant into Detroit's head-coaching job ahead of last season, and that was a clear learning experience for Lalonde. How can he be better now behind the bench and help these Red Wings rise? Detroit's special teams improved slightly last season over the previous campaign, and there were improvements made on the defensive side as well. But for Detroit to overtake some of the other Eastern Conference power players and work its way into the playoff picture, its coach has to be pushing the right buttons. Can Lalonde maximize the Red Wings roster and get the most out of their top talents in particular?\nFantasy outlook: With an upgraded defense, Husso is a candidate to rebound from a disappointing debut after the Red Wings invested in him last offseason.\nBold prediction: Lucas Raymond has his breakout.\nLast season: 42-32-8, 92 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Gustav Nyquist, F Ryan O'Reilly, D Luke Schenn\nKey players lost: F Matt Duchene, F Ryan Johansen\nMost fascinating player: O'Reilly. Never mind the fact he's considered to be one of the game's premier two-way centers. The case can be made that O'Reilly and his decision to sign a four-year contract with the Predators represents something. Exactly what it represents is the mystery and that's the point. Back in March, the Predators used the trade deadline to hit a reset button of sorts which allowed David Poile to set the stage for his heir, Barry Trotz, to take over as the club's GM. Trotz kept it going by trading Johansen and placing Matt Duchene on waivers. Only to then place the Preds in a position to have one of the more surprising hauls by signing three veterans led by O'Reilly which has led to questions about if the Preds could plausibly be in contention for the playoffs after last's absence snapped an eight-year postseason streak.\nBest case: New Predators coach Andrew Brunette's prolific philosophies provide the roster with the sort of goals that eluded them last season. And if that happens? It's possible that Brunette's tactics could lead to the Predators returning to the postseason. Even with the trades they made at the deadline plus Johansen being out since February, the Predators still finished three points shy of the final wild-card spot. Brunette's time as the interim coach of the Panthers, along with his lone year as a Devils assistant, saw both teams finish among the top 10 in the league in a number of offensive categories. Getting those sorts of results for a team that missed the playoffs by three points while having a minus-9 goal differential could prove crucial in Brunette's first year behind the bench.\nWorst case: Does one really exist? Let's say the Predators miss the playoffs. It's a consecutive campaign without the postseason for a team that was already considered by some to be a bit of a guessing game when it came to the playoffs. If that happens, then, the Predators can continue to stockpile more draft capital and/or prospects considering they have nine pending UFAs led by Tyson Barrie who could be moved at or ahead of the trade deadline. So what happens if they do make the playoffs? Then the question becomes: Can the Preds make it out of the first round for the first time since the 2017-18 season?\nX factor: How much support will Juuse Saros receive this season? No goaltender played more games, logged more minutes, faced more shots and made more saves than Saros during the 2022-23 season. What he's accomplished since taking over as the team's full-time starter is give the Predators a goaltender who is capable of starting more than 60 times in a season at a time in which more teams are shifting to tandems. Providing Saros with more support either in the form of facing fewer shots or scoring more goals could lessen the burden carried by one of the NHL's premier goaltenders.\nFantasy outlook: Second-line winger Tommy Novak is looking to replicate, if not better, last season's unanticipated haul of 43 points in 51 games. There's no reason to believe Novak can't again flirt with a similar pace, but this time through a full run in the NHL.\nBold prediction: The Predators make the playoffs.\nLast season: 35-37-10, 80 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Max Pacioretty, D Joel Edmundson\nKey players lost: F Conor Sheary\nMost fascinating player: Alex Ovechkin. Who isn't enthralled by Ovechkin and his continued milestone chase? How often is there a player in the league within legitimate striking distance of setting new benchmarks and re-writing history books on a nightly basis? It's impossible not to get caught up in that, whether you're rooting for Ovechkin to usurp Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's top all-time goal scorer or not. Washington didn't have much else to be optimistic about last year beyond Ovechkin pumping in goals to get him closer to Gretzky's mark. There's little doubt Ovechkin's continued prowess will draw everyone in again, regardless of how the Capitals are doing around him.\nBest case: Washington GM Brian MacLellan made the right call trading players away at the deadline last season and letting the Capitals slide out of the playoff field. The changes made since then all combine now to boost Washington back into contending status. First-year head coach Spencer Carbery hits the ground running with a strong first month of the season to set Washington up well. Nicklas Backstrom, John Carlson and Tom Wilson -- who all missed significant time with injuries last season -- are stronger than ever and remain healthy for a full 82-game season. Pacioretty is back on the ice too and supports the Capitals' offense enough to see them back into the postseason. And of course, Ovechkin gets closer to his next milestone.\nWorst case: Washington gets off the ground but never takes flight. Its top talents have lost a step against the league's tougher competition, and Carbery can't find the right combinations up front to steer Washington out of its skid. Evgeny Kuznetsov remains disgruntled with his place in the organization and that seeps into his diminished play on the ice. The Capitals can't gain any momentum and it's obvious they're done before their calendar flips to 2024.\nX factor: It's all about the veterans -- namely Backstrom, T.J. Oshie and Kuznetsov. What more do they have to give the Capitals now? Backstrom has put his body through a recent hip resurfacing. Oshie missed the end of last season with injury and underwent a double ablation surgery in the offseason. And Kuznetsov admitted to a lingering back issue that hindered him most of last season. Plus, there's Pacioretty's condition coming off two torn Achilles. If those types of problems crop up again, how will the Capitals cope? Is there enough depth to patch the holes? Washington is in a precarious position as it is with the number of 30-somethings it leans on every night. Last season showed how fast the wheels fall off without some of those key players. Is Washington doomed to face a similar fate this season?\nFantasy outlook: If things go well, Darcy Kuemper would be a fantasy boon, but his fortune will ride with the overall fortunes of his teammates.\nBold prediction: Ovechkin will score his 850th career goal Jan. 18, 2024.\nLast season: 38-37-7, 83 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Teddy Blueger, D Ian Cole, D Carson Soucy, F Pius Suter\nKey players lost: G Collin Delia, D Oliver Ekman-Larsson\nMost fascinating player: Filip Hronek. There's no shortage of candidates, yet what might give Hronek the edge is all the moving pieces involved with his situation. It starts with the fact that the Canucks parted with two picks -- namely the first-rounder they received in the Bo Horvat trade to get Hronek. Then there's the fact he sustained a season-ending shoulder injury that limited his time with the Canucks to four games. Finally, a healthy Hronek proved to be the first move in the Canucks' attempt to revamp their defense beyond Quinn Hughes. Since getting Hronek in a trade, the Canucks used the offseason to sign Cole and Soucy with the aim those collective arrives can help a defensive unit that fielded the NHL's worst penalty kill with a 71.6% success rate in addition to being seventh in goals allowed per 60 in 5-on-5 play.\nBest case: Any of the progress Rick Tocchet made can manifest itself over an entire season that could see them in the wild-card hunt. It starts with the notion the Canucks won 20 of their 36 games with Tocchet on the bench. That was the 12th most victories in the NHL during that time. Even though the Canucks are still in cap limbo, they addressed their needs by getting a pair of two-way forwards such as Blueger and Suter in addition to defensemen such as Cole and Soucy. If the Canucks can harness what they did under Tocchet, show signs of defensive improvement all while remaining above league average in goals scored? It's possible they could be among the teams pushing for a playoff spot.\nWorst case: None of the progress Tocchet made manifests itself over an entire season which would bring the franchise back to where they were when they fired Bruce Boudreau and hired Tocchet in the first place. Last offseason, there was the expectation that the Canucks could be among the teams to challenge for a playoff spot only to end up closer to a lottery spot rather than one in the postseason. It leaves the Canucks hypothetically facing two realities: One in which they find a way to extend what they did in the late part of last season into something that comes with long-term results. Or? The second is they're forced to once again search for the answer to the question of what will it take for them to find the success that has eluded them?\nX factor: What about the Canucks' goaltending? Last season, they used four goaltenders to get through a season that saw three of them play in more than 20 games. Of the three who had more than 20 games, none of them finished with a GAA below 3.00 with Thatcher Demko being the only one with a save percentage of more than .900 with a .901 mark. Demko and Spencer Martin are back with the notion that any improvements they show could play a major role in the Canucks trying to overcome the defensive challenges that plagued them throughout all of last season.\nFantasy outlook: Now healthy, Demko will have an easier time of it with new defenders Cole and Soucy aboard. The Canucks were significantly better defensively once Tocchet took over midseason. Poised to earn around 60 starts, Demko presents as a top-15 fantasy goalie once more.\nBold prediction: The Elias Pettersson contract speculation will loom over everything.\nLast season: 25-48-9, 59 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +15000\nKey players added: D Damon Severson, D Ivan Provorov\nKey players lost: None\nMost fascinating player: Adam Fantilli. Columbus needs a feel-good story to rally around. Fantilli could be it. The Blue Jackets' third overall pick is an exciting center prospect who should get a chance to showcase his talent early and often for the Blue Jackets. He's already shown some of that in the preseason, scoring his first goal in a Columbus uniform and appearing focused on transitioning seamlessly to the regular season. What happens for Fantilli when he gets there? How will he mesh into an offense that already includes the likes of Johnny Gaudreau and Patrik Laine, two players eager to see Columbus out of what was a dark, dismal, disappointing 2022-23? Inside and outside the organization there are undoubtedly high hopes for how Fantilli can put Columbus back on track.\nBest case: The Blue Jackets don't spiral out of the playoff conversation immediately (as they did a year ago) and instead find some consistent success out of the gate. With the Mike Babcock distraction dealt with already and new coach Pascal Vincent settled in, Columbus finds a rhythm from its forward group on down. The new additions of Severson and Provorov to the blue line -- plus the return of a healthy Zach Werenski -- turn Columbus' defense into a bona fide beast. After losing too much of last season to injury, a healthy Laine re-takes his mantle as a dominant scoring threat, Gaudreau emerges as a genuine superstar, Werenski plays a full 82-game slate anchoring the club's blue line and Elvis Merzlikins puts his best foot forward in the No. 1 netminder role. That combines to keep Columbus in the playoff hunt through April.\nWorst case: There's another wasted season ahead for Columbus. Despite Babcock departing in September, the fallout from the internal scandal doesn't dissipate as quickly and remains a distraction leading into the season. The Blue Jackets struggle to find their gait and injuries to key players pop up too often again. Fantilli can't find his footing against NHL competition, and that drags the Blue Jackets down physically and emotionally. Gaudreau can't find his best game, and Merzlikins has no help in front of him to keep pucks out of the net. The futility of watching another bad year play out leads GM Jarmo Kekalainen to make drastic changes across the board.\nX factor: Vincent. There's no way around it -- Vincent wasn't put in the best position to succeed. Stepping in when Babcock was being forced out is a tough spot to start from in your first NHL head coaching job, no matter how comfortable he might have already been within the Blue Jackets' organization. Beyond just that drama, Vincent has plenty on his shoulder all of a sudden trying to bring Columbus back from the proverbial brink. The organization can't keep wasting time and burning years off key contracts to top players. How well will Vincent tackle the challenge in front of him? The Blue Jackets' prospects this season might hang in the balance.\nFantasy outlook: The Blue Jackets massively upgraded their blue line this offseason, by virtue of Werenski returning to health in conjunction with trades for Severson and Provorov.\nBold prediction: Kekalainen is fired before next offseason.\nLast season: 37-38-7, 81 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +7500\nKey players added: F Kevin Hayes\nKey players lost: F Josh Leivo, F Tyler Pitlick\nMost fascinating player: Hayes. What once began as a megadeal ultimately led to the Blues getting their much-coveted top-six center for a 2024 sixth-round pick while the Flyers also retained 50 percent of his salary. Part of what makes Hayes' arrival alluring is the fact he offers the Blues a venerable anchor down the middle with six 40-point seasons who also logged the third-most defensive zone starts by a Flyers forward last season. Having someone who can contribute on both ends could potentially play a role in the Blues reversing course on a 38-goal differential from last season that further amplified their struggles.\nBest case: Everything implemented by first-year Blues assistant Mike Weber allows the team to find the defensive cohesion that eluded them last season. Weber, who spent last season with the Rochester Americans in the AHL, was brought in to help organize a defensive structure that made the Blues one of the most porous teams in the league. Finding a solution for those issues could aid in providing more comfort for Jordan Binnington and promising rookie Joel Hofer, who only has eight games of NHL experience having spent the majority of the last two seasons in the AHL.\nWorst case: An inability to find some sort of defensive consistency. In most cases, a team with deficiencies in certain areas can use the offseason to retool those areas by potentially changing their personnel. Unless it's the Blues -- whose plans were rather complex and limited by the fact they have four defensemen who each have three more years left on their contracts -- earn more than $4 million annually with the additional caveat all of them have no-trade clauses. It's another reason why moves such as trading for Hayes, promoting Hofer and hiring Weber have a chance to play a vital role.\nX factor: It really is whatever Weber can do to turnaround the Blues' defensive issues. Focusing this much on an assistant coach can be considered a bit much. What justifies the discussion about Weber is the fact the Blues were in the bottom 10 in shots allowed per 60, goals allowed per 60, scoring chances allowed per 60 and high-danger chances per 60. Having that context along with the contract dynamics is what makes Weber and whatever he can accomplish with the Blues this season paramount to any progress they seek in 2023-24.\nFantasy outlook: While defender Torey Krug has the higher fantasy ceiling, it's worth noting Justin Faulk is coming off the most productive -- to the tune of 50 points -- season of his NHL career. Faulk also doesn't shy away from shooting on net and blocking opposing shots.\nBold prediction: Jordan Binnington gets his first fighting major.\nLast season: 28-40-14, 70 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +15000\nKey players added: F Nick Bjugstad, F Logan Cooley, D Travis Dermott, D Matt Dumba, D Sean Durzi, F Alexander Kerfoot, F Jason Zucker\nKey players lost: D Connor Mackey\nMost fascinating player: Cooley. An already noticeable offseason received even more attention when the Coyotes announced they signed Cooley to an entry-level contract. Cooley, who was the No. 3 pick from the 2022 NHL draft, announced in May that he would return to the University of Minnesota for his sophomore season only to then sign his ELC in late July. What made Cooley a lottery pick was the fact he's been projected as a two-way, top-six center. The 19-year-old used what ultimately became his only season at Minnesota to show what made him so promising by finishing his freshman year with 22 goals and 60 points in 39 games to help the Golden Gophers to a national title overtime defeat. And while the United States finished third at the U-20 World Junior Championships, Cooley excelled with seven goals and 14 points in seven games.\nBest case: Reaching the 30-win mark and/or the 80-point plateau could be used as something of a benchmark to evaluate the Coyotes' rebuild. The Coyotes haven't won more than 30 games since the 2019-20 season with their most recent 80-point campaign coming during the 2018-19 season. Keep in mind, the Coyotes went from a pair of consecutive seasons that saw them finish with less than 60 points to finishing with 70 points in 2022-23. A considerable amount of that progress was guided by members of their young core such as Barrett Hayton, Clayton Keller, Matias Maccelli, J.J. Moser and Nick Schmaltz. It's a group that has now added veterans such as Dumba, Kerfoot and Zucker in addition to an offseason trade that saw them add Durzi to further strengthen their roster.\nWorst case: Not living up to any of the intrigue they've created over the offseason. As it stands, the Coyotes are still in that space in which they finished 25 points out of a playoff spot while still being 12 points above the fewest points in the league. Yet they still reinforced their top-nine forward corps and top-four defensive options. Even if the Coyotes are nowhere near a playoff spot, they can still help themselves ahead of the trade deadline considering Dumba and Zucker are part of a six-player pending UFA class who could see some if its members get moved for draft capital.\nX factor: Winning on the road. Compare the Coyotes' home record to the rest of the NHL. They nearly won the same amount of home games as Stanley Cup contenders such as the Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers. Playing on the road, however, presented quite a few challenges as the Coyotes finished with a league-low seven victories. Part of what made their offseason haul considerably enterprising was the potential effect those new players could have. One way to measure that impact is if they can aid the Coyotes' young core in winning more games away from Mullett Arena.\nFantasy outlook: Keller is due to score a bunch again after erupting for 86 points in his sixth season. Los Angeles export Durzi is the most intriguing blue-line fantasy pick, as a threat to boot either Juuso Valimaki or Moser from the power play, while regularly contributing in other fantasy-relevant facets.\nBold prediction: André Tourigny gets a Jack Adams nomination.\nLast season: 31-45-6, 68 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: F Alex Newhook\nKey players lost: D Joel Edmundson\nMost fascinating player: Juraj Slafkovsky. Montreal shocked (or at the very least surprised) more than a few pundits when selecting Slafkovsky No. 1 overall in the 2022 NHL entry draft. Expectations were naturally high for Slafkovsky entering his rookie season, but the freshman produced a lackluster 10 points in his first 39 games. Slafkovsky's year ended there due to injury and now all eyes will be on how the sophomore bounces back. The Canadiens took a risk using their top pick on Slafkovsky, and granted he is only 19 with plenty of runway left to prove himself on. Will that begin to happen immediately when the new season starts? Or is Montreal going to be waiting even longer to see the best in Slafkovsky's game?\nBest case: The Canadiens need another strong season of growth for their youngest players. And that goes beyond just seeing Nick Suzuki, Cole Caufield, Slafkovsky and others have great statistical showings on the ice. Best case, Montreal's 2023-24 campaign also includes some sustained stretches of winning that allows its young core to truly taste what it means to be in the hunt for something -- to be chasing a significant outcome. Maybe that's just a few weeks of being on the playoff periphery and getting a feel for what that means. Maybe it's seeing consistency from their top-six and watching chemistry develop. Montreal just wants the needle to keep moving in a position direction.\nWorst case: Montreal's had its problems with injuries (Caufield, for instance, was out from January on last year following shoulder surgery). The Canadiens are tied to their young talents and when they go down, so do Montreal's chances of taking those necessary steps forward that will dictate the franchise's future. Beyond just good health, the Canadiens require more out of skaters like Kirby Dach (38 points in 58 games last season) and have to avoid letting guys like Suzuki fall into stagnant roles. Montreal can't let its foot off the gas now or be derailed by the things they can control -- like continuously putting players in the best position to succeed.\nX factor: Defense. Montreal was poor at defending off the rush last season. Too many pucks were going in the net and deflating the Canadiens prospects night after night. The Canadiens have to get more buy-in on the defensive side from their forward group, starting with top-six skaters like Josh Anderson. Montreal chose not to upgrade its goaltending tandem from Jake Allen and Samuel Montembeault, and a veteran like Edmundson won't be on the back end to provide support, either. Montreal has to address its defense in other ways if it's going to continue not only generating those key offensive opportunities but leave itself enough of a buffer for it to matter on the scoresheet.\nFantasy outlook: Rafael Harvey-Pinard put up huge numbers across just 34 games, so he'll be one to watch at the start of the season to see if he can repeat it.\nBold prediction: Dach becomes a solid No. 2 center.\nLast season: 31-38-13, 75 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: F Ryan Poehling, F Garnet Hathaway, D Marc Staal\nKey players lost: F Kevin Hayes, F James van Riemsdyk, D Ivan Provorov, D Tony DeAngelo\nMost fascinating player: Sean Couturier. The Flyers have needed a healthy Couturier back in the lineup, not just for what he adds on the scoresheet but in a leadership capacity as well. Philadelphia is deep in rebuilding mode and players like Couturier -- who hasn't played since December 2021 due to back issues -- are hard to come by (or quantify) in support of a team through its time of turbulence. Couturier is a former Selke Trophy winner, and his return should be a beacon of optimism for the Flyers as they move into what's likely to be another difficult season.\nBest case: Philadelphia is far from win-now mode. What qualifies as success is taking a step forward; simply being better than it was a year ago. The Flyers have exciting young players like Cam York who get much-needed experience against NHL talents and begin building confidence. Travis Konecny -- still with the team despite constant rumors he'd be traded -- ignites the Flyers' offense early and that does eventually allow GM Danny Briere to flip him at the trade deadline for valuable assets in Philadelphia's ongoing re-tool. The Flyers are fun, but don't hurt their chances of grabbing another good spot in the draft lottery.\nWorst case: The only downside for Philadelphia is being too good. The Flyers want to stock with the cupboards with another top prospect; that won't happen if they rack up too many wins. Coach John Tortorella getting greedy and pushing his team too hard that it turns into points in the standings hurts their ultimate position in the drafting ones. Briere can't find the right partners to engage with at the trade deadline and Philadelphia loses out there, too. The Flyers wind up picking too high at the draft in June and miss out on what might have been if they'd stumbled more in the regular season.\nX factor: Tortorella. When a coach hates to lose as much as he does, rebuilds can be agonizing. But it's what Philadelphia must go through to truly patch up the organization's holes. Can Tortorella stick to the plan without alienating any of his players in the process? He's managed that so far, it seems. The commitment to being patient has been palpable. It must remain that way for Philadelphia's sake. And riding any of the Flyers' prized prospects too harshly won't pay dividends, either. Philadelphia chose the waiting game, and everyone has to lean into.\nFantasy outlook: With Provorov and DeAngelo out the door, York has a clear path to power-play quarterback duties.\nBold prediction: Couturier will be comeback player of the year.\nTake a look back at some of the NHL's greatest rookie debuts as we await Connor Bedard's first game with the Blackhawks.\nLast season: 26-49-7, 59 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +17500\nKey players added: F Connor Bedard, F Colin Blackwell, F Taylor Hall, F Ryan Donato, F Nick Foligno, F Corey Perry\nKey players lost: D Ian Mitchell, F Jonathan Toews, G Alex Stalock\nMost fascinating player: Bedard. For years, he's been discussed as the NHL's next generational talent upon arrival. Now another set of expectations awaits the 18-year-old in that he's being charged with helping turn around an Original Six franchise that just moved on from icons Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews. Bedard is one of the primary figures of a rebuild that the Blackhawks believe can eventually see them go from a franchise that wins the lottery to one that can once again win the Stanley Cup. In the interim, it appears the more immediate focus for the Blackhawks is watching Bedard handle the demands of what comes with being a top-six, if not, top-line center in his maiden campaign.\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nBest case: Giving Bedard every possible chance to succeed with the understanding there are multiple ways to accomplish that goal. It started when the Blackhawks traded for Hall to give Bedard a veteran top-six scoring winger who also understands the demands that come with being the No. 1 pick in addition to winning a Hart Trophy. Bedard will likely receive the 5-on-5 and power-play minutes needed in order for him to start tapping into his potential as a top-line center. Those are a few of the on-ice avenues the Blackhawks could take. Another is ensuring they continue to add more to a farm system that is already considered to be among the strongest in the NHL.\nWorst case: Not doing enough to give their future the strongest possible chance for long-term success. While Bedard is now the centerpiece of their rebuild, he is not the only young player on the roster or trying to make the roster out of camp. The Blackhawks watched Philipp Kurashev score a career-best 25 points and average more than 17 minutes in ice time last season. They saw Lukas Reichel spend most of the season in the AHL only to emerge as full-time player in March who finished with seven goals and 15 points in 23 games. There's also the contributions that were made by several players under 25 such as Mackenzie Entwistle, Cole Guttman, Wyatt Kaiser, Boris Katchouk, Isaak Phillips, Taylor Raddysh, Filip Roos and Arvid Soderblom.\nX factor: Kevin Korchinski and Alex Vlasic. What they've both done in training camp is present the Blackhawks with two more prospects who appear ready to take the next step. Finding defensive consistency was an area of concern for a Blackhawks roster that was a consistent bottom five team in several defensive categories such as goals allowed per 60 and scoring chances allowed per 60. Enter Korchinski and Vlasic. Korchinski played last season for the WHL's Seattle Thunderbirds in a top-four role that saw him finish with 11 goals and 73 points in 54 games. Vlasic spent the majority of last year in the AHL but was a late-season call up who averaged more than 19 minutes in his six-game cameo.\nFantasy outlook: Defenseman Seth Jones projects to lead Chicago's blue line in scoring, with ease, in amassing 50 points or so and a good number of shots and blocked shots. Playing with Bedard at even strength and with the extra skater will boost Jones' fantasy potential.\nBold prediction: Bedard scores at least 35 goals.\nLast season: 23-47-12, 58 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: D Radko Gudas, F Alex Killorn, D Ilya Lyubushkin\nKey players lost: F Derek Grant, D Kevin Shattenkirk\nMost fascinating player: Jamie Drysdale. What has made the Ducks' future rather promising is the young talent they possess in the form of Mason McTavish, Troy Terry and Trevor Zegras. It's a list that includes Drysdale with the caveat that he's only had one full season considering he sustained a season-ending injury just eight games into the 2022-23 campaign. Getting a healthy Drysdale will give the Ducks a top-four, puck-moving defenseman who is one of the faces of a rebuild that has been heralded as having what's believed to be one of the strongest assortment of defensive prospects by an NHL club.\nBest case: Everything first-year coach Greg Cronin and his staff implements leads to the Ducks gradually improving over the regular season. One of the reasons why the Ducks hired Cronin is the notion he has used his career to develop the reputation as a developer and teacher who's constantly attempting to develop every part of a player's game. It's possible that Cronin's work could be parlayed into the Ducks winning more than 30 games and finishing with close to 80 points -- something they last achieved in the 2021-22 season only to follow that up with a 23-win campaign that saw them finish with just 58 points for the worst record in the NHL.\nWorst case: 339. The significance of that number is that it'd be one additional goal higher than the amount the Ducks allowed last year to clinch the not-so-coveted distinction of allowing the most goals in the NHL. Exactly how trying was last season for the Ducks? They finished last in shots allowed per 60, scoring chances allowed per 60, high-danger scoring chances allowed per 60 and high-danger goals allowed per 60 while finishing second to last in goals allowed per 60. It's another reason why the decisions to add Gudas, Killorn and Lyubushkin could prove valuable for the Ducks.\nX factor: Whatever happens with Leo Carlsson. Drafting Carlsson over Adam Fantilli with the No. 2 pick of last summer's NHL draft was one that generated a bit of discussion in what was an otherwise straightforward draft. Ducks GM Pat Verbeek stressed how Carlsson eventually became the club's \"unanimous\" decision after what he accomplished playing against older and more physically mature competition as the top-line center for Sweden at the IIHF Men's World Championships. They'll get some feedback on the decision soon, as he made the opening night NHL roster.\nFantasy outlook: Outside of dynasty competition, roster hopeful Carlsson merits monitoring instead of immediately drafting in all but the deepest fantasy leagues. Even if he manages to stick in the NHL for most of this season, a likely role in the bottom six won't reap immediate fantasy dividends.\nBold prediction: The Ducks' anniversary jersey becomes their primary one.\nLast season: 22-44-16, 60 points. Missed playoffs.\nStanley Cup odds: +20000\nKey players added: G Mackenzie Blackwood, F Anthony Duclair, F Mikael Granlund, F Mike Hoffman, D Jan Rutta, F Givani Smith, F Filip Zadina\nKey players lost: D Erik Karlsson, F Andreas Johnsson, F Steven Lorentz, G James Reimer\nMost fascinating player: William Eklund. A torn labrum in late March limited Eklund, who the Sharks drafted seventh in 2021, to just eight NHL games. Still, the Sharks watched one of their top prospects score 17 goals and 41 points in 54 games while playing for the Sharks' AHL affiliate in what was his first season in North American hockey. The Sharks announced at the time of his injury they expected Eklund to return prior to the start of camp. Of course, that announcement was made well before an offseason that has led to the Sharks going through quite a few roster alterations.\nBest case: All their offseason trades help them reach their desired destination of having the strongest possible rebuild. Getting forwards such as Duclair, Granlund and Hoffman hypothetically offers the Sharks some options. For one, those three players give them a line's worth of offensive production they previously did not have. Yet what might become their greatest contribution is the fact all three are pending UFAs the Sharks could plausibly look to move for draft capital at or ahead of the NHL trade deadline. That along with a healthy Eklund playing a full season's worth of games could offer more insight into the Sharks' direction.\nWorst case: Not taking advantage of the ways to improve their future. Whether it be through the draft or trades, the last few years has seen the Sharks add to a prospect base that is led by Will Smith, Shakir Mukhamadullin, Filip Bystedt, Quentin Musty and Eklund. It's possible this season could see them strengthen what they already have. That's what makes their roster headlined by eight pending UFAs an item to watch. Parlaying a number of those players into draft capital and/or prospects would see them continue to build upon what they've done to this point. Failing to capitalize on that, however, could potentially add more time to their rebuild.\nX factor: All the talk about the Sharks possibly flipping parts of their roster ahead of the deadline for draft capital and prospects is made complicated by the fact they can only retain one more salary this season. CapFriendly shows they still have two more years left on Brent Burns' salary at $2.72 million annually while having four more years of Karlsson's contract at $1.5 million annually. One of the items that has allowed teams in the Sharks' position to maximize their leverage at the deadline is the ability to retain salary. Yet this season and next season places the Sharks facing some challenges compared to their counterparts who could be able to offer a contending team a better deal ahead or at the trade deadline.\nFantasy outlook: Whichever defenseman lands on San Jose's top power play -- be it Mario Ferraro or Jacob MacDonald -- deserves a little extra fantasy love from simply falling into that fruitful position.\nBold prediction: The Sharks win the draft lottery."}

(1:17)\nThe NHL is in a torch-passing mood as it enters the 2023-24 season.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights are the reigning Stanley Cup champions, having earned their first title since coming into the league in 2017 as an expansion team. The Seattle Kraken defeated the 2022 champs, the Colorado Avalanche, for their first playoff series win in their second season of existence.\nFor the first time in nine seasons, the top 10 scorers in the NHL were all under 30 years old, including Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson and Vancouver Canucks center Elias Pettersson, both just 24 years old.\nThen there's the rookie class for this season, a remarkably deep collection of talent led by 2023 first overall pick Connor Bedard, who has lifted the Chicago Blackhawks back to relevance before ever appearing in a regular-season NHL game.\nBut not everyone is ready to let go of the torch. Veteran teams like the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins are trying to raise the Cup again after major offseason changes. Meanwhile, the megastars in their prime on the Edmonton Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs are desperate to finally win their first rings.\nIf you haven't kept up with the NHL in the past few months, don't fret, we've got you covered.

Read up before the puck drops on opening night this Tuesday!\nHow to watch the 2023-24 NHL season on ESPN networks -- including 100 exclusive games and the out-of-market package (over 1,050 games).\nThe biggest surprise about the Golden Knights lifting the Stanley Cup might have been that it wasn't the Bruins doing it instead.\nThe 2022-23 Bruins were the most successful regular-season team in NHL history, setting league records for wins (65) and points (135) in a season. The NHL awards confirmed that they had the league's best goalie (Linus Ullmark), best coach (Jim Montgomery) and best defensive forward (Patrice Bergeron), along with a 61-goal scorer in winger David Pastrnak. They were a juggernaut offensively and defensively. The question wasn't if they would win the Stanley Cup, but how long it would take them.\nAnd then they were upset in the first round by the Florida Panthers -- who would go on to face Vegas for the Stanley Cup -- losing at home in a Game 7 overtime that left Boston fans and players in stunned silence.\nIt wasn't just a loss on the ice for the Bruins. The offseason saw Bergeron, their much celebrated No. 1 center and captain, retire after 19 seasons. Their second-best center, David Krejci, retired after 16 seasons. The Bruins had made it their mission to send both of them off as champions. Instead, they have to pick themselves up off the canvas without them.\nThey aren't the only departures from Boston: Wingers Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno, Tyler Bertuzzi and defenseman Dmitry Orlov all switched teams in the offseason, too.\nCan new captain Brad Marchand and the Bruins who remain get back to the playoffs with these lineup holes? Is their defense corps, led by Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm, and goaltending (Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman) dominant enough to contend again? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nIf the Bruins falter, or another of last season's Eastern Conference playoff teams struggles, all eyes are on a trio of Atlantic Division teams that have been rebuilding towards getting back to the playoffs.\nThe Buffalo Sabres have garnered the most interest, having not made the playoffs since 2011. They have a newly minted star center in Tage Thompson and two great young defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.\nThe Ottawa Senators also have a breakout star in forward Tim Stutzle, who joins players like Brad Tkachuk and Claude Giroux in trying to get the Sens their first playoff spot since 2017 under new owner Michael Andlauer.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, who haven't made the playoffs since 2016, hope their mix of established veterans and younger talents finally brings GM Steve Yzerman's plans into sharper focus.\nTake a look back at some of the NHL's greatest rookie debuts as we await Connor Bedard's first game with the Blackhawks.\nBedard, 18, is the latest generational talent who had teams, ahem, \"rearranging their rosters\" in order to maximize their draft lottery odds. Chicago had the third-best odds when it won the lottery to secure the services of Bedard, selecting No. 1 overall for the first time since drafting Patrick Kane in 2007.\nThe hockey world had anticipated Bedard's NHL arrival for years. He was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. He racked up player of the year awards and led the Canadian junior team to two gold medals. Scouts have raved about the quality and accuracy of his shot, which produced 122 goals in 119 games over the past two seasons with the Regina Pats. He's unquestionably the most hyped rookie to arrive in the NHL since another Connor: Oilers star and reigning NHL MVP Connor McDavid, who was drafted in 2015.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBedard arrives during a transitional time for Chicago.\nThe Blackhawks' reputation is still on the mend after the 2021 investigation that made public the sexual assault allegations by former player Kyle Beach against the team's video coach Brad Aldrich during the 2010 season. Stan Bowman, the team's GM and president of hockey operations, and senior vice president of hockey operations Al MacIsaac both resigned in the aftermath, with current general manager Kyle Davidson taking over.\nKane and captain Jonathan Toews, the last on-ice links to the Blackhawks' three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, 2015), both parted ways with the franchise last season. In July, Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz died at 70 years old following an illness.\nBedard's arrival has certainly helped change the vibes for the Blackhawks.\nThe team sold $5.2 million worth of tickets after winning the draft lottery. The Blackhawks tell ESPN that they expect an increase of over 17% in tickets sold and overall 26% higher revenue growth than our initial 2023-24 season projections. They've nearly doubled their full season-ticket packages sold year over year.\nChicago hasn't made the playoffs in three seasons and probably won't again in Bedard's first season -- although the Blackhawks bolstered their rebuilding lineup with familiar names like Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. But they theoretically have their next franchise player and, more importantly, a point of demarcation with the past.\nBedard is far from the only notable first-year player in the NHL this season. In a league that's all about speed, scoring and low salary cap hits, more young players than ever are breaking into the NHL early. Some other rookies to watch this season:\nLogan Cooley had announced he was returning to the University of Minnesota, but instead the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 signed with the Arizona Coyotes ... where he will still play in an NCAA arena this season, but we digress.\nCenter Adam Fantilli, 18, was selected third overall in the 2023 draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets after being projected as the second-best prospect behind Bedard all season. (No. 2 overall was Leo Carlsson of the Anaheim Ducks.) The University of Michigan product won the Hobey Baker as the best men's player in the NCAA last season.\nAnother Michigan alum is defenseman Luke Hughes, who brought some chaotic energy to the New Jersey Devils' playoff run. He's expected to be an offensive force this season on a team that features his brother, star center Jack Hughes.\nGoalie Devon Levi could be entrusted by the Sabres to lead them to their first playoff berth since 2011. He dazzled in a brief stint with them last season.\nThe Maple Leafs made winger Matthew Knies untouchable at the trade deadline last season, and for good reason: The Hobey Baker finalist from Minnesota brings offensive skill and physicality in his game.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nKyle Dubas bet on himself as general manager of the Maple Leafs, entering last season without a contract beyond 2022-23. He seemingly won the wager, as the Leafs advanced past the opening round for the first time since 2004 by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning before losing to the Panthers.\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBut as Dubas' agent and team president Brendan Shanahan worked on a new contract, there was drama brewing. The ask from Dubas went up, and reportedly so did the amount of power he wanted in personnel decisions. Dubas held a news conference that didn't sit well with Shanahan, saying his future in Toronto required \"a full family discussion.\" Ultimately, Shanahan decided to let Dubas walk, hiring former Calgary GM Brad Treliving as his replacement.\nDubas also made it seem like it was Toronto or bust in that news conference, saying, \"I definitely don't have it in me to go anywhere else.\" Then the Penguins came calling after they fired team president Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall and ... well, maybe Pittsburgh isn't like anywhere else.\nDubas was named president of hockey operations and oversaw a search for the team's next general manager before finding the perfect candidate: Kyle Dubas, who will serve in that role for the foreseeable future. The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins, tasked him with two missions: Start thinking about what the next phase of this team looks like while doing everything he can to help the team's veteran core -- Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang -- become Stanley Cup champions for a fourth time since 2009.\nHis first move was a bit of managerial magic: a three-team trade that saw him move out some of the team's cap-problematic contracts while acquiring 33-year-old San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson, who won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman last season. Karlsson scored 101 points in 82 games. Another season like that, and the Penguins might have one more championship push left in them.\nBesides the Karlsson trade, there were other significant trades in the offseason:\nThe Los Angeles Kings acquired center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Winnipeg Jets in a package that included forwards Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi. A 25-year-old restricted free agent, Dubois was handed an eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois gives the Kings one of the deepest groups at center in the West, along with Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault.\nThe Devils, who defeated the New York Rangers for their first playoff series win since 2012, traded for winger Tyler Toffoli, who led the Calgary Flames with 34 goals last season.\nThe Avalanche acquired center Ryan Johansen from the Nashville Predators, who picked up half of his $8 million cap hit for the next two seasons to facilitate the trade.\nAfter scoring winger Alex DeBrincat made it clear that he wouldn't re-sign with the Senators, they sent him to the Red Wings in a trade that included a first-round pick and forward Dominik Kubalik.\nThe Blue Jackets added two veteran defensemen via trade, acquiring Ivan Provorov (Flyers) and Damon Severson (Devils). Severson received an eight-year, $50 million contract extension.\nThe St. Louis Blues benefited from the Philadelphia Flyers' salary dump, as they traded a sixth-round pick for center Kevin Hayes and had Philly pick up 50% of his salary for the remaining three years of the deal.\nSome interesting names ended up in even more interesting locations via free agency:\nThe NHL had a buyout window that was more active than usual. The players changing teams after having the remaining years on their contracts bought out included Jets captain Blake Wheeler, now with the Rangers; Predators center Matt Duchene, who signed with the Stars; winger Josh Bailey, who was traded to Chicago by the New York Islanders after 15 seasons, bought out by the Blackhawks, and then signed a professional tryout contract with the Senators; defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who was bought out by Vancouver and signed with the Panthers; and defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who now has the honor of being bought out by two different teams, with the Flyers ending his time in Philadelphia so he could rejoin the Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Bruins saw their two big trade deadline acquisitions move on. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, who were already stacked on defense, and Tyler Bertuzzi signed a one-year deal to play on Auston Matthews' wing with the Maple Leafs. Michael Bunting, who played with Matthews last season, signed with the Hurricanes. The Leafs also signed free agent defenseman John Klingberg to a one-year deal.\nStar center Ryan O'Reilly, who was picked up at the trade deadline by Toronto, surprised many by signing a four-year deal with the Predators.\nGoalie Joonas Korpisalo, one of the only big-name goalies available as free agency opened, inked a five-year contract with the Senators.\nWinger Alex Killorn, an essential role player on Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup teams, signed a four-year deal with the Ducks after 11 seasons with the Lightning.\nDefenseman Matt Dumba was cap-squeezed out of Minnesota and signed a one-year deal with the Coyotes.\nWinger James van Riemsdyk, defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and winger Milan Lucic all signed with the Bruins. It's a homecoming for Lucic, who was a fan favorite during eight years in Boston (2007-15).\nWinger Vladimir Tarasenko didn't find the deal he wanted in free agency, changed agents and then inked a one-year contract with the Senators.\nAmong the players who avoided free agency by re-signing with their teams are two Golden Knights playoff heroes in forward Ivan Barbashev (five years) and goalie Adin Hill (two years); goalie Tristan Jarry, who signed a five-year deal to stay with the Penguins; defenseman Scott Mayfield (seven years), who remained with the Islanders; goalies Frederik Andersen (two years) and Antti Raanta (one year), who stayed with the Hurricanes; and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who remained with the Kings on a two-year deal.\nOne name still available as the season begins: Patrick Kane, who split last season with the Blackhawks and Rangers before undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in the summer. He plans to play in 2023-24 and is waiting to see what the standings look like as the season progresses.\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews ended any speculation about his pending 2024 free agency by signing a four-year contract extension in August that gave him the highest annual average salary since the NHL instituted the cap: $13.25 million, topping the record Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon set in 2022 ($12.6 million).\nOther significant contract extensions included Devils forwards Jesper Bratt (eight years, $7.875 million AAV) and Timo Meier (eight years, $8.8 million AAV); Ducks forwards Troy Terry (seven years, $7 million AAV) and Trevor Zegras (three years, $5.75 million AAV); Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson (eight years, $8.05 million AAV); Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson (seven years, $6.5 million AAV); Red Wings winger Alex DeBrincat (four years, $7.875 million AAV); Hurricanes center Sebastian Aho (eight years, $9.75 million AAV); and Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin (eight years, $8.25 million AAV).\nThe situation between Mike Babcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets presented an existential question for hockey fans: Is it really a coaching change if a new coach never actually makes it to training camp?\nBabcock was officially hired by the Blue Jackets in July on a two-year deal worth $4 million per season, to much fanfare from the team.\nHe had won a Stanley Cup with Detroit, two Olympic golds with Team Canada, and is 12th all-time with 700 wins. But after he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, stories emerged about Babcock's mental abuse of players with the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. His tactics would be under scrutiny as he returned to the NHL.\nOn the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast in September, former NHL player and current TV analyst Paul Bissonnette claimed that Babcock asked Columbus captain Boone Jenner to show him his cellphone camera roll before displaying those photos via AirPlay on the coach's office wall.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nFormer NHL defenseman Mike Commodore, who played for Babcock and has been a long-standing critic of the coach, said he heard this behavior also occurred during Babcock's time coaching the Maple Leafs.\n\"It happened with a few other players in Columbus, too,\" Commodore said in a video posted to X. \"I don't want to use any names, but in particular [it involved] a young, very highly touted prospect.\"\nThese claims were enough to spark an NHLPA investigation of the situation, as new executive director Marty Walsh interviewed Blue Jackets players in Columbus. The NHLPA then presented its findings to the NHL, and the two entities informed the Blue Jackets. On Sept. 17, Babcock resigned as head coach of the Blue Jackets days before the start of training camp, with associate coach Pascal Vincent taking over as head coach.\n\"Upon reflection, it has become clear that continuing as head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets was going to be too much of a distraction,\" Babcock said in a statement released by the team.\nBlue Jackets management took the blame for the debacle. \"We went through a process earlier this summer prior to hiring Mike Babcock as our head coach, but we got it wrong and that's on us,\" team president John Davidson said.\nIn other less contentious NHL coaching moves, the Capitals parted ways with Peter Laviolette, who quickly found a new gig coaching the Rangers after they fired Gerard Gallant. The Capitals hired 44-year-old Leafs assistant Spencer Carbery. The Predators hired Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette, who was a Jack Adams finalist in 2022 with Florida. Ryan Huska replaced Darryl Sutter in Calgary, while Greg Cronin took over for Dallas Eakins in Anaheim.\nThe NHL has three outdoor games scheduled for the 2023-24 season:\nThe Oilers and Flames play at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL Edmonton Elks, in the Heritage Classic on Oct. 29.\nThe Kraken host the Golden Knights in the 2024 Winter Classic at T-Mobile Stadium, home the Seattle Mariners, on Jan. 1.\nMetLife Stadium -- which saw both a Taylor Swift concert and Taylor Swift, Chiefs fan, this year -- hosts another historic event in February 2024. The Devils will host the Flyers on Saturday, Feb. 17, in an outdoor night game. The Islanders will host the Rangers on Sunday, Feb. 18. The event will mark the first time four NHL teams have played outdoor games at the same venue in front of fans.\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend will be held on Feb. 2 and 3 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\nThe 26-year-old Edmonton star set new career highs with 64 goals and 153 points in 82 games last season, winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP for the third time and the Pearson Award for NHLPA player of the year for a fourth time. His point total jumped by 30 and his goals by 20 year over year. No one's really sure what his ceiling is statistically.\nUnfortunately for McDavid and his superstar teammate Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers have had a ceiling in the playoffs. After losing in the conference finals last season, Edmonton fell to the Golden Knights in the second round this season. McDavid and Draisaitl have yet to play for a Stanley Cup since McDavid entered the league in 2015. Is this the year?\nWhile teams like the Avalanche, Golden Knights, Lightning, Penguins and Kings seek another championship after recently winning the Cup, other teams considered among the top contenders are seeking to end significant droughts.\nThe Hurricanes (2006), Devils (2003), Stars (1999), Rangers (1994) and Oilers (1990) all have gone well over a decade without hoisting hockey's grail, while teams like the Minnesota Wild and Panthers have never won the Cup.\nAnd then there are the Maple Leafs, seeking their first Stanley Cup win since 1967 -- a 55-season drought that's the longest in the NHL.\nFinally, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin continues his journey to break one of the most seemingly unbreakable records in sports: Wayne Gretzky's 894 career NHL goals.\nAfter tallying 42 goals in 2022-23, Ovechkin has 822 career goals at the start the season. That's 72 goals to tie and 73 goals to pass Gretzky. So while the record-breaking moment probably has to wait until at least next season, it'll be fun to see how close Ovechkin can position himself to it during 2023-24.\nUnless he decides to score 73 goals and be done with it. We're never one to underestimate Mr. Ovechkin as a goal scorer."}
{"title": "Is Davante Adams satisfied? The Raiders star opens up ahead of MNF against his former team", "date": "2023-10-09 13:13:07", "text": "Tristan H. Cockcroft says Raiders WR Davante Adams remains locked in as a WR1 and could have additional motivation in Week 5 against his former team. (1:05)\nHENDERSON, Nev. -- Davante Adams has been busy since agreeing to a blockbuster trade in March 2022 to leave the only professional organization he had ever known in the Green Bay Packers to join the team he grew up rooting for in the Raiders. For starters, he signed a five-year contract with Las Vegas worth $140 million.\nSince then, he's been targeted a league-leading 229 times in 21 games. Adams has also caught 133 passes for 1,913 yards and an NFL-high 17 touchdowns -- including 33 receptions for 397 yards and three touchdowns this season. He was also named first-team All-Pro for the third straight year and selected to his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl after the 2022 season.\nYet despite all of his individual brilliance, the Raiders are 7-14 with him, including a frustrating 1-3 start to this season with a fresh controversy seemingly enveloping the franchise on a weekly basis.\nSurely, this couldn't have been what Adams was expecting when he left Titletown for Sin City.\n\"I didn't really have any expectations,\" Adams told ESPN.com recently. \"But it's not what I wanted, for sure. Obviously, I wanted to come here and have a big impact, continue to play at a high level and win games. And a lot of those things have happened -- just not the winning part. But I've just got to continue to do more and keep demanding greatness and consistency for my teammates.\n\"It's a gamble sometimes. You never really know.\"\nAt a position known for being full of me-first players, Adams, 30, is cut a bit differently. He doesn't preen or call attention to himself. He simply goes about his job while making other players look silly -- the defensive backs trying to cover him. It caught Raiders receiver Jakobi Meyers off guard when Meyers joined Las Vegas in free agency this offseason.\n\"He'd go out there, run hard, take hits, get back up, make the exciting play, make the basic play, the routine fundamental play,\" Meyers said. \"I mean, he's just a well-rounded receiver. He really can do it all. And the want to. He wants to do it all. He wants to be out there every play. He's inspirational, man. ...We're just chasing him.\n\"He has every right to be a diva, he definitely could be. But that's not him, man. He's a hard-working, head-to-the-ground, go-make-my-plays type of guy. So, respect to him.\"\nBut the losses are piling up, as the Raiders have suffered from blown leads, failure to get over the hump and losses in winnable games. After all, the Raiders are 5-11 in one-score games since the start of the 2022 season, a win percentage that's 27th in the NFL.\nAnd with his old team coming to town for \"Monday Night Football\" (8:15 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN) and Cheeseheads threatening to take over Allegiant Stadium, Adams is not about to make any concrete \"claims\" about his future, even as his concerns battle the team-first mentality and work ethic which has earned him praise throughout the Raiders' locker room.\n\"What's most important to me is going to the Super Bowl. I've been to four NFC championship games in Green Bay in eight years,\" Adams said. \"So, I've won a lot of games in the regular season. I've got a lot of stats. What I haven't done is check that box of winning the Super Bowl.\n\"I'm trying to create something special here. I can only do so much on my individual end. ... you don't fluke into the Super Bowl; you do it a certain way to win the Super Bowl.\"\nTHE BALL THROWN by rookie quarterback Aidan O'Connell -- who got the start in Week 4 when starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was ruled out due to a concussion -- was behind Adams as he went across the middle on a deep route at SoFi Stadium. Adams took a shot to his right shoulder when Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Michael Davis drove him into the artificial turf, stayed on the ground and was taken to the locker room for examination.\nIt was early in the second quarter, and despite being listed as questionable to return, Adams was back on the field before halftime. He caught eight passes in the second half to help lead a Raiders' comeback effort that fell short. Adams sat out practice on Thursday and Friday and was a limited participant Saturday due to that shoulder and is listed as questionable to play Monday.\n\"He's a warrior, and to come back in and play the way that he did after that, I give him, obviously, all the credit in the world,\" Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said. \"He's a tough son of a gun and what a great team player.\n\"One of the more unique players and people that I've been around.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nOn the field, McDaniels said Adams has seen \"every defense known to mankind\" and still excels.\n\"He's got a perspective that's very unique and rare,\" McDaniels said. \"And his skill and his talent, it's at the highest level. He plays at an incredible speed, his hands, his length, his reach, his ability to twist and turn and make tough catches. I mean, it's a privilege to coach guys like that because you don't get to see that every day.\"\nOff the field?\n\"He's a very mature guy,\" McDaniels said. \"He's a great dad, great husband, great son, great friend and very honest and open with his dialogue about whatever. Any way he could help the team -- he's an incredible captain.\n\"Just a really unique individual, unique player, special in every way. Hall of Famer.\"\nBut Adams is also human with an inner conflict -- trying to balance the Raiders' inability to forge a consistent and successful path with his personal success -- that's pulling him in different directions. In the spring, after the Raiders moved on from nine-year starting quarterback Derek Carr, his college teammate at Fresno State, and signed Garoppolo, Adams said he didn't see \"eye-to-eye\" with the Raiders' decision makers.\nAfter a disappointing Week 3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Adams said he didn't have \"time to wait around\" for the Raiders to get right and talked about the \"culture\" having to change.\nBut slip-ups aside, Adams continues to build his résumé for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Consider: With a touchdown catch against the Packers, he will pass Antonio Brown and Jimmy Graham for the fourth-most TD catches in prime-time games in NFL history with 32. Only Hall of Famers Jerry Rice (46), Randy Moss (44) and Terrell Owens (34) have more. Plus, with 802 career catches for 10,034 yards and 90 TDs, Adams ranks 14th on the all-time TD reception list and is about two seasons away from joining the NFL's top 20 lists in catches and receiving yards, barring injury.\nHe's not the fastest or the quickest, but Adams is eternally open.\nRaiders cornerback Nate Hobbs credits Adams' use of leverage and his ability to change direction on a dime. That, and Adams never taking a play off. It seems simple, but he runs every route as if the ball is coming his way, even if it's a run play, making it a battle of conditioning and, thus, attrition, with an unsuspecting defensive back.\n\"He always has a plan, and it could change in a split second,\" said Hobbs, who wanted one-on-one reps with Adams in his first camp with the Raiders and quickly found out. \"He'll leverage you inside and you don't expect that, so he'll convert and have me on a different route. He makes every route look the same.\n\"Plus, the way he goes and gets the ball when it's in the air, he's like on a Steph Curry level. You know how Steph could shoot and he can close his eyes and hit it? Last year several times, he couldn't even see the ball, and he caught the ball. With one hand. Like, he's on that level, that Curry level when it comes to catching balls. He's a real expert at it. All that together makes it really tough to guard. He's unpredictable.\"\nWHILE MORE THAN a few of the names and faces have changed, a certain sense of familiarity is bound to come over Adams on Monday night when he looks across the field and sees that iconic gold and dark green helmet with the oversized 'G' on the side. The helmet he wore from 2014, when the Packers drafted him in the second round, through 2021, when it was simply time to go and get closer to his family and friends on the West Coast.\nIt's a helmet Adams wore as he advanced to the precipice of the Super Bowl four times, with the Packers losing in the NFC Championship Game in 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2020.\n\"It'll be weird,\" Adams said with a grin. \"I'll get over it by the time the game starts. But going over there, coming out of the tunnel, seeing them over there, it'll be weird. I haven't experienced, obviously, I haven't played against the Packers before, so it'll be fun.\n\"It'll be good to see some [familiar] faces and compete against those boys at a different level, too.\"\nPat McAfee breaks down everything that has gone wrong in Josh McDaniels' reign as Raiders coach.\nComing out of the game with a win, though, would be more than that for Adams and the Raiders. Perhaps it would halt, momentarily at least, the narrative that Adams is unhappy. That the Raiders will have to at least entertain the thought of trading him for a bounty of picks, even if the dead money hit -- $7.85 million this year, $23.55 million in 2024 -- would be daunting.\nA victory could confirm what Adams has been saying all along -- that the Raiders have too much talent to not be relevant in the second half of the season.\n\"I'm just trying to stay centered and stay focused on the ultimate goal, which is winning games,\" he said. \"It's the cliché answer, but that's really all I can do. ... My job is to play, and the front office, their job is to do what they do. It's just the easiest way to not live on a roller coaster, this up and down world, just take care of what I can take care of. And as much as I can contribute to that, I'm going to do that.\n\"And that's how you build a winning culture. So, when I [say] we haven't established a winning culture, it's more about what we can do as players, more than the philosophies and the ideas. Because everything that they preach here, the way we talk about it and the way they want it done, is the right way.\"\nYes, even when it comes to not seeing eye-to-eye on certain things.\nOf course, Adams could not have foreseen Carr being cut and leaving for the New Orleans Saints after less than one season together in Las Vegas. But Carr was not the only reason Adams, who rocked a Charles Woodson jersey for third-grade picture day while saying he wanted to play for the Raiders, came to southern Nevada.\nAnd until Garoppolo was concussed, Adams was building a certain and sudden trust with his new quarterback. Not an easy thing to do considering Adams has really only had two quarterbacks since graduating from Palo Alto High School in 2011 -- Carr at Fresno State, Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and Carr again with the Raiders.\n• Biggest questions, risers, fallers »\n• Graziano judges overreactions »\n• Fantasy winners and losers (ESPN+) »\n• Full Week 5 scoreboard » | More »\n\"Jimmy's an easy guy to work with because he's one of the best that I've been around at any position, let alone quarterback, of taking accountability,\" Adams said. \"Not taking anything away from Derek and Aaron, but Jimmy does a good job of not coming in acting like he knows everything. He's open to suggestions and me talking through ways that I've done in the past.\"\nWhich brings it full circle to Adams saying it's all a gamble anyway. And with this being Las Vegas, he just doesn't want to crap out, or roll snake eyes.\n\"Some things are going to work out better in the offseason, whether it's free agents or if it's draft picks,\" said Adams, who got off to a slow start in his career with 88 catches and four touchdown catches in his first two seasons combined, and did not go over 1,000 yards receiving in a single season until his fifth year in the NFL.\n\"It's also a process of this thing takes time to develop, so you can't count your chickens until they hatch. Because if we would've done that, then there would've been no Davante Adams at this point.\""}

Each time the Vikings kicker lined up for a field goal -- a 49-yard attempt on the first possession of overtime and then an attempt to win the game with a 35-yarder on the final play -- the same thing happened.\n“The Packers fans started screaming, ‘He’s going to miss it,’” Carlson recalled. “And of course, he did. The Packers fans kept saying, 'We love Daniel Carlson.'\"\nHans, Daniel’s father, didn’t say a word.\nIt wasn’t a great weekend for the Carlsons from the start. Hans had a layover in Chicago because he was on his way back from watching his youngest son, Anders Carlson. Then a redshirt freshman at Auburn, where he followed in Daniel’s footsteps, Anders missed a 52-yard field goal in the fourth quarter of a 22-21 loss to LSU.\nFast-forward more than five years, and the Carlsons won’t be forced to pick watching one son over the other. On the stage of \"Monday Night Football\" at Allegiant Stadium (8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC), Daniel, the Las Vegas Raiders' All-Pro kicker, and Anders, the Packers rookie who has yet to miss a kick this season, will finally play in the same game.\n“What will that be like?” Jodie Carlson, their mother, said to ESPN during a joint interview with her husband, Hans, just days before kickoff. “No idea because it’s never happened before.”\nIn fact, it will be the first time the entire Carlson crew -- including oldest son, Nils, who is flying in from Sweden -- will be in the same place at the same time since Anders’ wedding in June 2022.\nFor years, Hans and Jodie tried to maximize their opportunities to see their two kicking sons perform. The boys were never in high school at the same time, so when Daniel kicked at Auburn, Anders was back in Colorado Springs. By the time Anders became Auburn’s kicker in 2018, Daniel was already in the NFL, having been drafted in the fifth round by the Vikings that year.\nThe only time they were on the same team was at Auburn in 2017, Daniel’s final season, but Anders redshirted.\nAnders admitted recently he had no idea how his parents managed to see as many of their games as they did, although Jodie’s job as a flight attendant for United helped, and it’s still a wonder how they’ll keep this up with two kids in different NFL cities.\n“Well, Week 5’s easy,” Anders joked, referring to Monday night’s game. “There’s only one spot to go to.”\nThe Carlson kids were typical hypercompetitive brothers -- or at least typical for having a father who came to the United States from Sweden on a tennis scholarship to the University of Alabama. That’s where Hans met Jodie, whose father played baseball for the Crimson Tide.\nBest of NFL Nation• Is Davante Adams satisfied?\n• Kicking Carlsons ready for first battle\n• Porter Jr. makes case to start\n• Broncos struggling vs. the run\n• Kelce returns to deliver big plays\n• Bills face tough road with injuries\nNils, the oldest of the three, could be credited with turning his younger brothers into kickers.“Nils was the one who made them good because he was a soccer goalie,” Hans said. “They used to take shots at him every summer, thousands of shots.”Hans coached them in tennis and encouraged them to try everything from golf to basketball. According to Anders, the games of driveway basketball with Daniel were more than just friendly pickup games, and the tennis matches still go on to this day.“I was the better basketball player,” Anders insists. “He was the more physical guy, though. He had the height, so those were even matches. My dad’s a tennis coach, so a lot of tennis matches. Playing soccer, whatever it was, we were always competing.”Daniel's version is slightly different.“I’m like 1 million-and-0 in brotherly competition,\" Daniel said. \"But we’re 0-0 overall in football competition. So this is really special. … This will be a first and hopefully not a last.”Of all the commonalities between Anders and Daniel, current Packers special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia might be the most important one. Most bios of Bisaccia don’t even include his stop at Auburn. But he spent a month there early in 2013 between NFL jobs with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dallas Cowboys. In that brief time, he recruited Daniel. The two would be reunited in 2018 with the Raiders, where Bisaccia ran the special teams.The Raiders signed Daniel a few weeks after the Vikings cut him the day after the debacle in Lambeau, just two games into his NFL career. Bisaccia helped turn Daniel into one of the NFL’s most consistent kickers. In six seasons with the Raiders, he has made 90.1% of his field goals.This offseason, Bisaccia went to bat for Anders, and the Packers took him in the sixth round as they were looking to replace longtime kicker Mason Crosby. After a rocky training camp and preseason, Anders to date has avoided the kind of struggle Daniel had early in his career with the Vikings. He has made everything so far: 5-for-5 on field goals, including a 52-yarder against the Chicago Bears in Week 1, and 9-for-9 on extra points.“I think the thing that's been good for Anders is some of the difficulties that Daniel has had, Anders has had the opportunity to learn from,” Bisaccia said. “So I think that's the one thing probably that he's taken from his brother, but I still think the guiding force to those two is the dad. Dad's an ultracompetitive tennis guy, and I think he's really been a force for both of those guys.”The Packers drafted Anders Carlson in Round 6 of the 2023 NFL draft. After four games, he has yet to miss a field goal attempt (5-for-5) or PAT (9-for-9). Mark Hoffman-USA TODAY SportsLast month, when the NFL season began, the Raiders opened at the Broncos.

{"title": "Bulls' outlook for 2023-24: 'This is the year where we have to prove it'", "date": "2023-10-09 13:35:21", "text": "Quenton Jackson storms through the lane and delivers a posterizer on Andre Jackson Jr. (0:19)\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- THROUGHOUT his first nine seasons with the Toronto Raptors, DeMar DeRozan got used to his team traveling to a location outside of Toronto for the season's first week of practice -- a tradition many NBA teams follow in an effort to build chemistry. So after completing his first season with the Chicago Bulls in 2022, DeRozan began asking what the Bulls' plans were for their next training camp.\nDeRozan was surprised to hear the answer: Chicago, again.\nThe Bulls had not held an out-of-state training camp since 1985, when they were hosted by Beloit College in Wisconsin. Yet DeRozan remembered fondly how a road training camp brought on a camaraderie with his teammates.\n\"Sometimes you've got to get outside your house and do something adventurous,\" DeRozan told ESPN. \"Find anything to bring y'all closer.\"\nChicago's management took DeRozan's suggestion and ran with it, getting buy-in from the entire organization. The result? The Bulls hosted training camp at Belmont University in Nashville, the team's first out-of-state training camp since Michael Jordan's second year in the NBA.\nThe players played Top Golf together; went to team dinners, pranking 19-year-old rookie Julian Phillips with a $13,000 dinner bill -- \"I didn't even know food could cost that much,\" he wrote on his Instagram -- and toured the Tennessee Titans' facility, where DeRozan showed off some uncanny quarterbacking skills.\nHere's @DeMar_DeRozan casually launching the ball from the 10 to the opposite 20 😳 pic.twitter.com/NWiUzX1kyB\nIt was Chicago's way of trying to give its team a fresh start, even though its roster is nearly the same as it was one year ago when it lost in the play-in tournament to the Miami Heat and missed the postseason.\n\"We got to get back to the postseason,\" Bulls guard Zach LaVine told ESPN. \"Obviously we did that our first year and didn't have a good first-round result. ... Everybody has their own personal expectations and expectations as a team. For us, it's consistency and [making] sure we're playing after the 82nd game.\"\nThe Bulls are entering their third season with a team built around the core of DeRozan, LaVine and Nikola Vucevic. But while the top teams in the Eastern Conference shook up their rosters this offseason, the Bulls doubled down on continuity, believing the ceiling on their team is higher than their record so far has shown.\nAfter a fast start to their first season together fueled by stellar point guard play from Lonzo Ball, the Bulls made the 2022 playoffs, before being dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. This year's roster is nearly identical to that team. The Bulls are bringing back their top seven players by minutes played from the 2022-23 season, each of whom were also on the 2021-22 squad. Aside from a few tweaks -- signing Jevon Carter and Torrey Craig in free agency -- this team is virtually the same, with both coming off disappointing finishes. But the plan isn't just to run it back, as the preseason trip to Nashville showed.\n\"One of the things we talked about, you're bringing back the same group, we have to do something different,\" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. \"You can't just do the same exact thing and expect different results.\"\nNO TRIO IN the NBA played more minutes together (1,642) last season than DeRozan, Vucevic and LaVine. Yet the Bulls were outscored during those minutes by 13 points.\nChicago found its groove as a team after the All-Star break, going 14-9 and upsetting Toronto during the play-in tournament. But even during that stretch, the team was outscored by nine points in 492 minutes after the break when its top three players shared the floor.\nThe tricky part for Chicago is that all three players played well individually throughout the season.\nDeRozan continued to be a master in the midrange, making a league-best 317 midrange shots last season (134 more than any other player) while ranking second in clutch points, trailing only De'Aaron Fox, the NBA's inaugural Clutch Player of the Year. Vucevic, who received a three-year contract extension during the offseason, played in every game last season and finished with a 57% effective field goal percentage and shot 59% on 2-pointers, both of which were career bests. After being slowed at the start of the season coming off offseason surgery, LaVine averaged 27.2 points and shot 52% from the field over the final two months.\n\"We've all had really good seasons, but we haven't put it together as a team,\" LaVine said. \"This is the year where we have to prove it. You have to put pen to paper. Three years is a lot of time to show what you have.\"\nWhen the Bulls assembled this trio, they envisioned Ball as the point guard who could serve as the connector for their offense, which ranked 24th in the NBA last season despite having three dynamic scorers.\nThe Bulls were 27-13 and in first place in the Eastern Conference when Ball played his last game in January 2022. Since then, they have gone 47-57 in his absence. It's why Ball called the Bulls one of the NBA's big what-ifs during an appearance on Trae Young's podcast this summer, saying he believes Chicago had built the \"perfect team around him.\"\n\"That's part of the reason why this team is still together,\" Ball told ESPN. \"I actually think we're still trying to play the same way as if I was still here. It's not like we're getting away from the core values that I had on the court. We're trying to keep it fast pace, go, get out and play defense. Everything is kind of in tune for me to come back, whenever that is.\"\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Win projections for 30 teams\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBall has already been ruled out for the 2023-24 season after undergoing cartilage transplant surgery in March, his third knee surgery since his last appearance in an NBA game.\n\"Guys have been accustomed to him not playing,\" Donovan told ESPN. \"It's been two years now.\"\nKnowing Ball won't be available has helped the team manage expectations going into this season, compared with last season, when they continually held out hope that a Ball comeback would save them.\n\"I think last year we were thinking, 'When Lonzo comes back, it'll be different,'\" Vucevic said on media day. \"I think this year we have a clear picture that he's not going to be back. We have to find other ways to run our offense without putting so much pressure on Zach and DeMar handling the ball and scoring, doing everything.\"\nPart of that involves modernizing an offense that averaged 28.9 3-point attempts per game a season ago, the fewest in the NBA. Bulls executive vice president Arturas Karnisovas said on media day that the team was looking to play faster, but DeRozan explained that might not look like what fans are expecting.\n\"People get so caught up in the word fast like it's a million miles per hour up and down the court,\" he said. \"Showtime Lakers. Trying to put up 140 points.\n\"The fast aspect of it is just faster decision making. Quicker decision making. Not necessarily just up-and-down, up-and-down. Shot. Shot. But understanding how to be more effective by making faster and quicker decisions on the go. We do have the personnel to be able to do that\"\nWhile Ball remains hopeful he'll return to the Bulls in 2024-25, it remains to be seen which teammates he'll be rejoining.\nRival teams have checked in with the Bulls about LaVine's availability, team and league sources told ESPN, but no team has been willing to meet Chicago's reportedly large asking price. LaVine, 28, is owed $129 million over the next three seasons and owns a $48.9 million dollar player option in 2026-27.\nLaVine says being the subject of trade speculation has not bothered him.\n• Sign up and play for free!\n• 10 tips to help you win your league\n• Sleepers, breakouts and busts\n• \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list\n\"My camp isn't putting them out,\" LaVine said. \"I committed to the Bulls when I signed my five-year deal. So until I'm not, I'm committed to the Bulls. I've always brought professionalism and consistent play and that's what I'll continue to do.\n\"I love Chicago, I've always wanted to be in a place that wanted me and Chicago showed me that. But obviously trade rumors are part of the business. Are they wanted? No. But I'm a grown man, I've been traded before. I know how to deal with them. You have to take it that way, it's a business, so I don't get too upset.\"\nMeanwhile, DeRozan, 34, is entering the final season of his contract and is set to earn $28.6 million. The Bulls have expressed interest in re-signing DeRozan to a long-term deal and the two sides have had preliminary talks negotiating an extension, sources told ESPN.\n\"We have to make sure this is the right group,\" Karnisovas said at media day. \"I believe in them, I have faith in them and going into the season we'll see how the season is going to play out.\"\nDespite the team's struggles, DeRozan remains committed to winning in Chicago. The team and city accepted him after he spent three seasons in San Antonio feeling like he was in NBA obscurity. Now DeRozan wants to finish his story by bringing the Bulls postseason success the franchise has been starved for since their last title in 1998.\n\"I told a couple guys last year, 'I want to see you win. I want y'all to witness what it feels like to win and what comes with winning and being appreciated and called a winner,'\" DeRozan said. \"That's just my optimistic mindset when it comes to this. I put my all into it.\n\"As much as it's sucked losing, there's always a beauty in the journey. ... Everything can't go fine and dandy, but with that how do you accept the challenge that comes with it. That's my mindset when I look at it, this is a hell of a journey, let's make this journey worth it.\""}
{"title": "European women's review: Greenwood red baffles, late goals a theme", "date": "2023-10-09 13:47:43", "text": "Sophie Lawson reacts to a 1-1 WSL draw between Man City and Chelsea, as the hosts have two players sent off. (1:23)\nThere was one major bone of contention in the Women's Super League (WSL) this weekend as those new refereeing standards caused issues again. These are the key talking points from the WSL, along with some highlights from European action.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nYeah, we really have to start with this one, don't we? As highlighted last week, there has been a concerted clampdown on fouls, perceived timewasting and dissent in the WSL, but those new rules were pushed to the limit on Sunday afternoon as Manchester City had two players sent off in their 1-1 draw with Chelsea. Chelsea's Guro Reiten scrambled a 96th-minute equaliser to cancel out Chloe Kelly's seventh-minute opener.\nBut it was a match that, ultimately, had very little football in it after the 37th-minute sending off of City captain Alex Greenwood for a second yellow card as she apparently took too long (a whole 26 seconds) over a free kick. In total, referee Emily Heaslip brandished 11 cautions -- three for City's Kelly, Laia Aleixandri and Jill Roord in protest at the decision -- including second yellows for Greenwood and then Lauren Hemp in the 81st minute, as most fouls or dissent seemed to carry an automatic booking.\nRather than adding a layer of protection for the players, or building trust and respect between herself and those on the pitch, Heaslip's interventions left no room for common sense as she followed the letter of the law to the extreme. An engrossing game quickly descended into chaos as the referee took centre stage and ended up on the end of constant booing and chants of \"cheat\" from the home crowd.\nAnyone who regularly watches women's football knows that far too many fouls are let go and players have been put in danger for years by lax officiating. But what we saw in Manchester was a rapid overcorrection that doesn't benefit anyone.\nHeaslip generally sets a high standard for officiating in WSL, allowing games to flow, using her time as a player to read the game and consider the nuances and intent. Yet none of that pedigree was on show at the Joie Stadium as she tried to follow the WSL's new guidance.\nAfter sealing a double of WSL and FA Cup for Chelsea in 2022-23, manager Emma Hayes called their season \"a grind.\" The football had been far from vintage for sizable chunks, but her side were still able to pick up more silverware come the end of the season.\nTwo games into this campaign and there is still the same ragged look to the champions. In the first 37 minutes against City, when it was 11 vs. 11, they were entirely overrun. Even against 10 players after the sending off of Greenwood, the Blues continued to struggle. Fresh legs off the bench helped the visitors settle eventually, as they hit the woodwork three times, but there was an impotence to the team hotly tipped to lift a fifth consecutive WSL crown.\nAway days in Manchester are historically the hardest for the Blues, but their midfield was too easily bypassed, and their attack had no fluency and balance. A lack of fitness to key players -- with Australia star Sam Kerr only coming off the bench at half-time and Erin Cuthbert making her first competitive start since July -- didn't help the ring-rust, but they did enough to claim a draw as Reiten's scrappy equaliser in the 96th-minute took advantage of City being down to eight players, with defender Alanna Kennedy off the pitch receiving treatment. They will have to be better than this, though.\nThere are three coaches who have more than one WSL title: Chelsea's Emma Hayes (six), former Arsenal boss Laura Harvey (two) and Liverpool's Matt Beard (also two). Although Beard's triumphs came in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, he helped set a blueprint in the burgeoning league. Now in his second stint back at Liverpool, Beard's side are going from strength to strength.\nAfter leading the team back to the WSL in 2022-23, following their relegation, the 45-year-old lifted the level of his squad to make them a competitive force again, all the while negating the usual issues that come with the jump back up. Their first season back was dotted with gutsy performances and memorable results as they finished a respectable seventh and, two games into this season, Beard looks to have once again raised the bar.\nAfter a 1-0 opening-day win against Arsenal at the Emirates, where Liverpool nullified their opponents' strengths, the Reds again put in a smart performance in a 2-0 win against Aston Villa with goals from Marie Hobinger and Natasha Flint. It's a long season that will be full of twists and turns. But, after two games, there are signs that the Reds are flourishing; the players are all on the same page, enjoying their football, and their manager is clearly able to get the best out of them.\nAfter an opening-day loss to Manchester City when they struggled to get a foot on the ball, there may have been alarm bells going off for West Ham. But under new coach Rehanne Skinner the Irons played some of their best football in recent memory for a 2-0 win over Brighton.\nHaving gone through a number of different coaches and styles over their five-year stint in the WSL, it has been hard for the club to find an identity. But this win was punctuated with the attacking style that Skinner alluded to before the start of the season, with her frontline putting on a show.\nSummer signing Riko Ueki impressed, having a hand in both goals and spending her 78 minutes on the pitch putting the Brighton defence under constant pressure. And, whether on the front foot or weathering a storm defensively late in the first half, the Hammers remained composed throughout and held out as goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold kept her first clean sheet of the season.\nFrom Arsenal and Chelsea, to Juventus and Real Madrid, game-changing late goals are fast becoming a theme around Europe this season. Cloe Lacasse saved the Gunners in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United on Friday night, while we have covered Reiten's equaliser for Chelsea above.\nBut both Spanish and Italian runners up from last season also left it late against their respective opposition on Saturday. Arianna Caruso's match-winner for Juve against AC Milan came in the 87th minute, while Signe Bruun connected with Olga Carmona's low cross in 90th-minute for Real Madrid to seal a 1-0 win over Villarreal.\nHaving invested heavily over the summer to add more depth and quality to the team, losing key player Caroline Weir to an ACL injury last month has seen the rest of the team required to pick up the slack. Even still, Las Blancas laboured against a Villarreal side who are without a win in Liga F so far this season, before snatching all three points.\nDrifting towards their first loss in five games, Swedish Damallsvenskan side Vittsjö grabbed a last-gasp equaliser in a 1-1 draw against league leaders Häcken as goalkeeper Lainey Burdett struck from a stoppage-time corner.\nTrailing to Rosa Kafaj's ninth-minute effort, the Las Vegan-born shot stopper's gamble paid dividends for Vittsjö as she rose to meet Sarah Stratigakis' floated delivery with the side of her head to salvage a point. It was a goal that kept her team's hopes of finishing in a European berth alive as the fourth-placed side sit five points adrift of a qualification spot with four games left to play."}

{"title": "Just how good is Usman Nurmagomedov?", "date": "2023-10-09 14:14:36", "text": "Three champions put their titles on the line at Bellator 300 on Saturday. Three champions dominated.\nThe event at Pechanga Arena in San Diego showed off some high-level command from two champs and a little workmanlike mastery from the third. Lightweight champ Usman Nurmagomedov did the improbable in the main event, outshining a legend, women's featherweight titlist Cris Cyborg, who'd just put on a thrashing in the co-main. And Liz Carmouche, while not an entertainer in her women's flyweight title defense, got an emotionally challenging job done with unemotional efficiency.\nAs for the \"300\" part attached to the fight card, that's a nice, big number, showing Bellator has persevered since its founding 14 years ago. The promotion has delivered some big moments, as well as some bizarre ones. But was this a milestone for the company or a roadside marker indicating the end is right up ahead? Reports and rumors have been swirling that Bellator is on the verge of being bought by the PFL, putting the promotion's future in doubt. At this point, the only event scheduled is next month's Bellator 301. Is that the last we'll see of Bellator?\nJeff Wagenheim and Brett Okamoto offer some thoughts on all things Bellator -- what happened Saturday night at Bellator 300 and what it means for the fighters' futures, as well as what might happen in Bellator's near future and what it means for the fight promotion.\nWagenheim: Let me begin by pointing out that my sorting of the top 10 is totally unofficial, ESPN-wise, since it's Brett, not I, who decides on our divisional rankings. But I do have an opinion -- surprise, surprise, longtime readers -- and in my view Nurmagomedov has shown himself worthy of a spot.\nWhich spot, though? I'm leaning toward the lower end of the rankings, based on the 25-year-old's lightweight title defense at Bellator 300 and other recent performances. Nurmagomedov is undefeated, just like his cousin Khabib was. Usman has been dominant, just like Khabib. But the level of competition matters. Whereas Khabib Nurmagomedov finished his career with whuppings of Justin Gaethje, Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor, Usman Nurmagomedov's last three wins have come against up-and-down Brent Primus, one-step-in-the-retirement-home Benson Henderson and Patricky \"The Lesser Pitbull\" Freire. This is not the most definitive measuring stick.\nI'd love to see Nurmagomedov face a stiffer test, one that disrupts his flow state. Saturday's fight against Primus seemed to be unfolding in slow motion for Nurmagomedov, who gracefully dodged practically everything thrown his way by maintaining a pace and a distance where he could strike and not get struck back. It was a safe, winning strategy, and the champ showed poise and command. But it felt like he was coasting. We need to see him pushed and see him push back.\nNurmagomedov is slated to next fight in the final of the Bellator Lightweight World Grand Prix against the winner of the Nov. 17 semifinal between Freire and Alexander Shabliy. We've already seen how the champ matches up with \"Pitbull,\" but Shabliy, winner of eight in a row and 15 of his last 16, might give his fellow Russian a run.\nPerhaps down the road, we'll see Nurmagomedov in with the other (and better) \"Pitbull,\" Patricio, or dynamic AJ McKee. Or maybe we can measure him against ESPN's No. 1 lightweight and arguably the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, UFC champ Islam Makhachev. They tussle all the time as training partners at American Kickboxing Academy in California. Oh, to be a fly on the wall at one of their sparring sessions. That might be all we need to form a more precise opinion of where Nurmagomedov belongs in the top 10.\nWagenheim: Cyborg and Carmouche scored finishes at Bellator 301. But that is where the comparison ends.\nActually, that's where the comparison of their current state as fighters ends. In the big picture of women's MMA history, both have been key participants in seminal moments. When Cyborg knocked out Gina Carano -- the sport's first crossover star -- in a 2009 Strikeforce women's featherweight title bout, it was the first time a women's fight headlined a major MMA event. And in 2013, Carmouche fought in the first women's bout in UFC history, falling to Ronda Rousey by -- what else -- armbar submission. But Carmouche nearly finished \"Rowdy Ronda\" early in that fight after gaining back control, and boy would that have changed the story of women's MMA.\nBeyond those breakthroughs, the two women's paths diverge. Carmouche has had a few nice moments over the years, while Cyborg has authored a legendary career. And at Bellator 300, Cyborg showed she is not slowing down. Actually, she is slowing down -- but in a good way. Instead of charging out of her corner on Saturday with the old Cyborg blitz, which won her some highlight-reel quick finishes earlier in her career, Cyborg showed poise in walking down Cat Zingano on the way to a TKO late in the first round. She took Zingano apart more methodically than explosively.\nCyborg is 38 years old, and speed is the first thing to go for a fighter. So, her newfound patience will serve her well. It might be the thing that keeps her near the top of the women's game for years.\nIf the Bellator sale to the PFL goes through, Cyborg will work for the same company as Kayla Harrison and Larissa Pacheco. Fights against those would be two of the biggest in women's MMA, true legacy enhancers for whoever gets her hand raised.\nAs for Carmouche, she is not on Cyborg's level -- now or ever -- but she showed on Saturday that she remains strong and smart four months away from turning 40. Fighting longtime friend and former training partner Ilima-Lei Macfarlane, Carmouche didn't let loose with anything resembling fury but gradually broke down the former champ with leg kicks. And while that low engagement annoyed the crowd, it ensured that the champ would not get caught by a desperate shot. It was a sustainable strategy for Carmouche.\nBut who knows what the future will hold for Carmouche? If the Bellator sale happens and fighters are assimilated into the PFL, would there be a home for the women who fight at flyweight? Stay tuned.\nOkamoto: A couple of weeks ago, in a Five Rounds segment, I wrote that Bellator's bantamweight title fight between Sergio Pettis and Patchy Mix is the most underrated fight for the rest of the year. I challenge anyone to argue any differently.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nPettis is on a six-fight win streak, with his last two coming against tough competition in Patricio \"Pitbull\" Freire and Kyoji Horiguchi. Before that, he faced Juan Archuleta, who is no easy task, either. Pettis is ESPN's No. 7-ranked bantamweight, with a case to be in the top 5. And that's the most stacked division in the sport right now, particularly at the top. Mix might be one of the most underrated fighters in the world right now. He's a guy who finishes fights at 135 pounds and he is bringing a ton of momentum into this title fight. This is just a world-class matchup in a division that's on fire right now -- especially in the UFC. If you added these two to the UFC's roster, on top of what's already going, it would be the strongest division the UFC has had in years.\nThe rest of the Bellator 301 card is very good as well. AJ McKee will continue his new run at lightweight. Ukrainian welterweight champion Yaroslav Amosov is a worthy headliner. But for me, this card is mainly about the 135-pound title fight, which I consider one of the top fights on the MMA calendar.\nOkamoto: To be determined. Rumors of Bellator MMA's demise (or its absorption by PFL) have been swirling for the better part of this year. Showtime's long-term interest in combat sports, in general, would seem to be on its deathbed. If Bellator does hold another event past Bellator 301, it would likely occur in December, although no fights are officially booked at this time. One industry member probably put it best to me in a text message: \"It's up in the air.\"\nFor the sport, it would be great to see Bellator continue to exist on its own, but from a business perspective, this move would probably be well overdue for Showtime -- and its parent company, Viacom. Bellator has some world-class fighters under contract, but as a whole, the promotion has lacked direction and enthusiasm for quite some time now. There have been advanced talks of a PFL acquisition, and that is the outcome I anticipate at the moment.\nBellator president Scott Coker's comment over the weekend that \"these things take time\" was probably the most accurate, insightful update he could provide. The interest and desire are there to combine companies, but all of the sorting out of details takes time. How much time, we'll see. But Bellator's days do seem numbered."}

Or maybe it will be Biles wiping away tears -- or was that an eyelash? -- on the top step of the all-around podium, which featured three Black women for the first time in the sport's history. Or perhaps it will be Biles, 26, tripping over her own feet during her floor performance in the all-around, laughing at herself and then nailing her final tumbling pass.\nReally, it will be all these moments, because Biles is all these things: the most decorated gymnast of all time, a rock for her teammates, a gold standard for a generation of gymnasts, emotional in her return to the sport and unflappable and funny even when her performances don't go precisely to plan.\n\"I was excited being back out here competing, having fun, having that pressure again,\" Biles said after taking gold in the individual event finals on balance beam and floor Sunday afternoon. \"The whole entire experience that we've had at this world championships, I think we learned a lot from it.\"\nTruly the GOAT. 🐐With a gold medal in her final event at #Antwerp2023, @Simone_Biles extends her record as the most decorated gymnast in world championships history with 30 WORLD MEDALS. pic.twitter.com/RADXFOlbfu\nTen years after Biles made her world championship debut in Antwerp, she likely competed in her final world championship here, and it was a memorable one. Team USA won its seventh straight team gold, not with a perfect, dominant performance, but with a gritty one. When 17-year-old Joscelyn Roberson injured her left ankle during vault warmups minutes before competition began, Leanne Wong, 20, a three-time world medalist, stepped in to replace her in the lineups on vault and floor.\n\"I was a little disappointed with my performance, but I think I should be really proud of myself for stepping up and competing the way I did,\" said Wong, who finished seventh in the vault final. \"Winning a gold medal for Team USA is the most unbelievable feeling, hearing the national anthem play and knowing that you were a part of winning a medal for your country.\"\nThe U.S. women's team leaves Antwerp with seven medals. Biles takes home five of her own, which brings her world and Olympic medal count to 37, a record that will stand for a long while -- until she likely adds to it at the Paris Olympics. \"This makes me feel a lot better [about Paris],\" Biles said Sunday. \"We still have meets next year to look forward to and to clean up some work, but it makes me feel really good and a lot more comfortable and competent.\n\"I had to prove to myself that I could still get out here and twist and prove all the haters wrong that I'm not a quitter,\" she said. \"For me, I didn't care [about medals] as long as I'm out there twisting again, having fun and finding the joy for gymnastics again.\"\nThe men's team also made a statement this week, taking bronze in the team final, its first team medal since 2014. Nineteen-year-old Frederick Richard finished third in the all-around and made the floor final, and Khoi Young, 19, took silver on pommel horse and vault. Young became the first U.S. man to win multiple individual apparatus medals since Kurt Thomas and Bart Conner in 1979.\nThe vaults that secured Khoi Young another world championship medal. 🥈He captures silver in the men's vault final, bringing his total medal count at #Antwerp2023 to three.📺 @peacock pic.twitter.com/rcWOnh9v6m\nTeam USA is in a great position less than a year before the Paris Olympics. Here are four more takeaways from world championships as we look ahead to next summer.\nLook no further than the women's team final for proof. Although the U.S. won again, Brazil took silver, winning the first world team medal in the country's history. France earned bronze, its first medal since 1950, and announced its arrival as medal favorites at its home Olympics. China finished in fourth, dropped by a fall on floor and low difficulty scores on vault, but is always in the mix for a team medal.\nLast year's world championship podium included Great Britain (silver) and Canada (bronze), teams that struggled with falls here in Antwerp but are strong contenders when they hit. Both Brazil and China won individual gold medals this year -- in addition to taking silver in the all-around, 2022 world all-around champion Rebeca Andrade of Brazil won vault and took silver on beam and floor, and China's Qiu Qiyuan won uneven bars gold.\nRebeca Andrade IMPECÁVEL nos seus dois saltos no Mundial de Ginástica Artística, em Antuérpia 🇧🇪1º salto: 15.0002º salto: 14.500Nota final: 14.750 pra gritar É CAMPEÃ 🇧🇷 pic.twitter.com/rGcpUIrTiZ\nWithout defending Olympic gold medalists Russia in the mix -- FIG banned the Russian and Belarusian teams after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 -- the podium in Paris is anyone's to grab. Of course, if the U.S. hits -- or even has a fall and a few mistakes, as it had here -- the rest of the world is competing for silver.\nAnd let's not forget Algeria's Kaylia Nemour, who took silver on the uneven bars and delivered her country -- and Africa -- its first world championship medal in history.\nBiles and all-around bronze medalist Shilese Jones, 21, who also took silver on uneven bars, have been rock solid all season and, barring injury or change of plans, look like locks to make the Paris squad. That leaves three open spots, plus alternates.\nWong made a strong case for herself this season, and especially here at worlds, where she did exactly what she was brought to Antwerp to do: hit routines, help the team build strong scores during qualification and step in last-minute in the event of an injury. Roberson also did her part during team qualification, and it's a shame she didn't have the opportunity to perform more than she did.\nShilese Jones shined from every angle to win Bronze! 🥉#Antwerp2023 pic.twitter.com/7WTVPthNtK\n\"I hope when we get home and get an MRI, there is nothing too serious. I hope it's just a sprain,\" said Laurent Landi, who coaches Biles and Roberson. \"She's very, very hungry. And I think that [injury] made her even hungrier for next year.\"\nNone of Biles' Olympic teammates were named to the worlds team, except for alternates Wong and Kayla DiCello, who was also an alternate in Antwerp. But Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Sunisa Lee are all working to be in the mix for a spot on the 2024 team. So too are 2022 national champion Konnor McClain, who's competing at LSU this year; 2012 Olympic all-around champion Gabby Douglas, who announced she's training with an eye on Paris; and the University of Florida's Trinity Thomas, the 2022 NCAA all-around champion, who is back in the gym training and coaching the Gators with plans to return to elite competition next year.\nAnd don't forget the young up-and-comers, several of whom train with Biles, Roberson and Chiles at World Champions Centre in Houston: Tiana Sumanasekera, 16, and Zoe Miller, 17, who will compete at Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, later this month, as well as 15-year-old Dulcy Caylor. Kaliya Lincoln, 16, who trains at WOGA in Frisco, Texas, and is also on the Pan Ams team, is a strong performer on floor and beam.\nRichard, the 2023 NCAA all-around champion from the University of Michigan, took bronze in the all-around, becoming the first American man since 2013 and only the fourth ever to medal in the all-around at worlds. After the medal ceremony, he tossed his stuffed \"Gymbo\" mascot to his mom, Ann-Marie, in the stands and told reporters he hopes his performances -- and his clothing brand, Frederick Flips -- help to grow the sport.\n👀👀👀With just one more rotation to go, 19-year-old American Fred Richard currently sits in first after this routine on the parallel bars.#Antwerp2023 | 📺 @peacock pic.twitter.com/37g1YKQoxH\n\"I want my brand to outlive me in the sport,\" he said. \"I want it to take over the sport for men's and women's gymnastics, and then go to other flipping sports like Parkour and cheerleading.\"\nBut first, Richard said he wants to reach for the performance level of Biles. \"I love just watching the way she competes,\" he said. \"It looks like she's just showing off to the world and that's what I'm trying to replicate. I want to eventually get to that level where I'm just performing for you guys and the gold medal is set.\"\nThe men's team leaves Antwerp with three medals and has a real shot at doing the same -- or better -- in Paris next summer. That speaks to the effectiveness of a move by USA Gymnastics after the Tokyo Games to add bonuses that incentivize gymnasts to attempt more difficult skills in order to compete with countries like Japan and China, the most dominant teams in men's gymnastics this quad.\nIn Antwerp, the Japanese and Chinese teams took gold and silver, respectively, and Japan's Daiki Hashimoto, 22, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, won his second straight world all-around title.\nBACK-TO BACK 🥇Japan's Daiki Hashimoto wins the men's all-around once again. #Antwerp2023 pic.twitter.com/t1IJaacsGV\n\"They're only going to get closer [as a team] from here and more hungry,\" U.S. men's program VP Brett McClure said after the team final. \"Since we've been in a drought, now [an Olympic medal] is attainable.\"\nThe U.S. men's most recent Olympic team medal is a bronze from Beijing in 2008, and they've won the Games only once, in Los Angeles in 1984. \"The reality has set in that they can actually do this,\" McClure said. \"It's not some unicorn off in the distance that doesn't exist.

(0:58)\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- If Sunday night's game against the San Francisco 49ers was supposed to be a measuring stick for the Dallas Cowboys, then the gap between the teams is ginormous.\nSan Francisco pinned a 42-10 loss on the Cowboys at Levi's Stadium that left their locker room as silent as it was in January, when the Niners ended Dallas' season in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\"Didn't see it coming,\" Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said. \"Put everything into it and got punched in the mouth. Called it a couple weeks ago humbling against Arizona, but this may be the most humbling I've ever been a part of. Felt good about the preparation and felt good about everything, honestly, coming into this game, matchups, and they beat us in every aspect.\"\nIt was the second-worst loss of Mike McCarthy's head-coaching career; only a 35-0 shutout against the New England Patriots in his first year with the Green Bay Packers in 2006 was worse. It was the largest defeat of Prescott's career, going back to a 39-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Nov. 19, 2017, during his second season as the Cowboys' starting quarterback.\n\"It's a punch in the gut, it's a kick in the ass, whatever phrase you want to put on it,\" McCarthy said. \"We've been knocked down, clearly. They beat us in all three phases. We will clearly acknowledge it. I've never been a burn-the-tape guy. I think that is a crock of s---. We're going to go through it, make sure we're clear on exactly what the expectations are and make sure we're giving the players what they need to be successful. They played extremely well, and we did not.\n\"I thought we had taken a step as a team. I didn't see this coming. I thought the prep was good this week. I thought we had one of our better Friday and Saturdays of the year. But it's like we talked about before: Sometimes you have a great week of preparation and it doesn't go so well. We did not hit the mark at all.\"\nA defense that allowed a league-low 10.3 points per game through four weeks gave up 21 points through six possessions. A defense that allowed two touchdown passes in the first four games saw Brock Purdy throw four. A defense that recorded 14 sacks in four games sacked Purdy just once. The run defense was hit for 170 yards and two touchdowns on 41 carries.\nOffensively, it was worse for the Cowboys. Prescott completed 14 of 24 passes for 153 yards and one touchdown pass with three interceptions before he was pulled with 8:47 left to play. Running back Tony Pollard lost his first fumble since 2019, his rookie year, in the first quarter. Of the 11 possessions with Prescott at quarterback, nine of them lasted three plays or fewer.\n\"I don't foresee a whole lot of winning grades coming out of this performance,\" McCarthy said. \"I think the most important thing for all of us, and I expressed it, just be accountable for what you did tonight, how you played. We've got to clean our own house up.\"\nThe Cowboys also lost linebacker Leighton Vander Esch in the fourth quarter to a neck injury. Receiver KaVontae Turpin, who scored their only touchdown, did not return following a second-quarter ankle injury. Special teams ace C.J. Goodwin exited in the first half after sustaining a shoulder injury.\n\"This game is not indicative of who we are as an offense,\" Dallas left guard Tyler Smith said. \"This game isn't indicative of who we are as a defense. It's not indicative of who we are as a team.\"\nThe Cowboys will return to California next week for \"Monday Night Football\" against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\"It's still early in the season,\" Dallas linebacker Micah Parsons said. \"I need to help bring these guys together, and we just need to get better. There's no such thing as losing. So tonight we just learned a lesson. We were the team at the end of the stick.\"\nThe Cowboys have dropped their past three matchups with the 49ers, including twice in the postseason.\nFor the 10th time since Jerry Jones took over as owner and general manager in 1989 the Cowboys are 3-2; three times they failed to make the playoffs, including 2019.\nOn Sunday, the gap between the Cowboys and the Niners -- who along with the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas' NFC East rivals, are undefeated -- looked wider than ever.\n\"I mean, obviously, they're further ahead than us right now,\" Prescott said of the 49ers. \"Yeah, so we've got to close that gap and be ready.

(0:18)\nDENVER -- Facing the team that fired him and the coach who maligned him in print, New York Jets offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett enjoyed a day of sweet revenge as his unit racked up 407 total yards Sunday in a 31-21 victory over the Denver Broncos at Empower Field.\nHackett was presented a game ball in a raucous winning locker room, where he was cheered and mobbed by players. He spoke briefly to the team, refusing to gloat or accept any credit. The players did that for him, describing how they badly they wanted to make him a winner.\n\"If someone talks s--- about one of us or one of our coaches or anybody in the building, we want to have their back,\" tight end C.J. Uzomah said. \"So this one was for Hack.\"\nHackett was called out in training camp by Broncos coach Sean Payton, who told USA Today that the 2022 Broncos were undermined by \"one of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the NFL.\" Hackett was fired with a 4-11 record in his first season.\nHe didn't mention the Payton comments during the run-up to the game, players said, but it was on their minds. Before the game, Uzomah gathered his offensive teammates in the end zone and delivered a fiery, profanity-laced pep talk, taking direct aim at Payton.\nIn his brief speech -- caught on video and posted on social media -- Uzomah accused Payton of making the game \"personal.\" After dropping a couple of expletives, he implored his teammates, \"Let's go win this b---- for Hackett!\"\nHackett wasn't available to the media after the win, which snapped a three-game losing streak for the Jets (2-3), but it had to be enormously satisfying. It wasn't an artistic offensive performance -- the Jets were 0-for-5 in the red zone -- but they pounded away at Denver's soft run defense.\nSparked by Breece Hall, who rushed for a career-high 177 yards (including a 72-yard touchdown), the Jets amassed 234 on the ground. Coach Robert Saleh called it \"a special game\" for Hackett and, even though he didn't poke Payton or the Broncos, he made sure mention the Jets' exact yardage total -- 407.\nSpeaking of Hackett, linebacker Quincy Williams told reporters, \"Put some respect on my dog's name.\"\nPayton, who shook Saleh's hand at midfield and then retreated immediately to his locker room, didn't have much to say afterward.\n\"Listen, they played better than us,'' Payton said. \"I credit Robert and that staff, they won the game, that's how I look at it.''\nAsked if he regrets making the comments in late July, Payton said, \"I already addressed that, though it's a fair question. I addressed that the next day.\" At the time, he said it was \"a mistake\" to criticize Hackett in that fashion.\nPayton's postgame news conference ended with that question. With a pause between questions, he took the opportunity to leave the room.\nA month after getting fired by the Broncos, Hackett took the Jets job and was instrumental in luring Aaron Rodgers to the team. When Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 1, it intensified the spotlight on Hackett, whose offense sputtered in the first three games. There was improvement in Week 4, but New York fell to the Kansas City Chiefs 23-20.\nFinally, Hackett was able to enjoy a winning smile.\n\"Even if he wasn't telling us, 'This is personal to me,' you could just look how he carried himself all week, you know what I mean?\" cornerback Sauce Gardner said. \"He had that look on his face, like, man, he really wanted this game. So it meant a lot to get a win for him.\"\nIt wasn't easy. Leading by only three points, Zach Wilson threw an interception deep in Denver territory with 2:14 left in the fourth quarter. With a chance to beat his former coach, Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson coughed it up on a strip sack by Williams. Cornerback Bryce Hall, starting his first game since 2021, scooped up the ball and ran 39 yards for the clinching touchdown.\nNot only did they save their season, but the Jets gave their offensive coordinator a forever moment.\n\"It was a tiny little cherry on top of a huge sundae,\" center Connor McGovern said.\nOr Sunday.\nESPN's Jeff Legwold contributed to this report.

(0:27)\nMINNEAPOLIS -- As he walked through the locker room Sunday evening, Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell stopped to chat with receiver Justin Jefferson. He threw his arm around Jefferson's shoulders, leaned in closely and spoke a few encouraging words into his ear.\nIt was the kind of conversation no coach wants to have. O'Connell's star player left Sunday's 27-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs after a fourth-quarter injury to his right hamstring, and it's a worrisome turn of events for a team that runs its entire offense through him.\nO'Connell said that it's \"still very early\" to project a timetable for Jefferson's recovery -- or if he'd miss any time at all -- but a hamstring injury for a player at his position can be problematic.\n\"We'll get him back as soon as we possibly can,\" O'Connell said. \"There won't be a better teammate in that locker room during the time [he is out]. Hopefully we have him right back this week.\"\nJefferson, who declined comment, hasn't missed a game since the Vikings made him their first-round draft pick in 2020, and he has rarely missed a snap during that period. Since joining the starting lineup in Week 3 of his rookie season, Jefferson has made 53 consecutive starts while playing 92% of the Vikings' offensive snaps.\n\"Justin has done a phenomenal job for the last 3½ years of staying healthy and being healthy every week, which is hard to do,\" quarterback Kirk Cousins said. \"Even with this injury, it makes you pause and be grateful for how healthy he has been.\"\nSunday was Jefferson's quietest day of the season. Cousins targeted him six times, but he dropped one pass -- only his second in the past two seasons -- and caught only three for 28 yards. The injury occurred midway through the fourth quarter when he stumbled while making a cut on a route.\nEntering Week 5, the Vikings had targeted Jefferson on 47 passes, third most in the NFL. Their next-most targeted receiver was rookie Jordan Addison, who had been targeted 20 times. (Tight end T.J. Hockenson ranked second on the team with 31 targets.) Addison, the Vikings' first-round pick, caught a career-high six passes for 69 yards and a touchdown Sunday.\n\"Jordan is the real deal,\" Cousins said. \"We hit on that draft pick. He's a great player. He's the real deal. Great hands, runs great routes. I've played with some really good skill groups in my career. Fortunate enough to do that. When I look at our group right now, it's as good as I've ever been with.\"\nVeteran receivers K.J. Osborn and Brandon Powell would also expect to see increased targets if Jefferson misses any time. O'Connell, however, said the Vikings could go in a number of different directions in that scenario.\n\"We've got some guys that are here for a reason,\" O'Connell said. \"And the beauty of having [fullback] C.J. Ham and three tight ends and multiple backs is we can reinvent ourselves in whatever way we feel is the best way to move the ball and try to score points.\""}

Indeed, they haven't been swept in a series since catcher Adley Rutschman was called up in late May of 2022.\n\"It's a pretty significant feat to go that long without it happening,\" outfielder Austin Hays said following Sunday's 11-8 loss to the Texas Rangers in Game 2 of the American League Division Series. \"I think it's a byproduct of us being able to always turn the page and move on from what happened the day before.

Rookie starter Grayson Rodriguez, who had been so good in the second half with a 2.58 ERA, struggled with his fastball command and got knocked out in a five-run second inning, issuing four walks and six hits while recording just five outs.\nMitch Garver added a third-inning grand slam to give the Rangers a 9-2 lead, and a late Baltimore rally in the ninth inning fell short.\n\"Our backs are against the wall right now, and tonight wasn't our best night on the mound,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We haven't played our two best games here. We played well on the road all year, so hopefully we can play well on the road.\"\nThe odds are against the Orioles mounting a series comeback. The Rangers are the 32nd team to win the first two games of a best-of-five series on the road; 28 of the previous 31 went on to win the series.\n\"There is no tomorrow. I feel like that's how our team played all year, honestly,\" Hays said. \"We're just going to play with our hair on fire and win three in a row.\"\nRodriguez came out firing: His first pitch was 100 mph. He escaped a bases-loaded jam in the first inning, but his inability to get ahead of hitters came back to bite him in the second inning.\n\"I was just spraying fastballs and not hitting the zone consistently, so it was just not working for me,\" Rodriguez said. \"We were trying to be aggressive and induce early contact, make them put them on the ground, that was the goal.\"\nHyde brought in reliever Bryan Baker to start the third inning. Baker had last pitched for the Orioles on Sept. 15 -- after which he was sent down to Triple-A. He made two appearances there, allowing seven runs over 1⅔ innings. He faced four batters and walked three of them. Jacob Webb, who served up a home run in Game 1 to Josh Jung, entered to face Garver, and Garver slugged a 3-1 fastball for the grand slam.\n\"In the third inning, I had a lot of game left,\" Hyde said. \"Started with Baker against the bottom of the order there, I was hoping he'd give us an inning. That didn't work out.\"\nAlso not working out: solving Seager, the Rangers' best hitter, who hit .317/.390/.623 and walked twice in Game 1 and went 4-for-8 with two walks and three doubles in the two-game wild-card sweep of the Rays. Seager walked on six pitches against Rodriguez in the first inning, walked on another full count in the second, walked on five pitches against Baker in the third, walked on five pitches against Jack Flaherty in the fifth and drew his hard-earned record-breaking fifth walk after a nine-pitch battle against Yennier Cano in the ninth inning.\nSeventeen times in postseason history a player had drawn four walks in a game -- including David Ortiz twice -- but Seager became the first with a five-walk game.\n\"He's a really good hitter, so we're trying to be careful,\" Rutschman said. \"We want to try to execute our game plan, but it probably just has to be a little more precise with him, so that probably led to more walks.\"\nSeager isn't normally known for his patience.\n\"We know he likes to swing the bat,\" Garver said. \"I think it was his fifth at-bat and he chased a 2-0 heater that was above his eyes. So I think at that point he kind of wanted to hit.\"\nAs impressive as the Rangers have looked in their four postseason games -- they're hitting .272/.376/.456 and have scored 25 runs -- those four games were all on the road. They return home for the first time after two weeks -- and they love to hit at Globe Life Field, where they hit 53 more home runs than they did on the road. It might be a tough order for the Orioles to avoid their first sweep of the season."}

Watt recovers a fumble on one drive and ends the Ravens' hopes on the next possession with a sack on fourth down (0:54)\nAfter a blowout loss in London six years ago, the Baltimore Ravens are taking a much different route to England this time.\nThe Ravens headed overseas Monday morning, which marks the earliest a team has traveled for an international game this year. The Atlanta Falcons, Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills all left on Thursday for their London games this season.\nBaltimore decided to fly out six days before its game against the Tennessee Titans because of a forgettable experience in 2017. In the Ravens' only international game in franchise history, the team flew out on Thursday night and got routed by the Jaguars 44-7. The 37-point loss is the second-largest margin of defeat in an NFL international game.\n\"It's mostly driven by the fact that we didn't do well, so we did the opposite,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said when asked about leaving early in the week. \"There's no data -- and we looked for it -- to say when you should go out there and what's the ideal thing. I'll say this kind of in jest, what's the science on that? As often is the case, they really don't know. That's just the way it is.\"\nThe Titans are flying out Thursday after practice.\nHeaded across the pond ✈️@ZIPSCleaners pic.twitter.com/cZK4ehlMFJ\nBy spending the entire week in London, the Ravens will temporarily move their entire operations across the pond.\n\"The good thing about it is I personally don't have to worry about any of that. I just expect it to be perfect,\" Harbaugh said with a smile. \"They do a great job. You got the video, you got the medical, you got the equipment, you got all those things -- you got the computer stuff. As coaches and players, all we really have to do is go out there and focus on preparing and getting ready for the game.\"\nThis is a quick turnaround for the Ravens (3-2). Baltimore left for England about 12 hours after landing back from Pittsburgh, where the Ravens fell to the Steelers 17-10 on Sunday.\nBut the Ravens are banking on being fully adjusted for Sunday's game, which kicks off at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\"Hopefully, by the time the game comes around ... We've slept there six nights. You'd like to think we'll be pretty well ready to go,\" Harbaugh said. \"I think that's probably a big part of the decision to try and do it this way. Other teams go in there and say, 'OK, we're not going to mess with it. We'll just stay on our own clock and play at 9:30 [British time] and we'll get in and out. We don't have to deal with it. It's just kind of two schools of thought.\""}
{"title": "No. 1 to watch: Chicago's Bedard 'as advertised'", "date": "2023-10-09 14:47:34", "text": "Take a look back at some of the NHL's greatest rookie debuts as we await Connor Bedard's first game with the Blackhawks. (1:33)\nChicago Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson knows he has something special in Connor Bedard, the No. 1 pick in this year's NHL draft.\n\"He's been exactly as advertised,\" Davidson told ESPN entering Tuesday's NHL season opener. \"He's everything we thought he would be on the ice in terms of skill, the hockey sense, the highlight reel moves. The only thing he hasn't done is beat a goalie yet, which I'm sure is eating him up. But it will come.\"\nThe rookie led the Blackhawks through the preseason with five points (one goal, four assists) in four games -- though the goal was an empty netter. Bedard was also poke-checked on a shootout attempt by Minnesota Wild goalie Marc-Andre Fleury after trying some slick moves.\nBedard, 18, has also turned heads with some crafty plays in practice and preseason games, which has the entire league talking about him and his ability to live up to his pre-draft hype.\nHe is expected to center the Blackhawks' top line -- flanked by veterans Taylor Hall and Ryan Donato -- on Tuesday, when Chicago opens on the road against the Pittsburgh Penguins (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) and his childhood idol, Sidney Crosby.\nCrosby immediately became the Penguins' best player in his 2005-06 rookie season, leading the team with 102 points in 81 games. Though Davidson was hesitant to make specific predictions for Bedard, he's expecting a similar transformative impact.\n\"He's going to be a big driver of our offense. He's going to be a big part of our team just walking in,\" Davidson said. \"As far as stat and goal totals, I really don't have a feel for that. But he's going to be a driver of impact for our team right away.\"\nBedard has expressed frustration after losses in the preseason, and he didn't celebrate much after his empty net goal. Davidson said he's hoping the coaching staff and veteran players will help Bedard adjust to the ebbs and flows of pro hockey.\nThe Blackhawks brought in several respected veterans including Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry to help usher Bedard's transition from junior hockey.\nBedard played last season for the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League, scoring 71 goals and 143 goals in 57 games against his peers in his age group.\n\"It's also up to us to temper expectations a little bit. This isn't junior hockey anymore; there's going to be a transition phase,\" Davidson said. \"I think he gets that. He's not walking in here expecting to put up the same amount of points or goals as junior hockey. But he also holds himself up to a high standard and you also don't want to take that intensity away from a player because that's what makes him great.\"\nThe Blackhawks are a team in transition after parting with Stanley Cup stalwarts Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews in the past year. The team has made the playoffs just once since 2017.\nWhen asked where the Blackhawks were in their rebuild, Davidson answered simply: \"We're in Year 2.\"\n\"It's hard to say where we're at,\" Davidson added. \"We got a great victory with [winning] the lottery. That definitely helped. But where we're at in terms of a stage, it's a build stage. We're still early days. We've really got only one full season under my belt. [Coach] Luke [Richardson] is in his second season. We're only starting to see some of our first draft classes break into the NHL. We've got a lot of players that are going to be a key part of this that aren't in pro hockey yet.\"\nDavidson said he is just hoping for growth, and a commitment to playing a certain style under Richardson. He also reiterated that the team is not directed to tank, and he'd be more than happy with a surprise playoff berth.\n\"You come to the rink, you better come to win,\" Davidson said. \"That's what we all expect. You need to develop a positive culture. But what we're trying to build here is something sustainable.\"\nThe Blackhawks are also welcoming another key player to their opening day lineup: Lukas Reichel, 21, their 2020 first-round pick.\n\"We gave him a pretty big summer project: show us that you want to be a centerman, and put in the work both on and off the ice,\" Davidson said. \"He's played really responsibly, especially in the defensive zone. He had a great camp.\"\nThough Reichel is waiver-exempt, Davidson said fans should expect to see him in a prominent NHL role. The German-born forward will begin opening night as the No. 2 center, slotted behind Bedard.\n\"[Reichel] is beyond the point of needing AHL time,\" Davidson said. \"He's going to be with us moving forward here.\""}

(0:55)\nUSA Basketball is aggressively pursuing Boston Celtics All-Star guard Jrue Holiday to return to Team USA for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sources told ESPN.\nHoliday, 33, has yet to decide, but USA officials -- with managing director Grant Hill leading the way -- are hopeful Holiday will commit to being one of the 12 members on next year's Team USA Olympic team, sources said.\nUSA Basketball officials use the word \"beloved\" to describe how strongly they feel about Holiday, whom they considered the second-most-impactful player, after Kevin Durant, on the 2021 gold-medal-winning team. Team USA struggled defensively in the FIBA world championships this summer in the Philippines and Holiday's on-ball defense, playmaking and leadership are among the factors fueling USA Basketball's recruitment.\nThe 2024 Olympic team is expected to include such future Hall of Famers as LeBron James, Durant, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid and Jayson Tatum, but some of the All-Stars who publicly volunteered recently that they plan to play for Team USA won't be extended invitations. There's no timetable on a Holiday decision, but Hill and coach Steve Kerr have put a premium on the combination of Holiday's talent and temperament as a necessary component to build a gold-medal roster, sources said.\nIn the more physical FIBA game, Holiday thrived on the USA's way to the 2021 gold. He had a run of shutting down opposing guards in the final three rounds of the tournament that played a huge part in the Americans' championship.\nHoliday, a five-team All-Defensive selection in the NBA, averaged 19.3 points for the Milwaukee Bucks last season. He also averaged career highs in rebounds (5.1) and free throw percentage (86%) for the Bucks, per ESPN Stats & Information. Holiday ranked in the top 5% in field goal percentage allowed as the closest defender last season among players to defend at least 700 shots, per Second Spectrum. Holiday arrived with the Celtics in a recent trade from the Portland Trail Blazers, who acquired him as part of the Damian Lillard blockbuster."}
{"title": "European review: Barca salvage draw in thriller, Arsenal edge Man City", "date": "2023-10-09 15:02:14", "text": "Bryan Zaragoza paces Granada early with a brace, but Barcelona evens the game late on goals by Lamine Yamal and Sergi Roberto. (1:42)\nAnother weekend of European football has come and gone. If you merely checked the box scores, you'd think there were few surprises as the weekend's action got underway, but those full-time figures tell only half the story.\nOn Saturday in the Premier League, Manchester United won, although you wouldn't know it if you walked out of Old Trafford in the 92nd minute, and so did Chelsea, they themselves coming from behind, too. Borussia Dortmund also overturned a deficit to seal a win whose scoreline belies the struggle last year's Bundesliga runners-up faced. Elsewhere, the world was reminded of Jude Bellingham's seemingly limitless potential as he kept Real Madrid on top of LaLiga.\nOn Sunday, Arsenal ended their losing streak against Man City with a late goal from Gabriel Martinelli, while Liverpool and Brighton shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw. In Germany, Bayern Munich won comfortably over Freiburg but sit in third place behind Stuttgart and Leverkusen. Meanwhile, Barcelona salvaged a draw against Granada after going 2-0 down, and PSG clinched a much-needed win against Rennes.\nHere is your look back at all the fun from the weekend.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nSergi Roberto's late goal rescued Barcelona a point at Granada on Sunday as they came from two down to draw 2-2 at the Nuevo Los Cármenes in a game packed with incident.\nBryan Zaragoza, the league's smallest player at 5-foot-3, opened the scoring after just 17 seconds (the quickest goal Barça have ever conceded in LaLiga). The diminutive forward then added a brilliant second, turning Jules Koundé inside out in the 29th minute to leave Xavi Hernandez's side with a mountain to climb in the shadows of the Sierra Nevada.\nThe comeback began with a piece of history when Lamine Yamal turned home from close range to become the youngest goal scorer in LaLiga at 16 years and 87 days old. Roberto then came off the bench to equalise in the 85th minute, but the drama did not end there. There was still time for Zaragoza, on a hat-trick, to smash the post and Barça to have a stoppage-time goal ruled out. João Félix, who thought he had netted the winner, was not offside, but Ferran Torres, who had attempted to play the ball before him, was.\nThe draw leaves Granada in the relegation zone and sees Barça slip to third in the table, three points behind Real Madrid and one back from Girona. That gap will not worry Xavi at this stage of the season, but problems are mounting with the first clásico of the season on the horizon at the end of October.\nInjuries are continuing to pile up. Kounde was withdrawn here in the first half. He joins Pedri, Frenkie de Jong, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski on the treatment table. However, it's Barça's defensive issues which Xavi will look to fix during the international break. They have now conceded 10 goals in LaLiga this season through nine games -- it took them 31 matches to concede that amount last season.\nThe ease with which they leak goals keeps leaving them in compromising positions. They recovered from 2-0 down to beat Celta Vigo 3-2 and twice came back to draw 2-2 at Mallorca recently. Granada can now be added to their list of comebacks, but opposition such as Athletic Bilbao and Madrid, their next two league games, may not be so forgiving. -- Sam Marsden\nArsenal ended their 12-game losing streak against Manchester City and signalled their readiness to end a 20-year Premier League title drought after Nathan Aké's late own goal sealed a deserved win for the Gunners.\nGabriel Martinelli's shot from the edge of the penalty area, following a lay-off by Kai Havertz, beat City keeper Éderson after taking a heavy deflection off Ake's head in the 86th minute to not only give Arsenal the major psychological boost of beating Pep Guardiola's team but also inflict City's second successive league defeat.\nJanusz Michallik slams Pep Guardiola's tactical decisions in Manchester City's 1-0 loss vs. Arsenal.\nHaving been forced to face City without injured talisman Bukayo Saka, Arsenal then had to overcome the first-half failure of referee Michael Oliver to send off Mateo Kovacic following a late challenge on Martin Odegaard which, despite being reviewed by VAR, did not lead to a red card for the former Chelsea player. Kovacic was then spared a second yellow card -- and dismissal -- six minutes later when Oliver failed to take action following another bad tackle on Declan Rice.\nBut despite City avoiding the loss of a key player to a red card, Arsenal put the sense of injustice behind them and held firm in a mature and confident performance. Last season, City twice beat the Gunners convincingly before going on to win the title, but Mikel Arteta's side avoided the same fate this time around and was able to make the breakthrough for a crucial win when Martinelli's shot beat Ederson thanks to Ake's deflection.\nThe victory moves Arsenal joint top with North London rivals Tottenham with the two clubs now the only unbeaten teams in the Premier League. -- Mark Ogden\nConceding the game's first goal is becoming less of a habit for this Liverpool team and more of an addiction. Simon Adingra's opening goal for Brighton was the seventh time in Liverpool's 11 matches so far this season in which they've gone behind.\nLiverpool revel in a comeback victory, though, and shortly after the celebrations from the home fans died down it became clear that all Adingra's goal had done was wake Jurgen Klopp's team out of its stupor. Mohamed Salah's two goals in the space of six minutes gave Liverpool an unlikely lead heading into the half. The intensity of the action that followed in the second half was all the more impressive when you consider that both teams, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, were in action in the Europa League on Thursday night.\nJanusz Michallik explains why he was disappointed with Liverpool in their 2-2 draw with Brighton.\nRyan Gravenberch should have put the game beyond Brighton in the 54th minute when he inexplicably rattled the crossbar from close range with the goal gaping in front of him. While Lewis Dunk's equaliser 12 minutes from time felt as if it might set up a grandstand finish on the south coast, in the end a draw was perhaps a fair result.\nAfter last week's VAR furore over Luis Díaz's disallowed goal against Tottenham, the video assistant referee, Christopher Kavanagh, would have been praying for a quiet afternoon, but he managed to draw the ire of both teams during the 90 minutes.\nFirst, he elected not to recommend a red card for Pascal Gross as well as a penalty for hauling down Dominik Szoboszlai as last man. Second, he did not consider Virgil Van Dijk's second-half handball worthy of a penalty for De Zerbi's team -- a decision that caused the Brighton fans to reference Klopp's midweek comments in the chant, \"We want a replay.\" -- Tom Chambers\nGames between Bayern Munich and SC Freiburg are proof that history can indeed repeat itself. Since 1993, Bayern have never lost to Freiburg at home. The 3-0 win on Sunday was their 22nd home victory over Freiburg out of 25 games and simply another example of how helpless Freiburg usually are when they travel to the Bavarian capital.\nLeroy Sané put on a star performance, as the 27-year-old not only scored the second goal but also was omnipresent in the final third. Boss Thomas Tuchel decided to use Harry Kane in a familiar role, with the England captain frequently dropping back into the midfield and exploring opportunities to find Sané behind Freiburg's back line. A similar tactical setup worked beautifully against Manchester United in the Champions League a few weeks ago and also did the trick on Sunday.\nKingsley Coman scores two, and Leroy Sane provides another as Bayern Munich get the 3-0 win over SC Freiburg.\nGranted, Bayern benefited from what appeared to be a fluke goal by Kingsley Coman in the 12th minute, with the French winger seemingly attempting a high cross that ended up hitting the inside of the back post. The goal broke the deadlock for Bayern and gave the critics of Noah Atubolu, Freiburg's starting goalkeeper this season, new fodder.\nWhile they conceded the first goal in unlucky fashion, Freiburg did not look like a side playing to win. In the absence of Matthias Ginter, who is undoubtedly their outstanding defender, and amid a lack of urgency in pressing, Freiburg were overwhelmed by Bayern's dominance in ball possession. Whether it was Kane chipping the ball to Sané, Thomas Müller making one of his trademark runs inside the penalty area or Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies running at defenders at full speed, Bayern found enough ways to outplay their opponents.\nIf there is anything Tuchel has to worry about currently, it is his diminished group of defenders. With Matthijs de Ligt being out due to an injury, Dayot Upamecano and Kim Min-Jae are the only two remaining high-level centre-backs in Bayern's squad. Attrition did not hurt Bayern on Sunday, though at some point it very well could. -- Constantin Eckner\nAfter some tough and tense days following the disappointing goalless draw last weekend at Clermont and more importantly the heavy defeat in Newcastle in the Champions League on Wednesday night (4-1), Paris were under pressure for their trip to Rennes on Sunday night. Another loss and the crisis would be big. They needed to win and ideally with style. That's exactly what they did.\nEven if Rennes created the first chances, the Ligue 1 champions were efficient, solid, convincing, thrilling in their passing and brave too. Despite the hosts' intensity and pressing, the Parisians won comprehensively. And maybe the biggest lesson for this victory is who led the team to it. It wasn't Kylian Mbappé. It wasn't Ousmane Dembélé on his return to his old club. It was Vitinha, the same Vitinha who was dropped to the bench by manager Luis Enrique for the trip to Newcastle.\nPSG are now third in the table, one point behind Nice and two behind the league leaders Monaco after eight league games. With this win, they also bought themselves a bit of peace and quiet for the next few days. -- Julien Laurens\nAC Milan plan to sell Olivier Giroud goalkeeper jerseys after the striker's heroics in goal in their 1-0 win against Genoa. Giroud was forced to go in goal after Mike Maignan was sent off and Milan had no more substitutions. Milan said in a statement: \"The Club has decided to honour his performance in its last line of defence by putting him in the list of goalkeepers. Additionally, fans can now purchase the goalkeeper jersey and customize it with 'Giroud 9.'\"\nWayne Rooney has resigned as D.C. United head coach after the team was eliminated from MLS playoff contention. D.C. lost 2-0 to NYCFC at home in its final game of the regular season, with the team announcing immediately after the game that it had parted ways with Rooney, who previously spent 18 months as a player with D.C. and rejoined the club as head coach in July 2022.\nArsenal's Bukayo Saka will miss England duty to recover from injury. The 22-year-old suffered a hamstring strain in the Gunners' Champions League defeat to Lens and was unavailable for their win against Man City on Sunday. Mikel Arteta said: \"No, he cannot make it. He hasn't had a single training session so he will be out. He's not available to play football at the moment.\"\nBarcelona's Lamine Yamal became the youngest goal scorer in LaLiga history after finding the net against Granada. At 16 years and 87 days old, Yamal beat the previous record by less than two weeks. The Spain international has broke through this season under Xavi Hernandez, and all eyes are on the young winger to continue to make history.\n16-year-old Lamine Yamal tallies an easy goal and becomes the youngest scorer in LaLiga history.\nMissed the action on Saturday? Keep reading for all the talking points.\nIt's 10 out of 10 for Jude Bellingham: 10 goals in 10 Real Madrid games, the latest coming in a brace in Saturday's 4-0 win over Osasuna. Bellingham has been playing as a No. 10, too, even if he wears the No. 5.\nHis goal scoring just won't stop and neither will the comparisons. First it was Zinedine Zidane. Then it was Alfredo di Stefano. You hear choruses of \"Hey Jude\" every week at the Santiago Bernabeu. There are Bellingham shirts everywhere you look. Children imitate his arms-out-wide goal celebration. The fans couldn't love him more.\nBellingham's first goal against Osasuna came in the ninth minute after nice work from Luka Modric -- back in the team and proving his worth, with more touches and completed passes than any other player -- and then Eduardo Camavinga and Dani Carvajal. His second, to end the contest in the 54th minute, was the product of a one-two with Federico Valverde, before finishing through the legs of goalkeeper Sergio Herrera. His role in Madrid's third was limited to picking up Valverde, who had created the goal with a clever through ball for Vinicius Junior, to carry the Uruguayan player into the middle of the celebrations, ensuring that he got his share of the credit.\nAfter forward Joselu made it 4-0, Bellingham was quickly substituted. The stadium stood to applaud. They know they're witnessing something very special: a star is born. -- Alex Kirkland\nChelsea's trip to Burnley started similarly to so many of their games this Premier League season. The visitors looked bright in fits and starts, but that promise counted for little after just 15 minutes when Lyle Foster ran around both Axel Disasi and Thiago Silva to set up Wilson Odobert, whose stutter step befuddled Marc Cucurella and finish eluded Robert Sánchez.\nConsidering the growing pains the Blues have endured this season, it would've been easy for heads to drop. This was a starting XI whose average age was 24.6 and who'd averaged just 32 appearances for Chelsea. If you remove the 39-year-old Thiago Silva from the equation, the average age drops to 23.2 and the average appearances for the west London club falls to a mere 22.8.\nThis is an inexperienced team short on leadership. On this day, though, there was one player experienced enough to refuse to accept defeat.\nNo one on the pitch bettered Raheem Sterling's nine progressive carries (which advance the ball greater than five metres toward goal in the opposition half), only Enzo Fernández completed more passes in the attacking third than his 14, and no one registered more shots (three) or shots on target (two) than the 28-year-old England international. He was instrumental in every single one of Chelsea's goals as they beat Burnley 4-1.\nHis 42nd-minute cross was deflected into the hosts' goal to level the score, he won the penalty for Cole Palmer to give the Blues the lead from the spot, his 65th-minute strike gave his side some breathing room and his pacy run down the left flank ultimately resulted in Nicolas Jackson scoring the final goal of the match. These were just rewards for a player who should be the role model for a team full of immensely talented 20-somethings whose potentials are yet to be fulfilled.\nSteve Nicol credits Raheem Sterling's performance in Chelsea's win over Burnley to being dropped by England boss Gareth Southgate.\nFrom his breakout at Liverpool to his big-money move to Manchester City, Sterling has felt the pressure that weighs on the shoulders of young players on big wages with even bigger expectations. Chelsea will need to rely on his experience and his leadership if they're to regain their status among English football's elite. -- Austin Lindberg\nIt's far from a rarity; seeing black armbands wrapped around the biceps of the two teams on the pitch, a moment's silence before kickoff something of a growing routine across football. Often, it's for a former player from the men's side, someone from generations past who had had a good innings, left to be survived by children and grandchildren.\nNot so often are we asked to pause and celebrate a shorter life of a player who had been active until their passing.\nEven with the context of the rapid recent growth of the women's game following the past two World Cups that have driven record attendances, increased participation and vast investment, many corners of women's football still feel small and familial.\nNo, Maddy Cusack wasn't a household name in women's football, most of her career spent in the second tier of the English game, but she had shared pitches with many of the players across the top two divisions. Fans of other teams up and down the country had likely spent an afternoon or evening unwittingly watching the midfielder play as they took in their 90 minutes of live entertainment over a weekend. She had been part of the landscape of the game, a piece of the expansive puzzle, that had mixed and blurred with the others but became all too easy to spot once lost.\nBefore the opening game of the Women's Super League season, two of her former managers stood on the touchline, former teammates on the pitch at one of her former clubs. Even with the increased attendance, there were still those Villa ultras who had been there back when the Midlands club was in WSL 2 (as the Championship was known at the time), drawing home crowds of between 200 and 400 fans. Those were the fans who could remember Cusack's teen years spent in claret and blue after her move from Nottingham Forest.\nFrom Villa to crosstown rivals Birmingham City to Leicester City and on to Sheffield United, where the midfielder spent the last four years of her life, moving around the growing women's football bubble. But it was still just that, a bubble, one that had unexpectedly been put into mourning last month by the news of Cusack's death, and so the minutes of silence and applause began, to honour the life of the 27-year-old.\nWith the men's team at Sheffield United having paid their tributes to the midfielder, who paired her playing with a job as a marketing exec at the Blades' foundation, it was time for Cusack's team to say one last goodbye at Bramall Lane. Their fixture against London City Lionesses was brought forward a day so that some of her former teammates could attend the Championship clash and pay their respects to the friend they had lost.\nFrom the tribute video before kickoff to the two rounds of applause -- before the match and during the eighth minute, for the number she wore on the back of her shirt -- there was an unmistakable sombre hue over the game. Those on the pitch shifting focus to the task at hand as so many players around the world do once the whistle has sounded, football the familiar escapism. The result -- a much-needed 3-1 win -- was the story for the football pages but left as a footnote as the club continued its grieving process. -- Lawson\nManager Erik ten Hag said after Manchester United's dramatic 2-1 come-from-behind win over Brentford that he sent on Scott McTominay as a late substitute and said \"score two goals.\" Those instructions worked like a charm.\nSteve Nicol isn't convinced by Manchester United's late comeback win over Brentford in the Premier League.\nMcTominay has had to be patient at Old Trafford this season, starting just two games in all competitions, but this was a timely reminder of what he can contribute to a team clearly struggling. The Scotland international is one of the top scorers in Euro 2024 qualifying, was wanted by Bayern Munich in the summer and is surely deserving of an opportunity in a stuttering United team.\nCasemiro was one of those at fault for Brentford's goal and was substituted at half-time. Summer signing Sofyan Amrabat looks like he's still trying to get to grips with the pace of the Premier League and Mason Mount has so far done little to justify his £60 million transfer fee from Chelsea.\nMcTominay might not be a Ten Hag favourite, but his favourites aren't working and, injury permitting, the 26-year-old should be in the team when United resume after the international break with a trip to Sheffield United. Except perhaps 20-year-old striker Rasmus Højlund, no one in the squad can say they are playing well enough to justify automatic selection and McTominay's late heroics against Brentford should be enough to guarantee at least a chance. -- Rob Dawson\nIn what was just their second match of the season, Arsenal were already facing the prospect of a must-win against Manchester United after their opening-day defeat at home to Liverpool. Indeed, a loss would have been their fourth straight, spanning back to last season, marking a new club record. The prospect was a tricky one, though, facing a team they had failed to beat in their past five meetings across both league and cup.\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Melvine Malard's deft strike -- again, something of a gift from the Gunners' regrettable defending -- looked to have won it for the hosts, but just as stoppage time gave(th) to United last week, it took(eth) away on Friday night as Cloe Lacasse fired a rocket into the narrow gap between the apex of the woodwork and Mary Earps's outstretched paw. The scoreline read 2-2 when the full-time whistle went.\nIt had been a game of errors from both sides, as well as flashes of quality from top to bottom, with the new attacking additions continuing to ink their names into the memory.

{"title": "Why Arsenal, Man United are struggling with new goalkeepers Raya, Onana", "date": "2023-10-09 15:02:14", "text": "Mark Ogden explains the difficulty for Arsenal's defenders in moving from Aaron Ramsdale to David Raya in goal. (1:32)\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta felt compelled to defend goalkeeper David Raya after the Gunners ended their 12-game losing streak against Manchester City to defeat the Premier League champions 1-0 on Sunday. \"I think he was excellent,\" Arteta said. \"The way he controlled the ball, how dominant he was and how high he played. I love players with courage.\"\nArteta has made a big call over the Brentford loanee this season, choosing to replace previous No. 1 Aaron Ramsdale -- a significant figure in Arsenal's title challenge last term -- in favour of a different kind of player. Raya is the ultimate modern goalkeeper: comfortable with the ball at his feet and capable of adding a new attacking dimension to the team.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag is attempting to make a similar transition, with André Onana arriving from Inter Milan to replace David de Gea this summer. But while ball-playing goalkeepers have been transformative at Manchester City and Liverpool in the Premier League -- Éderson and Alisson Becker have been crucial to their clubs' respective successes -- switching from a traditional 'keeper to a more-rounded footballer in goal is not a quick fix. Both Raya and Onana have found themselves in the eye of a storm at their new clubs already.\nIn the game against City, former Manchester United defender Gary Neville described Raya as a \"nervous wreck\" during his commentary of the game for Sky Sports. Meanwhile, the Arsenal supporters inside the stadium made their agitation clear whenever the 'keeper had the ball at his feet by raising the volume level with shouts of \"Get rid of it,\" \"What are you doing?\" and several expletive-laden expressions of alarm.\nHaving almost conceded a first-half goal when his clearance was blocked by an onrushing Julián Álvarez inside the six-yard box, Raya set the tone for a difficult afternoon in which his presence in the Arsenal goal, ahead of fans' favourite Ramsdale, was once again a major talking point.\nWith 19 goals in 10 games conceded so far, Onana's start to life at United is prompting similar levels of scrutiny. Not only because the Cameroon international has made a number of high-profile mistakes leading to goals, but also because he has taken the place of De Gea who, despite an error-ridden final season at Old Trafford last year, continues to be regarded with affection by many United supporters following his departure at the end of his contract in June.\nRaya and Onana are both highly rated goalkeepers. Raya has been one of the most consistent in the Premier League over the past two seasons for Brentford; Onana enjoyed success at Ajax and Inter before being identified as De Gea's replacement by Ten Hag.\nCrucially, Raya and Onana have the absolute backing of their managers, with both Arteta and Ten Hag wanting a goalkeeper who can give their team greater control of the ball. In turn, that means they can set up to defend higher up the pitch and look to the goalkeeper to beat an opponent's attacking press with pinpoint distribution from long and short passes.\nThat is the ideal scenario, which has been delivered by both Ederson and Alisson for their clubs, but even those two have had their meltdowns, when they have been overconfident on the ball or too keen to race out of the penalty area to try to snuff out an attack.\nWhen Pep Guardiola took charge at City in the summer of 2016, his first decision was to replace title-winning goalkeeper Joe Hart, who was England's No. 1 at the time, with Barcelona's Claudio Bravo. Guardiola wanted to oversee the same transition that Arteta and Ten Hag are attempting now, but City weren't ready for the change. Bravo often exposed the deficiencies in defence by playing his teammates into trouble with risky passes in dangerous areas or sparking confusion with his positioning in the defensive third.\nNow, City's defenders are totally comfortable when Ederson does anything similar because Guardiola has assembled a squad of players who can play with a ball-playing goalkeeper. And they have had over seven years of practice with someone like that behind them.\nRaya only arrived at the Emirates in mid-August and did not make his debut until mid-September, so the opportunity for the keeper and his defenders to familiarise themselves with each other has been minimal. And it shows. Arsenal do have defenders who are good enough on the ball to adjust to having Raya behind them, rather than Ramsdale, but it will take time.\nOnana has a different problem at United in that the majority of his defenders aren't comfortable on the ball. When Onana passes to the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot or Victor Lindelöf, he is giving the ball to players who don't want to receive it in the defensive third of the pitch. Having had De Gea in goal for the past decade, United's players have grown accustomed to a keeper who rarely left his penalty area, so Onana's confidence in rushing out it is another issue they have to take into consideration.\nThe secret to success with a ball-playing goalkeeper is having defenders who are supremely confident and comfortable on the ball. Arsenal have the players to make it work; United arguably don't. But the reality for both teams, and any other club that wants to try it, is that it takes effort from more than just the goalkeeper for it to reap rewards."}

(1:44)\nDALLAS -- Let's set the scene for Oklahoma: The Sooners and their second-year coach are in need of a signature win, with the rival Longhorns providing a golden opportunity. A smooth, lefty quarterback delivers the victory that springboards him into the Heisman Trophy race and the team into the national title discussion.\nThe year is 2000, coach Bob Stoops and QB Josh Heupel have dismantled Texas 63-14 and end up winning it all that season.\nOn Saturday, the Sooners didn't blow Texas out of the water in their 34-30 win. But a year after suffering the biggest loss to the Longhorns in school history, a 49-0 humiliation, this year's lefty signal-caller, Dillon Gabriel, landed a devastating knockout blow with a five-play, 62-second game-winning touchdown drive that delivered a statement of its own: The Sooners have their swagger back, and it feels an awful lot like it did 23 years ago.\nEchoes of 2000? Don't take our word for it. Listen to someone who was there.\n\"It reminds me a little bit of that, 1999 to 2000,\" Oklahoma coach Brent Venables said Saturday afternoon. \"No offense to these guys, but we had a bunch of misfits back in 2000. We didn't know how good we could be.\"\nVenables was a second-year Oklahoma assistant in 2000. He had arrived with Bob Stoops a year before, taking over a humbled Oklahoma program that had gone 5-6 the year before under John Blake, the last season of Blake's 12-22 three-year tenure.\nVenables was also a first-year head coach in 2022, who went 6-7, the Sooners' first losing season since Blake's last. He took over after the shocking departure of Lincoln Riley for USC and the transfer of several key players, including Caleb Williams, who won the Heisman Trophy last season, and Spencer Rattler, another former starting QB. Then Texas happened. Fairly or not, it's the kind of loss that starts raising questions about whether the Sooners had landed the right coach.\nVenables just coached in his 15th Red River Rivalry. He knows the rules at Oklahoma. Start 0-2 against the Longhorns and those questions start getting louder. That hasn't happened since Gary Gibbs lost his first two in 1989 and 1990.\nThe 2022 Sooners lost at home to Kansas State and Baylor. They were blown out by TCU on the road early in the year and lost four games, including the Cheez-It Bowl against Florida State, by a field goal. They ranked 122nd out of 131 nationally in total defense. But most importantly, they were humiliated at the Cotton Bowl.\n\"My hands are all over that, and the players that played for us last year, they were hurt from that too,\" Venables said. \"Ultimately, my job as a leader is to get the best out of them, and I did a very poor job of that.\"\nThese Sooners started the season at No. 20 with a lot of questions. Venables said before the season that 76% of his roster would be first- and second-year players. The defensive line alone added six transfers. The Sooners signed seven ESPN 300 defensive recruits, their most since the rankings began in 2006. The defensive line came up big in a dramatic goal-line stand, stuffing Texas four times at the 1. Peyton Bowen, one of the gems of that recruiting class, forced a fumble on a big hit on Quinn Ewers in the third quarter.\nThe Sooners are now 6-0 and look more like the Oklahoma that won six straight Big 12 championships before that run ended last season. Baker Mayfield was on the sideline Saturday throwing the horns down on the stadium video screen, and the Sooners took Texas' best shot and conjured another helping of Sooner Magic. There's a swagger back to these Sooners.\n\"That [2000 team] was a group, they were tough as all get-out and they'd raggedy up and they just came every day and went to work. And these guys have been exactly that. We're a little shinier in some spots,\" Venables said, glancing to his right to star linebacker Danny Stutsman. \"But also, I think the parallels are that you didn't know how good we can be.\"\nThere's a belief now in Norman. That's the hard part in any coaching change. Like in 2000, Venables has returned the Sooners to the top 10 and they will now be back in the national conversation. Amid a struggling Big 12 field, it looks as if the Sooners and Longhorns are on another collision course for December in a conference title rematch.\nAt midfield Saturday after the game, Venables put on the golden hat and handed it off to his players, with a sense of gratitude.\nWhat a difference one game makes.\n\"There's no limits on what this team can do, and no excuses either,\" Venables said. \"We've got everything that we need.\""}

(0:27)\nWeek 5 of the NFL season got started Thursday night with a Chicago Bears breakout, as Justin Fields threw four touchdown passes and the Bears got their first win, beating the Washington Commanders.\nOn Sunday, the Jacksonville Jaguars' defense slowed the high-flying Buffalo Bills offense enough to win in London. Back in the United States, the Detroit Lions rolled to 4-1, the New Orleans Saints shut out the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense shined brightly in the fourth quarter against the Baltimore Ravens.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals' offense found its rhythm against the Arizona Cardinals, and the Philadelphia Eagles remained undefeated after beating the Los Angeles Rams.\nOn Sunday night, the San Francisco 49ers routed the Dallas Cowboys, as Brock Purdy and George Kittle connected for a trio of touchdowns.\nOur NFL Nation reporters reacted to all the action, answering lingering questions coming out of each game and picking out who -- or what -- is rising and falling for every team. Let's get to it.\nJump to a matchup:\nCHI-WSH | JAX-BUF | HOU-ATL | CAR-DET\nTEN-IND | NYG-MIA | NO-NE | BAL-PIT\nPHI-LAR | CIN-ARI | NYJ-DEN | KC-MIN | DAL-SF\nWhen will the 49ers lose a game? It's too early to start talking undefeated season, but the Niners' demolition of Dallas was a resounding warning that it's going to take a special effort to beat them. With quarterback Brock Purdy at the controls of an offense loaded with talent and a stingy defense that had its best performance of the season, the Niners have won 15 straight regular-season games (tied for the franchise record). There is no obvious potential loss on this schedule until late November, if at all.\nStock up after the win: LB Fred Warner. It's hard to improve on being the best player at your position in the league, but it's worth tipping the cap to Warner for his virtuoso performance Sunday night when he became the first Niner since NaVorro Bowman in 2013 to post a sack, an interception and a forced fumble in the same game.\nStock down after the win: LG Aaron Banks' biceps. It's really nitpicking to find much wrong with this performance, but Banks suffered a biceps injury that kept him out the entire second half. -- Nick Wagoner\nNext game: at Browns (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nHow big is the gap between the Cowboys and 49ers now? The Niners did whatever they wanted against a Dallas defense that was allowing 10.3 points per game. The Cowboys' offense looked worse than it looked in the 19-12 January playoff loss to San Francisco. The good news? The Cowboys won't see the 49ers again until the playoffs -- if they make it. They get two cracks at the similarly undefeated Philadelphia Eagles, but there appears to be a gap between the top two teams in the NFC and everybody else, especially after the embarrassment that was Sunday.\nStock up after the loss: The weather was certainly nice for a football game. Cooler temperatures. A little breeze. Grass field. Oh, you wanted a player? Maybe Johnathan Hankins. The defensive tackle had two pass deflections in the first half. Maybe.\nStock down after the loss: QB Dak Prescott. He had two interceptions in the playoff loss and three more Sunday -- the third three-interception game of his career. In 11 possessions with Prescott, the Cowboys managed one touchdown, one field goal, three interceptions and nine drives that were three plays or fewer. -- Todd Archer\nNext game: at Chargers (Monday, Oct. 16, 8:15 p.m. ET)\nHas Travis Kelce's value to the Chiefs ever been more evident? No. Kelce has had some big games and huge moments. But he practically willed the Chiefs to a touchdown in the third quarter after returning to the game following an ankle injury. His leaping 14-yard grab on third down allowed the Chiefs to continue the drive early. He caught two more passes on the drive, including the touchdown that put them ahead 27-13.\nStock up after the win: WR Rashee Rice. Rice caught two passes on the opening drive of the third quarter, one for a touchdown, while Kelce was out of the game with the injury. Rice, a rookie, has dropped too many passes this season, but if he can lose that habit, he'll become a bigger factor in the Chiefs' passing game.\nStock down after the win: Defensive and special teams. The Chiefs committed four penalties for 36 yards on one Vikings drive in the first half, giving their opponents a field goal. The Vikings also got a 15-yard boost on another first-half drive when rookie Nic Jones interfered with a punt catch. That led to Minnesota's only TD of the half. -- Adam Teicher\nNext game: vs. Broncos (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET)\nIs it time for the Vikings to start planning for 2024? At 1-4, let's just say the odds are against them making the playoffs. Since 1990, 161 teams have started 1-4. Of those, 150 missed the postseason. That's a 7% hit rate, which suggests that the Vikings' \"competitive rebuild\" might get accelerated in the coming weeks, despite all four losses being by one score. In the short term, the Vikings might have to push forward without receiver Justin Jefferson, who didn't return after suffering a right hamstring injury.\nStock up after the loss: WR Jordan Addison. The rookie caught a career-high six passes for 64 yards on nine targets, including a 5-yard touchdown in the second quarter and a key fourth-down conversion in the fourth quarter.\nStock down after the loss: First-possession offense. The Vikings committed a turnover on their first possession against the Chiefs. It was the third consecutive game in which they've done so. On Sunday, it was a fumble by TE Josh Oliver that ultimately became a key play considering the Chiefs won the game by one score. -- Kevin Seifert\nNext game: at Bears (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nTravis Etienne Jr. finishes with more than 100 rushing yards and two touchdowns in the Jaguars' win over the Bills.\nShould offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett buy Breece Hall a steak dinner? Absolutely. Come to think of it, everyone on the Jets should treat Breece Hall to whatever he wants. With the Jets sputtering in an ugly game, Hall lifted the entire team with a career performance -- 22 rushes for 177 yards, including a 72-yard touchdown that changed the game. Playing on the same field where he suffered a season-ending knee injury in 2022, Hall replaced that horrible memory with a highlight film and helped Hackett have the last laugh after coach Sean Payton maligned him before the season.\nStock up after the win: LB Quincy Williams. He made the defensive play of the day, with a strip-sack that resulted in a scoop and score for CB Bryce Hall with 29 seconds left. Williams, who had two sacks, is having a career year.\nStock down after the win: QB Zach Wilson. He threw a late interception and mismanaged the clock at the end of the first half, costing his team a short field goal try. This was a step back after last week's career day, although he had a late turnover that day, as well. -- Rich Cimini\nNext game: vs. Eagles (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nWhy is there reason to worry about Denver's run defense? The Jets' scoop-and-score fumble return in the closing seconds sealed the win, but the Broncos' run defense set that messy table long before. After holding the Raiders to 61 yards rushing in the season opener, Denver's rush defense has given up 122, 350, 171 and 234 yards. Upcoming opponents such as the Chiefs, Packers and Bills will force the Broncos to defend the run out of their nickel package, and that has been a significant trouble spot.\nStock up after the loss: RB Jaleel McLaughlin. He had 63 yards of offense and a touchdown the first four times he touched the ball. The Broncos moved away from him, or seemingly put him in a more traditional between-the-tackles look as the game progressed, which doesn't play to his strengths, but he continues to flash the kind of quick-strike capability the team has not been able to produce often enough.\nStock down after the loss: WR Marvin Mims Jr. An early bobble on a first-quarter punt seemed to derail him for the afternoon. He finished with one catch and was part of a bad exchange with RB Samaje Perine that resulted in another turnover. -- Jeff Legwold\nNext game: at Chiefs (Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET)\nIs Joe Burrow back? Yes. Absolutely. Not only did Burrow have his best passing game since he suffered his calf injury, completing 36 of 46 passes for 317 yards and three touchdowns, but the mobility he lacked through the first four games was very present against the Cardinals. Burrow had back-to-back scrambles for gains, something that was sorely lacking in the first four games. But his movement was on full display on an 11-yard touchdown pass to WR Ja'Marr Chase in the fourth quarter. He held the ball for 4.8 seconds, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, buying time until Chase streaked open.\nStock up after the win: Chase. He had three touchdowns Sunday after coming into the week with zero and set the Bengals' record for most catches in franchise history, finishing the game with 15 receptions for 192 yards.\nStock down after the win: Run defense. Cincinnati was gashed for big plays on the ground, which has become a common theme this season and is a major issue. WR Rondale Moore had a 41-yard run for the Cardinals and RB James Conner had a 35-yard rush. -- Ben Baby\nNext game: vs. Seahawks (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWhat will it take for the Cardinals to move from being competitive to getting wins? The Cardinals have competed hard, if nothing else, this season, staying in games until late. On Sunday, as was the case last week in San Francisco, they got down early, mounted a comeback but couldn't position themselves for a win. Arizona has evolved since its Week 2 meltdown against the Giants. But getting off to a faster start Sunday would have prevented the Cardinals from going down 10-0 in the first quarter and then having to play catch-up. It came down to small mistakes -- a missed PAT, a pick-six in the shadows of their own goal posts, passes that sailed. Fix those and the Cardinals might be able to turn close games into wins.\nStock up after the loss: Run game. The Cardinals had 142 of their 294 total yards on the ground, highlighted by Moore's 41-yard run and rookie RB Emari Demercado finishing with 45 yards and a touchdown in place of an injured Conner.\nStock down after the loss: Depth chart. Arizona took a hit with two major injuries, one to Conner, who suffered a knee injury and didn't return, and another to safety Jalen Thompson, who suffered a hamstring injury and also was lost for the day. -- Josh Weinfuss\nNext game: at Rams (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nTravis Kelce hauls in the pass from Patrick Mahomes and crosses the goal line for a touchdown.\nHas Jalen Hurts regained his MVP form? It looks that way. Hurts amassed nearly 400 yards of offense and set a season high in rushing yards. He became just the fourth player in NFL history with 50 pass touchdowns and 25 rush TDs in his first 50 NFL games, joining Daunte Culpepper, Cam Newton and Josh Allen. Hurts played well through the first four weeks, but with his running game taking off against Los Angeles, he went to another level, reminiscent of his 2022 campaign.\nStock up after the win: TE Dallas Goedert. He entered Week 5 with just 88 receiving yards but erupted for eight catches for 117 yards and caught his first touchdown of the season. One imperfection for the Eagles over the first quarter of the season has been red zone efficiency -- they came in ranked 24th at 46%. Feeding Goedert inside the 20-yard line could help that cause, as it did Sunday.\nStock down after the win: Pass defense. Philly entered the game ranked 30th in passing touchdowns allowed (9) and yielded two more against the Rams. Slot corner remains an issue. The Eagles tried three different players at nickel Sunday -- Mario Goodrich, Eli Ricks and the newly acquired Bradley Roby -- and struggled to contain Cooper Kupp & Co. -- Tim McManus\nNext game: at Jets (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nDid the return of Kupp deliver as the Rams expected? The Rams offense struggled against a now-5-0 Eagles team, but Kupp's return showed the potential for an offense led by him and rookie WR Puka Nacua. QB Matthew Stafford went to Kupp early and often; his 95 yards in the first half were his most in a first half in his last 19 games played, according to ESPN Stats & Information. Kupp finished with 118 yards on eight catches. But Sean McVay and Stafford still involved Nacua, who had seven catches for 71 yards.\nStock up after the loss: CB Ahkello Witherspoon. The veteran had a takeaway for the third straight game. His pick Sunday was just the third time Eagles QB Jalen Hurts has been intercepted when targeting WR A.J. Brown since the start of last season (including the playoffs).\nStock down after the loss: Third-down defense. The Rams struggled to get off the field against the Eagles on third down, specifically hampered by an inability to wrap up Hurts, who ran for 72 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. The Eagles were 13-for-18 on third down. -- Sarah Barshop\nNext game: vs. Cardinals (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nHave the Lions upgraded at running back with David Montgomery as RB1? With Jahmyr Gibbs out with a hamstring injury, Montgomery continued to carry the load with 109 yards on 19 carries. His rushing touchdown on Sunday gives him six in his first four games. Former Lions RB Jamaal Williams set the franchise mark with 17 rushing touchdowns last season, with most coming on the goal line, but Montgomery has displayed an ability to do more. He scored a 42-yard touchdown in the first quarter, which was the second longest of his career.\nStock up after the win: TE Sam LaPorta. The rookie is proving to be a steal by GM Brad Holmes, scoring two touchdowns Sunday. His early connection with quarterback Jared Goff has made him an instant contributor for the offense. LaPorta's 25 receptions in his first five games are the third most for a tight end since 1950, joining Keith Jackson (29 in 1988) and Jordan Reed (26 in 2013).\nStock down after the win: Third-down offense. There wasn't much to nitpick after a complete win on both sides of the ball. But the offense was just 4-for-9 on third downs against the Panthers. After five games, the Lions' 39.4% conversion rate ranks 16th in the NFL; it's one of the rare categories in which the Lions' offense isn't among the league's best. -- Eric Woodyard\nNext game: at Buccaneers (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET)\nShould the Panthers sit Bryce Young in favor of Andy Dalton? Young's turnovers are hurting the Panthers, who've given up 45 points off turnovers this season. Of those, 31 came directly after a Young fumble or interception, including 14 in the first half against the Lions. The most efficient the offense has been was in Week 3 vs. Seattle, when veteran backup Dalton started in place of an injured Young. The Seahawks had zero points off turnovers. Young is the long-term answer, but Dalton may be the short-term solution for this 0-5 team as it looks for an identity.\nStock up after the loss: Laviska Shenault Jr. The Panthers have been trying to decide whether he's best at wide receiver or running back. They seemed to tip their hand Sunday, giving the 2020 second-round pick (by the Jaguars) five rushes for 27 yards.\nStock down after the loss: RB Miles Sanders. He got a four-year, $25.4 million deal to be Carolina's lead back and take the pressure off Bryce Young as a runner and receiver. He came into Sunday's game averaging 2.9 yards per carry, and against the Lions he had only 32 yards rushing and a fumble that led to a Lions touchdown. -- David Newton\nNext game: at Dolphins (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nIs Kyle Pitts' season breakout what jolted Ridder's best day as a pro? After a week full of questions about job security, quarterback Desmond Ridder responded with his best game as a pro, completing 28 of 37 passes for 329 yards and a touchdown while rushing once for a 7-yard touchdown and completing his second fourth-quarter comeback this season. It's his first game over 250 yards passing as a pro. A lot of it had to do with the reemergence of the tight end, who had his most receptions (seven for 87 yards) since his rookie year in 2021. This Ridder-Pitts connection is what Atlanta had been looking for.\nStock up after the win: DC Ryan Nielsen. Atlanta's defense has consistently done enough to win, allowing one touchdown per game over the past two weeks and kept the Falcons in games while the offense has had to sort out its issues.\nStock down after the win: RB Cordarrelle Patterson. It's likely the Falcons will say Patterson is still working his way back into the lineup, but he's been an offensive nonfactor his first two weeks, with a handful of combined snaps and one catch for 7 yards. -- Michael Rothstein\nNext game: vs. Commanders (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWill the Texans' scoring woes become a trend? Even though quarterback C.J. Stroud threw the go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Dalton Schultz, the passing attack was inconsistent. The Texans' passing offense was humming over the past three weeks -- ranking fourth in passing yards per game (281) coming into the matchup. But Stroud went 20 of 35 for 249 yards with a touchdown, and the offense scored only 19 points -- with four drives ending in field goals.\nStock up after the loss: Schultz. The tight end had his best game as a Texan with seven catches for 65 yards, a season high, with a touchdown.\nStock down after the loss: Pass defense. Coming into the matchup, the Falcons' passing offense averaged an NFL-worst 156 yards per game, and it was able to throw for 351 yards Sunday. -- DJ Bien-Aime\nNext game: vs. Saints (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nHas the emergence of De'Von Achane turned the Dolphins into a run-first offense? The rookie did it again, turning in his third straight 100-yard rushing performance, highlighted by a 76-yard sprint to the end zone -- his fifth touchdown of the season. Achane finished with 151 yards on 11 carries, paving the way for a 222-yard day for the Dolphins on the ground. Raheem Mostert was no slouch, either, with 65 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries. Miami still tore up the Giants' defense through the air to the tune of 302 yards, but if Achane and Mostert are going to continue to run the ball this effectively, Miami has to ride that until the wheels fall off.\nStock up after the win: Big-play offense. We knew they were fast entering the season, but the Dolphins are now responsible for the seven fastest ball-carrier speeds in the NFL this season, including a new top overall speed courtesy of Tyreek Hill (22.01 mph).\nStock down after the win: QB Tua Tagovailoa. It wasn't his sharpest day, throwing a pair of interceptions. While 233 of his 302 passing yards came after the catch, it says a lot that a 300-yard, two-touchdown game is now considered a \"down\" performance for the fourth-year quarterback. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nNext game: vs. Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWhen is this offense going to show some competency? Sunday night in Buffalo isn't an ideal spot for a 1-4 team, even if there is a chance that running back Saquon Barkley (ankle) and left tackle Andrew Thomas (hamstring) return. Now the Giants also have to deal with the uncertainty of quarterback Daniel Jones (neck). It might be at least another couple of weeks before the Giants can get their offensive line to be functional. Giants quarterbacks were sacked seven times on Sunday, and the offense did not score a touchdown for the second straight game.\nStock up after the loss: The defense. The Giants' defense was their best offense Sunday. They gave up some big plays and 31 points to an explosive Miami offense, but they also had three turnovers, including Jason Pinnock's 102-yard pick-six.\nStock down after the loss: S Isaiah Simmons. The 2020 top-10 pick, acquired by the Giants via trade last month, started in the place of Micah McFadden (ankle) at linebacker but failed to make a significant impact. He just wasn't able to shed blockers with any regularity. -- Jordan Raanan\nNext game: at Bills (Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET)\nThe Lions run a reverse flea-flicker that results in Sam LaPorta's second touchdown of the game.\nIs Kenny Pickett back on track? After struggling for three quarters, Kenny Pickett found George Pickens with a 41-yard touchdown pass to slip past the Ravens for a massive AFC North win. Pickett had hit Pickens two plays earlier on a perfectly placed back-shoulder throw for a 21-yard gain to set up the touchdown. That was his third career go-ahead touchdown pass in the final two minutes of regulation, the most of any player since the start of last season. Pickett has been shaky through the first month of the season, but entering the bye week, this gives the Steelers and their quarterback a significant boost.\nStock up after the win: Inside linebackers. This group was responsible for the biggest hits of the afternoon, including two third-down stops in the fourth quarter by Cole Holcomb and Elandon Roberts. Plus, Kwon Alexander had a sack and two tackles for loss -- including a key tackle for loss in the fourth quarter that led to a safety two plays later.\nStock down after the win: TE Gunner Olszewski. With Calvin Austin III hampered by an injury, Olszewski took up return duties and had a massive fumble in the second half. Joey Porter Jr.'s first career interception kept points off the board, but Olszewski's fumble comes after another error in the first week of the season. -- Brooke Pryor\nNext game: at Rams (Sunday, Oct. 22, 4:05 p.m. ET)\nHow big of a collapse was this for the Ravens? Baltimore went from seizing control of the division -- over an 80% projected favorite, according to ESPN Analytics -- to falling into a first-place tie with Pittsburgh and breathing life into its biggest rival. If the Ravens had won, they would have swept all three of their AFC North road games for the third time in franchise history. Instead, Baltimore let Sunday's game slip away with a Lamar Jackson interception in the end zone, five dropped passes, its ninth fumble of the season and a blocked punt. Now the Ravens head to London, the site of their biggest margin of defeat under coach John Harbaugh.\nStock up after the loss: LB Roquan Smith. In 15 games with Smith, Baltimore has allowed an NFL-best 13.8 points per game. The Ravens' defense hadn't allowed a touchdown in nine straight quarters before that 41-yard touchdown catch by George Pickens.\nStock down after the loss: QB Lamar Jackson. Mistakes continue to haunt Jackson, who threw an interception and fumbled in the fourth quarter. This was Jackson's fourth interception in the end zone of his career and seventh fumble of the season. -- Jamison Hensley\nNext game: vs. Titans in London (Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET)\nTyreek Hill gets behind the Giants' defense and scores a 69-yard touchdown for the Dolphins.\nCan the Saints sustain their offensive success? The Saints haven't had any momentum on offense dating back to last season, and they got their share of criticism after scoring only nine points in a loss to the Buccaneers last week. The Saints did what they've wanted to do all season: establish the run game and spread the ball around. Now they need to figure out a way to keep it going next week against the Houston Texans ... and beyond.\nStock up after the win: Offensive playmakers. Foster Moreau, Alvin Kamara and Chris Olave scored their first TDs of the season, Michael Thomas had a season-best in receiving yards and the Saints (offense and defense) hit the 30-point mark for the first time since Oct. 20, 2022.\nStock down after the win: TE Jimmy Graham. There admittedly weren't many options here following the Saints' best game of the season, but Graham couldn't haul in his only pass from Derek Carr in what likely would have resulted in a first down. -- Katherine Terrell\nNext game: at Texans (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nHow much longer will Bill Belichick stick with QB Mac Jones? Jones was coming off a nightmare performance in Week 4 against the Cowboys, and it only got worse against the Saints. He should have taken a sack in the first quarter but instead forced a fluttering pass under pressure that was returned for a pick-six by Tyrann Mathieu. It was all downhill from there. Yes, the OL is struggling. And yes, the pass-catchers struggle to gain separation consistently. But Jones' decision-making in that situation highlights one of the major issues holding back the offense -- turnovers that turn into points for the opposition. Backups Bailey Zappe (who replaced Jones in the fourth quarter) or Will Grier might not be an upgrade, but Jones' slide the past two weeks is a major concern.\nStock up after the loss: Demario Douglas. The rookie receiver nicknamed Pop provided the only pop for the team's offense with a 24-yard catch in the first quarter -- he's a promising prospect who should be part of the solution when he returns from concussion protocol.\nStock down after the loss: Bill Belichick. When a team shows no spark at home coming off a blowout loss on the road, it reflects poorly on the head coach. -- Mike Reiss\nNext game: at Raiders (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET)\nShould the Colts rethink their usage of Anthony Richardson? The Colts drafted the quarterback with the intent of using him as a runner and passer to fully take advantage of his unique skill set. But considering his latest injury -- he left the game with an injured right shoulder and did not return -- the Colts might have to rethink how they deploy their franchise quarterback. The Colts ranked fourth in the NFL in designed quarterback runs coming into Week 5, and Richardson's injury on Sunday came -- you guessed it -- on a designed quarterback run.\nStock up after the win: The offensive line. The unit was subjected to heavy criticism last season, but this group has bounced back to bolster a surprisingly productive running game. On Sunday, running back Zack Moss was the benefactor, running for a career-high 165 yards and two touchdowns.\nStock down after the win: The edge rushers. They had been productive in previous weeks, but the group -- led by defensive end Samson Ebukam -- was rendered ineffective against the pass Sunday. The Colts finished with one sack, allowing Titans QB Ryan Tannehill sufficient time to consistently throw down the field. -- Stephen Holder\nNext game: at Jaguars (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWhat happened to the Titans' red zone offense? Entering Sunday, the Titans' red zone scoring percentage was 38.4, ranking 29th in the NFL. Tennessee's red zone woes continued against the Colts, as the Titans cashed in on only one of their four visits inside the 20. They must find ways to get receiver DeAndre Hopkins involved in the red zone, especially on a day when he finally got loose and made a mark elsewhere on the field. The Titans keep finding themselves in close-scoring games, which makes scoring touchdowns in the red zone critical.\nStock up after the loss: Hopkins. The receiver was virtually unstoppable against the Colts as he posted eight receptions for 148 yards, marking the first 100-yard receiving performance by a Titans wideout since Week 11 last season.\nStock down after the loss: Kristian Fulton. The cornerback struggled mightily on multiple plays, starting with a blown coverage in zone defense, then a pair of pass interference penalties, and finally, he got turned around on another play by a Colts receiver. -- Turron Davenport\nNext game: vs. Ravens in London (Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET)\nAfter a rough start, is this victory a sign the Jaguars are going to be a factor in the AFC after all? QB Trevor Lawrence has said multiple times that you're measured by what you do against the league's best teams. The Jaguars failed against Kansas City in Week 2, but against the Bills -- one of the hottest teams in the NFL -- the Jaguars dominated time of possession, yardage and third downs. So by Lawrence's measure, the answer is yes. There are still concerns -- especially along the offensive line -- but the Jaguars now have a critical tiebreaker over the Bills when it comes to playoff seeding.\nStock up after the win: Defensive coordinator Mike Caldwell. The Bills averaged 41 points in their previous three games, but Caldwell called perhaps his best game of the past two seasons by being aggressive. The Jaguars blitzed Josh Allen on 32% of his dropbacks (12 of 37) and Allen completed just 4 of 11 passes for 41 yards on those plays.\nStock down after the win: The offensive line. It continues to be a major issue, with penalties by Anton Harrison (two) and Brandon Scherff, a bad snap by Luke Fortner, and whiffs by Cam Robinson that stalled drives, stole points and resulted in turnovers. -- Mike DiRocco\nNext game: vs. Colts (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nWas this offensive performance a one-off or something that will be an issue going forward? There's reason for concern, but not alarm. Jet lag isn't to blame for a Bills offense (which had scored 37 or more points in the previous three games) being held to 20 points. The Bills gave up on the running game, finishing with only 13 carries for 29 yards. Quarterback Josh Allen also struggled with pressure, resulting in an inability to sustain long drives. It's nothing that can't be corrected, but a lack of balance can't become a theme.\nStock up after the loss: AJ Epenesa. With the Bills dealing with multiple injuries at defensive end, Epenesa stepped up with a strip sack and fumble recovery, two total sacks, three tackles and three batted passes -- becoming the first player since J.J. Watt in 2014 to have two sacks and three batted passes in a game.\nStock down after the loss: The linebacking corps. The Bills lost Matt Milano to a knee injury in the first quarter. The defense allowed Jacksonville to march up and down the field, dominate time of possession and rush for over 150 yards. -- Alaina Getzenberg\nNext game: vs. Giants (Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET)\nGeorge Pickens hauls in the dime from Kenny Pickett to give the Steelers a 14-10 lead late in the fourth quarter.\nWill the Bears commit their offensive identity around DJ Moore? Justin Fields has appeared his most comfortable when targeting Moore, who accounted for 230 receiving yards and three touchdowns against Washington. The wide receiver's 141 yards after the catch accounted for half of Fields' passing yardage, and the quarterback has looked more polished as a passer in the Bears' past two games. Fields pointed out how often he saw Moore one-on-one with a Washington defender, which should change against better defenses. How Fields adjusts to those changes will speak to the direction of the offense.\nStock up after the win: Teven Jenkins. The Bears left guard was activated off injured reserve hours before Chicago's win and kept Washington's stout DT duo in check while playing on a snap count.\nStock down after the win: The running backs. Chicago was down to fullback Khari Blasingame against the Commanders after losing Khalil Herbert, Roschon Johnson and Travis Homer because of in-game injuries. -- Courtney Cronin\nNext game: at Falcons (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)\nAfter such an ugly loss, where's the hope? Quarterback Sam Howell has played two productive games in a row, throwing for a combined 678 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. He has posted a 79.4 quarterback rating in the past two games combined on third downs. If the defense ever gets turned around, Washington can gain momentum. After five games last season, the defense ranked 25th in points and 17th in yards; it finished seventh and third, respectively. Without another turnaround, jobs will be lost.\nStock up after the loss: DE Chase Young. While the defense in general has struggled, Young had a season-high 36.4 percent pass rush win rate vs. Chicago, and he now has three sacks in four games.\nStock down after the loss: The defense. Washington surrendered five plays of 25 yards or more against Chicago, giving the Commanders an NFL-high 16 such plays for the season. The secondary's attention to detail has been poor; rookie corner Emmanuel Forbes has struggled mightily and the entire unit has failed to produce big plays (one takeaway in the past three games combined). -- John Keim\nNext game: vs. Vikings (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)"}
{"title": "Canelo Alvarez is fighting in May, but who should be his opponent?", "date": "2023-10-09 15:39:44", "text": "Canelo Alvarez remains the undisputed super middleweight champion after his third defense, a dominant decision win over Jermell Charlo last month in Las Vegas.\nBoxing's top star has competed twice at light heavyweight but appears settled in at 168 pounds, where his last three fights have occurred. At 33 years old, and with his Hall of Fame legacy secured, where does Alvarez go from here?\nESPN's No. 4 pound-for-pound boxer will return on Cinco de Mayo, but when asked whom he wanted to face, he responded \"I don't f---ing care. ... Nobody can compete with this Canelo.\"\nWell, guess what? We care. With that in mind, here's a look at the field of possible opponents for Alvarez's next fight. The Mexican has two fights remaining on his deal with PBC, so we'll focus on options from that \"side of the street.\"\nWhich fighters are in the running for a shot at a career-high payday? And who has the best chance of winning it? Let's break down the contestants:\nBenavidez is by far the most viable option for Alvarez if he can deliver a statement victory against Demetrius Andrade on Nov. 25 in Las Vegas.\nBenavidez is one of the most entertaining action fighters in the sport and has been lobbying for a bout with Alvarez for years. Benavidez, 26, is coming off a career-best victory, a decision over Caleb Plant in March.\nBenavidez's swarming, pressure style is a load to contend with, as is his power. He's shown the ability to break down quality opponents as fights wear on, but he's never faced someone as talented as Alvarez.\nThis feels like a megafight if Benavidez can come through with an explosive victory over Andrade and build momentum heading into the new year.\n\"I'm focused on Andrade,\" Benavidez told ESPN on Sunday. \"But after this fight, the WBC should mandate the No. 1 contender. After I beat Andrade, we'll be in a pretty good spot to make the fight [against Alvarez] happen for me.\"\nIf Andrade can pull off the upset when he meets Benavidez, he could find himself in pole position to be Alvarez's next challenger.\nThe former two-division champion has long been one of boxing's most-avoided fighters for good reason.\nAn athletic southpaw who's hard to find in the ring, Andrade is undefeated through 32 pro fights. Now 35 years old and in his third weight class, Andrade will have the opportunity to showcase his ability in a major fight he's long yearned for.\nIf \"Boo Boo\" can resemble the elite boxer we've seen when he's at his best, he's a tough fighter to beat. And if Andrade defeats Benavidez, there's already a built-in storyline for a fight with Canelo.\nAfter Alvarez defeated Billy Joe Saunders in May 2021, Andrade crashed the news conference. Canelo responded with a bundle of expletives and a critique of Andrade's competition.\n\"Get the f--- out of here,\" Alvarez told Andrade. \"... You've fought with nobody.\"\nAlvarez has proved he has no problem fighting tricky southpaws, defeating Austin Trout and Erislandy Lara. Andrade can get his opportunity. He first must beat Benavidez.\nCrawford represents the biggest commercial option for Alvarez, a true superfight, but Alvarez didn't seem too interested in that bout at the postfight news conference after beating Charlo.\n\"I always say if the fight makes sense, why not? But [Crawford is] not in the plan,\" Alvarez said.\nThe matchup makes plenty of financial sense for both fighters, but Alvarez has expressed dismay in the past about fighting a much smaller man. Crawford, ESPN's No. 1 pound-for-pound boxer, has never competed above 147 pounds.\nAnd Alvarez, who calls the shots as the sport's top star, isn't going to make any weight concessions.\nBut never say never. Crawford vs. Alvarez represents the biggest money-making event of all the options, so it can't be counted out.\nCharlo was originally slated to fight Alvarez last month, but before the matchup was set, twin brother Jermell stepped in as \"Big Charlo\" dealt with a personal matter.\n\"Same size, same everything. I don't really care which Charlo brother it is,\" Alvarez told ESPN during fight week.\nJermell's lackluster performance against Alvarez likely killed any revenge angle for Jermall. Jermell's strategy against Alvarez produced little action and often elicited boos from the Las Vegas crowd.\nWhile his opportunity might be slipping away, Jermall is set to end a two-and-a-half-year layoff when he fights Jose Benavidez Jr. on the Nov. 25 undercard of Benavidez-Andrade.\nJermall, the WBC middleweight champion who is now training with Roy Jones Jr., last competed in June 2021 when he defeated Juan Macias Montiel.\nBivol is with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom, but he remains a contender to square off with Alvarez because of his win over Canelo in May 2022.\nThat bout, which took place at 175 pounds, wasn't remotely competitive as Bivol proved far too accurate and slick. Alvarez has insisted he wanted Bivol for his second fight of 2023, but only if it took place at 175 pounds.\nBivol, meanwhile, said he was only interested in a rematch for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championship.\nThat didn't happen in September, and it appears unlikely we will see an encore encounter between Alvarez and Bivol in May 2024. Still, the Russian remains the toughest challenger for Alvarez's four 168-pound belts.\n\"He looked good in the fight against Charlo,\" Bivol told ESPN. \"But I did not see anything new from when we last fought.\"\nThe loss clearly still bothers Alvarez, who maintains that he's a better fighter than Bivol and has pointed to his injured left wrist, which required surgery, as a reason for his performance.\nBivol is one spot behind Canelo at No. 5 on ESPN's pound-for-pound list.\nAdames seems like a long-shot option, but he's been adamant on social media that he's in the running.\nThe Dominican signed with Top Rank in 2018 as a much-ballyhooed welterweight prospect. He struggled with the company, and following a loss to Patrick Teixeira at 154 pounds in 2019, Adames was released.\nHe's found new life with PBC at middleweight, rattling off four wins, three of them inside the distance. At 29 years old, Adames feels more than ready for the life-changing opportunity.\n\"I won't run like Jermell. I have more merit than a lot of Canelo's opponents,\" Adames wrote on X . \" ... I have hurt big champions in sparring because I am a big 160.\""}
{"title": "Ancelotti's management of Modric's minutes could be a masterstroke", "date": "2023-10-10 09:53:15", "text": "If you only listen to the doom-mongers or place blind faith in the tone of most Real Madrid news conferences this season, then you probably fear that Luka Modric and Carlo Ancelotti are at a breaking point. You might worry too that the Croatia international has been stomping around Los Blancos' training ground with a face like thunder, as their relationship lurches towards a bitter end.\nNevertheless, Madrid's brilliant playmaker might well end up needing to send his shrewd boss a vintage bottle of Svrdlovina red wine (the best from Modric's Zadar region of Croatia), plus a nice selection of Ancelotti's preferred Italian ham (of which he admits to being inordinately fond), if Ancelotti's unpopular tactic works out. The thinking: reducing Modric's game time ends with him being in supreme shape to drive Madrid and Croatia to trophies next summer.\nThree facts feed into the river of speculation that Modric might get sufficiently fed up and leave for greener pastures in January despite having renewed his contract as recently as June.\nFirst: it's certainly unusual that this midfield genius has only played 392 minutes so far this season, and that he's started a meagre four times in Madrid's 11 matches across all competitions. Second: some of the Spanish media's insistence on prodding Ancelotti every three days about whether Modric and he have a tense relationship stems from very well-sourced \"leaks\" that the Croat has been annoyed at his sudden drop in appearances.\nFinally: Last month, Modric himself spoke on the subject to a Croatian newspaper, Sportske Novosti: \"Nobody's happy when they aren't playing. After a career like mine, that feeling is especially unusual. Madrid wanted me to stay and I had the same aim, so when I signed, the only condition I placed was that they treated me as a competitive player and didn't consider me only based on past triumphs.\n\"They told me nothing would change in my status, and that's why I re-signed. But hey, the coach has his own reasons, and I won't sink down or diminish my intensity because of this -- quite the opposite.\"\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nModric is, after all, known to his teammates as \"Mr. Vinegar\" -- it's a nickname he hates, but it's earned because when he loses in training, or more particularly in a big match, he's prone to being sour-faced and grumpy-natured until the painful experiences are processed. Born winners are like that.\nI guess what whipped things into a real frenzy was that one of Modric's rare starts -- think of it as a precious opportunity to prove his coach wrong -- was against Atletico Madrid just over a fortnight ago. Madrid were demolished 3-1 and our guy was unceremoniously replaced by Joselu at half-time, which is an extreme rarity right across the Croat's near-1,000-match career unless injured.\nThen, along comes Saturday's performance against Osasuna. Not only do Madrid produce by far their most elegant, fluent, dangerous and productive football of the entire season, but they scored four times while also keeping a clean sheet.\nModric wasn't the only hero of that victory, but he was absolutely stellar, his \"this won't sink me, quite the contrary\" attitude evident across 79 brilliant minutes.\nThe basic facts are that he was on the ball 102 times -- far more than anyone else on the pitch, even those who completed the full 94 minutes. Indeed only two players, Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong and Modric's teammate, Toni Kroos, have been on the ball more times in a single match all season.\nMore than that, Modric orchestrated Madrid's brilliance with 94 passes, more than any of Los Blancos' players has attempted in any match this season. He departed with the match long since tucked away, the result filed under \"terrific win and performance,\" to a thunderous standing ovation, about which Ancelotti said: \"That was the usual Modric, quality, commitment and he deserved the fans acclaim when he left the pitch.\"\nThe Italian went further, at least indirectly, by stating that the key to Madrid playing with such confident, aggressive fluidity was going 1-0 up so early in what promised to be a tough test. (Los Blancos have gone 1-0 down in five of their 11 matches so far.) No coincidence that it was Modric whose superb pass into the penalty area found Dani Carvajal's feet so that the full-back could set up Bellingham to fire home and, according to Ancelotti, put Madrid in top gear.\nBack to the point I made at the top of this column.\nModric has had two principal reasons to exhibit his vinegar nature. First, he thought that when he agreed his contract extension things would be identical to last season -- only they haven't been. He's not, and has never been, a guy to believe or even wish that the training ground environment is a hierarchy instead of a meritocracy. \"Nobody's ever gifted me anything\" is one of his favourite phrases; Modric knows that irrespective of past glories, you earn your status every single damn day.\nThe beautiful game lives here. Stream top leagues, tournaments and teams.\nSign up for ESPN+\nFRIDAY, OCT. 20 (all times ET)\n• Dortmund vs. Werder Bremen (2 p.m.)\n• Rotherham vs. Ipswich Town (3 p.m.)\n• Osasuna vs. Granada (3 p.m.)\nSATURDAY, OCT. 21 (all times ET)\n• Wolfsburg vs. Leverkusen (9 a.m.)\n• Norwich City vs. Leeds United (10 a.m.)\n• Sevilla vs. Real Madrid (12 p.m.)\n• Mainz vs. Bayern Munich (12 p.m.)\n• PSV vs. Fortuna Sittard (1 p.m.)\n• Feyenoord vs. Vitesse (3 p.m.)\n• Celta Vigo vs. Atletico Madrid (3 p.m.)\nHe's been miffed because he felt that the tone of his agreement with Ancelotti was that he'd be starting most games even if the intense competition -- Eduardo Camavinga, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Kroos, Fede Valverde, Dani Ceballos and now Jude Bellingham -- might mean he completed 90 minutes less regularly. Instead he's having to fight and scrap to get into the starting XI, and so far it's been a losing battle.\nThe other point is that all true \"greats\" earn their success because they have a potent mix of talent, ego and street-fighting toughness. Modric is brimming with all these so, to be blunt, his dignity has been ruffled. If he wasn't outright ticked off at his situation, he wouldn't be the Luka Modric who started his Madrid career being ridiculed by the Spanish media (literally ... Marca ran a poll in which he was voted the worst signing of the season) yet has become, by far, one of their best, most influential and admirable players of the past 30 years.\nBut here's the point. Did you catch that stat earlier? Modric is 45 matches away from 1,000 senior games in his career -- a vast and tiring number. At 38, the stats show, with clarity, that he's towards the bottom of the Madrid charts for most sprints, most sprints with intensity and for average number of kilometres covered in a match.\nSince June 2022, Modric has played 75 times for club and country, and he's still not retired from the international level -- he's still his nation's captain -- with crucial matches to come, including at home to Euro 2024 qualifying Group D co-leaders Turkey on Thursday and away to Wales next week. All of which is to make clear why this warrior-wizard might need to start thinking about which gifts he should present to his coach by the end of a long, grueling season.\nHerculez Gomez explains why he thinks a move to Real Madrid would benefit Alphonso Davies.\nModric's agent was having sweet nothings whispered in his ear by David Beckham in Dubrovnik last month and boy: how sexy would it be if the Croat wound down his playing days at Inter Miami CF with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba? Whatever: the way things are going this term, you'd not be foolish to speculate that this might be Modric's swansong season at Madrid. In which case he'll crave lifting LaLiga, the Champions League, the Copa del Rey, or all three. In short, another signature season.\nBest of all would be crowning his extraordinary career by leading Croatia to their first senior trophy after a 2018 World Cup final defeat in Moscow, finishing third in Qatar last year and losing the UEFA Nations League final to Spain on penalties in June.\nCan you envisage Modric reaching the crucial, decisive months of April to July brimming with energy and a burning sense of \"I'll show everyone\" thanks to Ancelotti's careful management of his playing time? And then being central to his team, or teams, lifting a trophy?\nI can and, if so, then Mr. Vinegar might end up owing more than just a couple of gifts to Mr. Ancelotti."}

Well, f--- him and f--- them. This ain't about them. This is about us getting back on the right track. Let's win this b---- for Hackett.\"\nPrescott, who threw three interceptions in the Cowboys' 42-10 loss to the 49ers, was honest about the team's performance:\n\"Didn't see it coming. ... And I got punched in the mouth.\" \nThe Dolphins put up 524 yards against the Giants to bring their total to 2,568 for the season, which is the most yards through the first five games of a season in NFL history.\nHowever, if McDaniel's tongue-in-cheek response is any indication, Miami isn't satisfied:\n\"Mission accomplished ... the whole offseason that was our goal ... output after five games.\" \nThe Patriots have allowed 34 points in back-to-back games and scored fewer than three points for the first time in Belichick's tenure.\nTheir 55 points through five games is the team's lowest since 1995, and the 34-0 loss to the Saints was the largest home shutout loss in franchise history. Belichick succinctly acknowledged the team's recent struggles:\n\"We're gonna start over again.\" \nAfter Burrow and the Bengals put up a season-high 34 points, he revealed that an Ohio-born musician helped style his outfit for Week 5.\n\"My friend Scott, as many people know as Kid Cudi ... All of my friends put this outfit together for me. I've got great friends.\" \nPorter Jr.'s first interception was a timely one. The rookie corner picked off Lamar Jackson in one-on-one coverage against Odell Beckham Jr. on third down. The turnover was a significant play, as Pittsburgh's offense scored the go-ahead touchdown on the following drive.\nAfter grabbing the pick, Porter Jr. immediately knew what to do with the ball:\n\"Earlier this week, Coach T was like, 'Get a pick and hand it to me on the sideline.' So that's exactly what I did. I handed it right to him.\" "}

But now things seemed a little less certain. Ahead of her opening-round match at the China Open last week, Swiatek said she was feeling \"really anxious\" and she later said she struggled with confidence and self-belief since her early exit in New York.\nBut despite all the emotions and lingering doubt, Swiatek not only won her first match in Beijing, but she went on to win the tournament. Dropping just one set and defeating top-10 players Caroline Garcia and Coco Gauff en route to the final, Swiatek routed Liudmila Samsonova 6-2, 6-2 on Sunday in just 69 minutes for her first 1000-level trophy of the year.\nSwiatek couldn't help but tear up at the end of the match.\n\"I cried a little bit after because I know how tough it was for us to kind of, I don't know, stay positive and stay focused on the future,\" Swiatek told reporters later. \"Maybe not for us, but for me. I felt huge support from my team during these past weeks. I was really just grateful for that.\"\nIGA DOING IGA TYPE THINGS 🏆👑@iga_swiatek secures her first Hologic WTA 1000 trophy of the season and her 16th career title!!!#ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/OEyBL5lbwK\nIt marked her fifth title of 2023, and she became the first woman to win five or more titles in back-to-back seasons since Serena Williams did so in 2014 and 2015. She also became the first player in WTA history to win six 1000-level titles before turning 23.\n\"I feel like this tournament will give me confidence for the rest of my career that there's always a chance to overcome and work on what you do or what you feel,\" Swiatek said. \"You can always get better. Sometimes it's pretty easy, but we tend to make it more complicated in our heads.\"\nSwiatek will now turn her focus to the WTA Finals, where she will have a chance to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Aryna Sabalenka. If she were to do so, or take over the top spot at any point, she said she would be better prepared for the role this time around.\n\"I think if I learn and take lessons from it, it's going to be easier,\" Swiatek said. \"But for sure the first thing is getting there. I'll just try to do that. For now, step by step. I'll just celebrate this trophy.\"\nHere's what else you might have missed from around the tennis world this week:\nWhile Swiatek and Sabalenka had clinched their spots for the WTA Finals last month, as had Gauff, Elena Rybakina and Jessica Pegula, the remaining three spots were up for grabs at the China Open.\nAnd after officially clinching the remaining bids, Ons Jabeur, Karolina Muchova and Marketa Vondrousova celebrated together with -- what else? -- a video on Instagram. Filmed and posted by Jabeur, who nabbed the eighth and final spot for the year-end tournament, the three-time major finalist is seen saying, \"Girls, let's go, it's this way,\" before panning to Muchova and Vondrousova. \"Cancun, it's this way,\" Jabeur then says as Vondrousova shouts, \"Yes!\"\nA post shared by Ons Jabeur أنس جابر (@onsjabeur)\nAfter pulling off a dominant 7-6 (4), 6-1 victory over Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals at the China Open, Jannik Sinner entered the tournament's final on Wednesday with momentum on his side, but with history very much against him.\nFacing 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, Sinner had lost in all six of their previous meetings, including during two finals this season. But the 22-year-old Sinner had an answer for everything that came his way and he won the hard-fought battle 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2).\n\"Daniil, thanks for letting me win at least one match,\" Sinner said jokingly during the trophy ceremony. \"We have had some very tough battles, especially this year. Thanks for making me a much better player. I have been training a lot to beat you.\"\n🏆 CHAMPION IN BEIJING 🏆The moment @janniksin claimed his 9th career title, and defeated Medvedev for the first time!#ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/dCWQnTRknf\nThe victory marked Sinner's third title of the year and ninth overall. He is now at a career-high ranking of No. 4 and, after reaching the Round of 32 in Shanghai on Saturday, qualified for the ATP Finals for the first time. Sinner later said reaching the year-end event, which will be held in his native Italy, was his \"main goal of the season.\"\n\"I'm very happy I'm officially going to be in Turin in front of the home crowd there,\" Sinner told the ATP. \"It means a lot.\"\nMedvedev, Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic have also secured their spots for the tournament, with four berths remaining.\nIt's been a challenging year for 22-time major champion Rafael Nadal. The 37-year-old hasn't played since January due to a hip injury and subsequent surgery, and he revealed the 2024 season would likely be his last on tour. With such a long layoff from play and with retirement looming, it seemed unclear if and when he would actually be able to return, but Nadal silenced the doubters last week by posting some practice footage on Instagram.\nHitting the court at his academy in Mallorca, Spain, Nadal can be seen moving side-to-side and hitting forehands and backhands, and, best of all, appearing to be pain-free. As the Australian Open's account commented on the post, \"2024 loading.\"\nA post shared by Rafa Nadal (@rafaelnadal)\nFormer French Open finalist, five-time major doubles champion and world No. 5 Lucie Safarova retired from the sport in 2019. She has since gotten married, welcomed two children and has been living her best, no-longer-a-professional-athlete life. She has repeatedly said she has no plans of making a comeback to the sport.\nRemember everything you just read because this is where it might get confusing.\nLast week, the 36-year-old signed up to play in an ITF event in Reims, France, as a wild card. She won her opening-round match and was also slated to play in the doubles draw alongside her 17-year-old niece Emma Dvorackova. However, Safarova was forced to withdraw ahead of her second-round singles match.\n\"Sadly, I won't be able to continue my run at the [tournament] in Reims,\" Safarova wrote on Instagram. \"Although I only wanted to use my time on court as preparation for an exhibition tournament later this month, and to play doubles with my niece, my participation has been qualified as an 'official return to professional tennis' and it needed to be signaled to the ITF prior to competing.\"\nA post shared by Lucie Safarova (@lucie.safarova)\nSo, to summarize, Safarova had to withdraw from a professional tennis tournament because she doesn't want to play professional tennis. And that concludes the non-comeback comeback of Lucie Safarova.\nRising American star and US Open semifinalist Ben Shelton turned 21 on Monday. Shelton was given not one, but two cakes in the players lounge at the Shanghai Masters event. And sure, his cake-cutting skills need a little work, but he still seemed to enjoy the celebration all the same.\nHappy 21st Birthday @BenShelton 🥳🎂Got there in the end slicing the cake! 🫠#RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/dt4R2cuyG7"}
{"title": "NWSL by the numbers: Why Portland Thorns are best of 2023 and who ranks as worst", "date": "2023-10-10 15:29:21", "text": "As the National Women's Soccer League's regular season pushes towards the postseason in all of its chaotic, anything-could-happen glory, we're gifted with a chance to reflect before the playoff field is set.\nArmed with a nearly full season's worth of information on all 12 teams and their players, we can ask (and answer!) questions like... Who has the best attack in the NWSL? Which team has struggled most defensively? And who is the best shot-stopper in the league?\nSo, to look back on what has been a truly memorable 2023 NWSL campaign so far, we're running through a list of superlatives -- and we're doing it by the numbers. Here's what the data has to say about, well, all sorts of things before the regular season concludes this weekend amid a multi-team fight for the remaining playoffs spots.\nWith a roster full of stars, the Portland Thorns take home this year's honor as the NWSL's best attacking team. Not only have they scored more goals than any other team in the league (41), but they've created the most xG, or expected goals (38.3, per FBref) in the NWSL.\nTheir high xG tally indicates that coach Mike Norris' group regularly moves the ball into dangerous parts of the field to find high-quality shots. According to American Soccer Analysis, this year's Portland team has created more xG per game than all but five teams in their database of NWSL teams, going back to the 2016 regular season.\nWith Sam Coffey starting attacks with laser-sharp distribution from the base of midfield, Portland have a sharp No. 6. They have plenty of chance-creators, too, with Morgan Weaver out wide and a combination of Crystal Dunn, Christine Sinclair, and Olivia Moultrie in the middle. Finally, with Sophia Smith -- who's back in training after an MCL sprain -- finishing attacks with her direct runs and clever movement, Portland have a world-class No. 9.\nPortland's goal-scoring recipe works, folks.\nHouston Dash fans: cover your eyes.\nThe Dash have been historically bad at putting the ball into the back of the net this season. They've scored the fewest goals in the league (16), which would put them as the fifth-lowest scoring team in NWSL history on a per-game basis if the season ended today.\nTo cap things off, the Dash are also second-to-last in the league in xG (21.8, per FBref).\nAfter firing head coach Sam Laity in September, it's time for a bigger rebuild in Houston.\nSure, their opponents have found a few extra fluky goals in 2023, but no team in the NWSL has better underlying defensive numbers than the San Diego Wave.\nPer FBref, coach Casey Stoney's team has allowed the smallest amount of non-penalty xG in the league this season (1.00 per 90). With a well-drilled back four featuring Naomi Girma -- the biggest U.S. women's national team star in their short World Cup campaign earlier this year -- San Diego have the league's best defensive anchor.\nThe Wave bend, conceding right around 50% possession to their opponents and allowing the third-most passes per defensive action in the league according to Opta, but they rarely break.\nThe Chicago Red Stars have taken some big blows this season. They've allowed 47 goals, a number that puts them third all-time in the ASA database for goals conceded per game.\nWhen Mallory Swanson went down with a season-ending knee injury while on duty with the U.S. women's national team in April, Chicago's entire season changed. Their team, once centered on Swanson's mobile, fluid attacking brilliance, suddenly didn't have a center at all.\nWith Swanson sidelined, the Red Stars lost their attacking outlet and resorted to playing against the ball. Per TruMedia, the Red Stars have faced more shots against (326) this season than any other team. They also have a problem with conceding first and being unable to fight back -- they are tied for the most losses after conceding first (10), and they've never won after conceding first this season.\nThey've been under far too much defensive pressure for far too long in 2023.\nWhen paired with their elite players, Portland's pressing ability has helped them become the attacking juggernaut that we see near the top of the table. According to Opta, the Thorns have scored seven goals via high turnovers -- defined as \"sequences that start in open play and begin 40 meters or less from the opposing goal.\" That's three more goals than any of Portland's NWSL opponents.\nThe Thorns have also created more shots from high turnovers (53) than the rest of the league, all while picking their moments to press.\nPortland allow 10.7 passes before intervening defensively. That figure paints them as one of the league's more frequent pressing teams, but still shows them as being more passive than a third of the league. Yet you don't have to have the pedal to the metal all the time to be a ruthless pressing team.\nSure, their 2023 campaign is still hanging in the balance, but at least Racing Louisville have the distinction of being the fastest, most direct team in the league. Right?\nHeading into the final weekend of the regular season, Louisville have the highest direct speed in the NWSL, according to Opta. They're moving the ball forward and towards the opposing goal at a speed of 2.05 meters per second.\nNow, Louisville aren't opposed to stringing some passes together -- they're eighth in the league in 10-plus pass sequences under manager Kim Björkegren -- but the key component of their attacking game plan is clear: find midfielder Savannah DeMelo in transition as much as possible.\nWhere Racing Louisville are vertical, North Carolina are horizontal.\nAccording to Opta, the Courage have a direct speed of just 1.39, meaning that they move the ball forward and towards the opposition's goal at a speed of 1.39 meters per second. That number provides a stark contrast with Louisville, and it also puts North Carolina well behind the second-most patient team in the league (Gotham FC, 1.58 direct speed).\nThe Courage love their long, slaloming passing sequences -- they lead the league in 10-plus pass sequences with 251 (more than double second-place Portland, who have 123), though the next step has to be more efficiency in the final third. North Carolina are 10th in the NWSL in xG, per FBref.\nThough the Spirit have become well-known for their aggressive defending this season, their biggest strength has been on set pieces. No one has created more chances from dead balls than Washington and their 9.5 set piece xG in 2023, according to Opta.\nZooming out to look at both the attacking and defensive side, Washington have a +4 xG differential on set pieces (best in the NWSL) and +3 goal differential (second in the NWSL), per Opta.\nWith midfielder Ashley Sanchez and defender Sam Staab both strong on dead balls, you can't blink against the Spirit.\nThe Courage have clearly put a lot of time and effort into their open play tactical setup. Under head coach Sean Nahas, North Carolina average more possession (53.4%) than any other team in the NWSL. While teams spend time on both open play tactics and set piece approaches in training, it's safe to say that the Courage have struggled to apply the same level of focus and detail on dead balls as they have in the run of play.\nAccording to Opta, North Carolina have created the fewest chances on set pieces (2.78 xG) in the league, while scoring the fewest set piece goals (1). Factoring in defensive set pieces, the Courage have the worst xG differential on dead balls in the league, along with the second-worst actual goal differential (-3).\nWhenever their season ends -- in the playoffs or next week after their final match of the regular season -- set pieces may be the Courage's undoing.\nNo team in the NWSL has committed more fouls this season than the Spirit. According to FBref, they've wracked up 247 fouls, which is 20 more than the next team in the league (Angel City and Racing Louisville are both tied at 227).\nThere's almost certainly a connection between the largely vertical, forward-thinking tactical approach that coach Mark Parsons has relied on this year and his team's foul numbers. Washington's 1.85 direct speed puts them third in the league in that metric and they have fewer 10-plus pass sequences than every team outside of Angel City and Louisville.\nThe Spirit want to move the ball upfield quickly -- and they're not afraid to get in your grill along the way.\nSophia Smith has been on another planet this year. Even though she hasn't played since the end of August due to injury, Smith still leads the league in both total goals (11) and non-penalty goals (10). She also leads players with at least 500 minutes in non-penalty xG per 90 (0.56), according to FBref.\nWith her astonishing speed, off-ball movement, and shot-creating ability, Smith is what makes the Thorns so sharp. After picking up 2022's NWSL MVP award, Smith has a right to that trophy again this year.\n\"FINE I'LL DO IT MYSELF\" 😤Sophia Smith scores the 28th goal of her NWSL career‼️ pic.twitter.com/JEZy9KuhGv\nMorgan Weaver is yet to get a serious look with the U.S. women's national team -- two substitute appearances in friendlies against Australia back in 2021 serve as the extent of her national team career -- but she's going to be difficult to ignore after this season.\nThe 25-year-old has had a career year when it comes to chance creation. She currently tops the NWSL in expected assists (5.8) and is second among players with at least 700 minutes in xA per 90 (0.30), according to FBref.\nHer shiftiness on the ball, combined with a lanky frame and creative vision, makes Weaver hard to shut down on either wing. That she plays alongside a finisher like the aforementioned Smith only makes her even better.\nDon't be surprised if she pops up in red, white and blue at some point in the next few international windows.\nIf you want pure, unadulterated fun, I kindly suggest you watch a few minutes of Kerolin. The 23-year-old Brazilian attacker has been, hands down, the biggest bright spot for the North Carolina Courage this year.\nNot only is she an impressive goal-scorer, with 10 goals to her name in 2023, but she also strikes fear into the hearts of opposing defenders on the dribble. Per FBref, Kerolin has completed more successful dribbles (67) than anyone else in the NWSL.\nWhat's more, according to ASA's goals-added metric, which measures a player's total on-ball contribution, Kerolin leads the league in value created via her dribbling, too.\nThere isn't a single defender in the NWSL who can consistently stop the young forward in the open field.\nAdmin has officially run out of words to describe Kerolin's talent at ⚽.Any help? @TheNCCourage. 😅 pic.twitter.com/bsXXeZKDh4\nMake that two years in a row of Katie Lund stealing the show in goal.\nThe 26-year-old was incredible in 2022, which was just her second year in the NWSL: she saved 6.9 goals more than expected, according to ASA's post-shot expected-goals metric, which measures the likelihood of a shot finding the back of the net based on its position on the goalmouth.\nAfter leading the league last year, Lund is at it again. She's saved 4.8 goals more than expected in 2023, beating out the rest of her positional peers by more than two goals.\nLund's name should be on the USWNT's radar."}

{"title": "How to maximize your lineup", "date": "2023-10-10 17:58:48", "text": "Connor Bedard catches up with Pat McAfee and A.J. Hawk ahead of his NHL debut for the Blackhawks. (1:47)\nThere are few worse feelings in fantasy sport than the nausea inspired by watching an player rack up a good number of (altogether useless) points on your bench. Such a depressing waste. Any manager with a large enough roster and the ability to make daily lineup adjustments can then speak to the frustration of being forced to choose between players on days when almost everyone is playing. Fourteen games on a busy Saturday? Cobbling together that active lineup requires a few tough decisions. So why not hack the schedule, so to speak, by investing in players who actually play more often when others don't? All else being somewhat equal, of course.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nEvery year a handful of teams feature more frequently on extra light schedules than others. Just like another bunch of clubs play more often on heavier timetables. Investing in fantasy commodities from the former over the latter immediately provides your roster with a boost. Simply by being on the ice when others aren't. Availability is the best ability, and all that jazz. You can bench them on the busier days when almost everyone else is playing and they're not.\nSo, setting the benchmark at six games - when another 20 teams, at minimum, are idle - we tabulated which clubs are booked to compete on so-called slower nights, from the season's start to conclusion. While the team out of Anaheim competes on 31 such lighter dates, the Tampa Bay Lightning figure in only 11. That's a wide gap worth respecting. As long as you're able to make daily adjustments, the ability to maximize your lineup every calendar date can make the difference between winning it all by season's end and falling just that little bit short.\nAnaheim Ducks: Just because they won't win as much as others doesn't mean the Ducks are devoid of valuable fantasy figures. Once more, Anaheim leads the NHL pack with the most games - a whopping 31 - on dates featuring six matchups or fewer. Heading into 2023-24, a healthy Troy Terry is endeavouring to crack 70 points for the first time in his young career. Same applies to Terry's linemate, and the club's top fantasy commodity up front, Trevor Zegras. Before suffering a lower-body injury, rookie Leo Carlsson was a standout in camp. Once recovered, the teen is hoping to stick with the NHL club for most of the campaign. Forward Mason McTavish is another fun asset with 60-point potential. On the blue line, Cam Fowler remains a perennially underrated fantasy performer who's going to pitch in regularly on the power play. Radko Gudas is a hitting machine, while young Jamie Drysdale is expected to take another stride or two forward in the production department after losing most of last year to a shoulder injury.\nChicago Blackhawks: If needing another reason to invest in the most exciting prospect out there, how about knowing the Blackhawks play a third of their scheduled games when most of the rest of the league is off? And Connor Bedard isn't the only fantasy skater who shines a little bit brighter because of that schedule imbalance. Unlike his teen linemate, who's overwhelmingly rostered across the ESPN.com universe, Taylor Hall is much more available. As is second-line center Lukas Reichel, who's expected to take another leap forward after registering 15 points in 23 games this past season. The 21-year-old was also good for nearly a point/game in the AHL. Taylor Raddysh is intriguing in deeper leagues, if he sticks on Chicago's No. 1 power play (along with you-know-who). A power play quarterbacked by the club's top fantasy defenseman, Seth Jones, who's only a season removed from punching out 51 points in 78 contests. Jones would serve nicely as a No. 2 or 3 fantasy defenseman in most scoring leagues.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever! Set your league size, select your keepers and invite your friends to start playing. Sign up for free today be the commish!\nWashington Capitals: There's still plenty of fantasy pop to appreciate on the oldest, player-age-wise, NHL team outside of Pittsburgh. Chasing Wayne Gretzky's record, Alex Ovechkin remains a top-20 fantasy forward with 50-goal potential. Currently tied with The Great One and Mike Bossy for the most 50-goal seasons (nine), Ovechkin is going to get plenty of support from his teammates in breaking that record. A recently extended Tom Wilson is fit again after losing a good part of last season to injury. The 29-year-old sports additional value in leagues that reward penalty minutes, in addition to scoring. A healthy-again John Carlson projects as a Top-15 fantasy defenseman after sitting out a hefty portion of last year with a head injury. If/when fully recovered from his latest Achilles injury, Max Pacioretty might be worth a roll of the fantasy dice in deeper leagues. If able to compete, the veteran sniper is going to score plenty. Like the Blackhawks, the Capitals play 27 on or so-determined light nights.\nArizona Coyotes: Clayton Keller, Logan Cooley, Barrett Hayton and Nick Schmaltz are, in order, my top fantasy forwards in the desert to start this regular season. Keller, who turned 25 years old in July, bested the 80-point mark for the first time this past season, potting 86, including 37 goals. Mattias Maccelli is worth monitoring if he cracks the Coyotes' top-six, while Jason Zucker merits consideration in deeper fantasy leagues. Give me Sean Durzi over J.J. Moser and Juuso Valimaki, at least at launch, as a shooting/shot-blocking defenseman with 45-point potential. Arizona plays 26 contests when only six or fewer games are scheduled, split evenly between 13 at home and 13 on the road.\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nMinnesota Wild: One of the league's most promising commodities between the pipes is also set to be more available more often than most others. In my view, Filip Gustavsson is a top-5 fantasy goalie heading into 2023-24. After posting a 22-9-7 record, .931 SV%, and 2.10 GAA through 39 games this past season, Gustavsson is now poised to play significantly more than the Wild's other netminder, Marc-Andre Fleury. Up front, Kirill Kaprizov is a full-on star, fantasy and otherwise, Matt Boldy is looking erupt for 30-plus goals after collecting 31 (and 32 assists) in his sophomore season, while Joel Eriksson Ek is hoping to prove this past year's 61-point output wasn't a fluke. Minnesota's second-line center also likes to bang bodies about and blocks more shots than your average forward. Keep rookie Marco Rossi on your fantasy radar in case the 2020 draft pick manages to climb out of Minnesota's bottom-six. When healthy, Mats Zuccarello deserves a lineup spot in most scoring leagues. Defenseman Calen Addison will pitch in upwards of 20 power-play points.\nAlong with the above-mentioned clubs, the Vegas Golden Knights, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, Colorado Avalanche, and New Jersey Devils round out the Top-10 of those who play more often when others don't. Useful info to consider, especially when debating fantasy investment in one player over another.\nThen there are those teams who play more when most everyone else is also active. On the opposite end of the busyness spectrum, the following are booked in on 15 or fewer lightly-scheduled (six or fewer) dates: Boston Bruins, New York Islanders, Ottawa Senators, Montreal Canadiens, Nashville Predators, and the aforementioned Lightning.\nReady to play?

Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nLeo Carlsson was hurt in practice this past weekend, which is a mighty shame considering he looked pretty darn good on a top line with Trevor Zegras and Troy Terry. Certainly Alex Killorn's multiple-week injury leaves some room for the Ducks to give Carlsson a try in the top six. We'll have to wait and see how severe the injury is for Carlsson.\nWith Dylan Guenther sent down to start the season, there is a little less competition for the top six in Arizona. Logan Cooley appears a lock for the No. 2 center spot, with Jason Zucker likely to be one of his wingers. But we'll have to see how high-ceilinged sophomore Matias Maccelli fits into the ranks.\nKeep an eye on 19-year-old Matthew Poitras early in the season. He seems to have won the other scoring-line center role opposite Pavel Zacha, which likely means ice time with Brad Marchand on a regular basis. Poitras has an assist-heavy portfolio in the OHL.\nP.K. Subban explains how the loss of key players such as Patrice Bergeron will hamper the Bruins this season.\nIt looks like rookie Zach Benson, the 13th overall pick, is sticking around to try the NHL as an 18-year-old. The Sabres have a lot of young talent, and a few injured players that may supplant Benson before long (Jack Quinn, Matt Savoie), but Benson will be worth a watch to see what he can do. It's likely the Sabres, at the very least, will watch for that 10-game threshold for when his entry-level deal kicks in -- but it's questionable that he would stick around if he's playing on the third or fourth line by then.\nThe sniping by Matt Coronato has been a preseason storyline for the Flames, and some hype is justified given how much flexibility remains in the top six here. Jonathan Huberdeau, Elias Lindholm and Nazem Kadri are locks, but arguments can be made for at least six other players to fill out the final three spots. Coronato has as good a shot -- both figuratively and literally -- as any of them.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever! Set your league size, select your keepers and invite your friends to start playing. Sign up for free today be the commish!\nHis minutes might not be mighty overall, but Tony DeAngelo may get some fantasy attention with the current arrangement suggesting two defenders on the Canes top power play. With DeAngelo playing his specialist role as puck distributor and Brent Burns cranking out blasts from the blue line, this could be a beneficial combo for both players.\nKevin Korchinski, a future top-pairing defender with offensive chops, will start the campaign with the Hawks as a 19-year-old. He'll be hard-pressed to pass Seth Jones on the depth chart, but there is a world where perhaps both of them end up on the advantage together with Connor Bedard, Taylor Hall and another forward. And don't sleep on Ryan Donato in deeper leagues, as he looks to have earned the spot next to Hall and Bedard on the top line.\nPerhaps getting the best opportunity of his career since he was a rookie with the Tampa Bay Lightning, Jonathan Drouin is poised to either go off like dynamite or fizzle into bottom-six permanence. The 28-year-old is skating next to two of the top-15 skaters in the world in Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen. Furthermore, if the chemistry is just right, that could eventually parlay into power-play opportunities as well.\nAn underrated offseason move is Patrik Laine moving 15 feet from the wing to lineup at center. This gives the Jackets a projected top line of Laine, Johnny Gaudreau and sniper Kirill Marchenko, rather than bumping up Boone Jenner or forcing rookie Adam Fantilli into the frying pan. This won't be the best defensive unit in the NHL (sarcasm drips), but there could be something here if Laine can mature his game defensively.\nInjuries to Roope Hintz and Wyatt Johnston mean we might not get the opening lineup we expect from the Stars. With everyone healthy, it appears Matt Duchene and Tyler Seguin would be a combo on the second line, but Seguin moves up if Hintz isn't ready to go. Johnston is also important as the third line with Jamie Benn and Evgenii Dadonov is supposed to outmatch other bottom-six combos. It also looks like Benn is keeping his top power-play specialist spot for the time being, which means fantasy value.\nMichael Rasmussen has been getting looks in the Red Wings top six all preseason. He posted a subtle 29 points in just 56 games last season and hasn't really been given looks on a scoring line before. In his age-24 campaign, a top-six role could include a breakout for Rasmussen, who was a top-10 pick by the Wings back in 2017.\nJack Campbell was a shining star in the preseason. That doesn't mean he'll rebound in the regular season and it doesn't mean Stuart Skinner will move aside, but it does give an indication that Campbell could be a value fantasy pick this season. Also note that the Connor Brown reunion with Connor McDavid went swimmingly in exhibition and Brown should be rostered universally.\nA couple names that maybe weren't expected to be there are key components of the Panthers' power play to start the season. Oliver Ekman-Larsson's redemption arc will begin with him quarterbacking the advantage to start the season, and Evan Rodrigues has looked like a mainstay on the top unit over other options like Carter Verhaeghe.\nBrandt Clarke is coming out of the preseason with a trip to the AHL, but the future remains bright for the dominant blue-liner. The final spot in the top six is still up for grabs too, as Pierre-Luc Dubois and Kevin Fiala need another winger for opening night. It might have been Arthur Kaliyev had he not been suspended for throwing knees.\nA couple under-rostered players reside here. Ryan Hartman, fresh off a payday, will be in prime position to better replicate 2021-22 (76th overall for fantasy) than last season's write-off, as he's back atop the depth chart with Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello. The power play is also due for some better luck, so Calen Addison isn't a horrible stash as the team's quarterback on the advantage in hopes he has taken some steps forward this season.\nIf Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki are the focal point of the offense, then Josh Anderson deserves some intertest to start the season. It looks like he'll be the third member of the line, spreading a Kirby Dach of offense to the second line with Alex Newhook and Juraj Slafkovsky. When the magic clicked for Anderson in the 2020-21 season, he still only finished 170th overall for fantasy, so the ceiling isn't high here.\nAt the tail end of the preseason, the Preds had one of those third-line-on-paper-but-really-the-second-line situations, with Thomas Novak, Philip Tomasino and Luke Evangelista playing together behind a second line with Cody Glass, Kiefer Sherwood and Gustav Nyquist. But Juuso Parssinen is the one to watch, having seemingly earned the role next to Ryan O'Reilly and Filip Forsberg on the top line.\nAfter teasing the idea last season, the Devils never really committed to giving Alexander Holtz a top-six look. But it sure looks like he'll start there this season after spending the entire preseason with Nico Hischier and Timo Meier. Holtz has an NHL-ready shot and this role in the lineup is a very good one.\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nWhile largely untested, the Bo Horvat-Mathew Barzal connection that is the focus of the Islanders' offensive attack is a fantastic duo on paper. Simon Holmstrom has seemingly earned first crack at making that duo into a line. There could be some fantasy value coming Holmstrom's way if he can stick with these stars -- both through virtue of expanded ice time and scoring by virtue of vicinity.\nKaapo Kakko had an inspired enough preseason to open the season on the top line with Mika Zibanejad and Chris Kreider. If things go well in the regular season, he could carry that role forward onto the top power-play unit, too, eventually replacing Vincent Trocheck there.\nWhat seemed like an easy issue headed into the season has become messy with the realization that Josh Norris is not in fact ready for the regular season. It's a strange one, as the issues were brushed off by the club at the start of camp and they seemed genuinely surprised through most reporting that Norris wouldn't be ready -- he missed most of last season with shoulder issues. It does make a mess with Shane Pinto still unsigned as a restricted free agent. Ridly Greig for No. 2 center anyone?\nThe Flyers never used the same scoring line twice in the preseason, so it's increasingly hard to gauge how some of the pieces fit. But with Sean Couturier back, the focus will be who he plays with to start. To that end, Joel Farabee should be a focus as he stuck fairly close with Couturier in a couple of games. And don't forget Cam York looks like he's earned power-play duties on the blue line.\nThough Jake Guentzel might not be out too much longer, as he's making progress to ward a return, there is one additional spot that offers a newcomer room in this top six. And Reilly Smith could have a bigger fantasy campaign than usual if he continues clicking with Evgeni Malkin and Rickard Rakell on the second line. In the meantime, Drew O'Connor likely squeezes in a couple of games with Sidney Crosby and Bryan Rust before Guentzel returns to replace him.\nSidney Crosby and Connor Bedard sit down and chat ahead of Bedard's NHL debut when the Blackhawks take on the Penguins.\nWe never did end up seeing Logan Couture in the preseason, limiting the immediately-fantasy-relevant players to just Tomas Hertl. Still, the Sharks will score some goals inevitably (right?), so there will be fringe fantasy assets to watch develop. William Eklund and Thomas Bordeleau have made the opening day roster, while Henry Thrun is making a case to be the offense from the blue line the Sharks lost with the Erik Karlsson trade. The Sharks don't play until Thursday, so we'll wait and see what their final roster moves are.\nWith much of the same balanced lineup returning for another go, there weren't many training camp battles to watch here. Shane Wright didn't make the squad and will start in the AHL. Ryker Evans, who raised eyebrows with his exhibition play on the blue line, is headed there too.\nIt looks like Kasperi Kapanen, Brayden Schenn and Brandon Saad will round out the Blues top six to start. That leaves Kevin Hayes and Jakub Vrana on the outside looking in for potential fantasy-relevant ice time.\nNo surprise that the focus here is on Andrei Vasilevskiy being out for at least two months. The preseason is just the preseason, but it would have been easy for Jonas Johansson to fold under pressure of filling Vasilevskiy's skates. But he made some big saves and likely has his team's confidence to start the season for them. There is some massive upside here if the largely untested Johansson can stay cool playing behind a quality team.\nReady to play? Sign up for free today!\nDespite lots of preseason juggling, it looks like the Leafs will open with the top-six depth chart that was predicted the moment they signed Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi. Bertuzzi gets to play alongside superstars Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner, while Domi gets a shot with John Tavares and William Nylander. Bertuzzi has been rostered in more than 80% of ESPN leagues, but Domi hasn't cracked 70% ... yet.\nElias Pettersson and Andrei Kuzmenko are a locked combination, but who joins them atop the Canucks depth chart? Anthony Beauvillier did well there at the end of last season and spent some preseason games there, but was sick for the tail end of exhibition play. Conor Garland is a coach Rick Tocchet favorite going back to Arizona, and he filled in for Beauvillier in the last preseason games. But Ilya Mikheyev may be the sleeper. He missed all the preseason recovering from an ACL injury last season, but slipped in a full practice at the end.\nNot a lot of questions circle the defending cup champs. It looks like Adin Hill gets first crack in the crease, but this could be a strict rotation with Logan Thompson still. Brett Howden might see some interest in deeper leagues if he stays with Mark Stone and Chandler Stephenson on the second line. Honestly, not much to see here from training camp battles -- which is a good thing for the defending champs to be able to say.\nJack Eichel joins the \"Monday Night Football\" set at halftime to discuss winning the Stanley Cup and playing for the Vegas Golden Knights.\nWith not a lot of exciting battles in training camp and the preseason, perhaps the biggest focus here is that Nicklas Backstrom looks like he's turned back the clock and fully recovered from his hip problems. If that's the case, he's a free agent in more than 95% of ESPN leagues and currently tied to the hip of Alex Ovechkin.\nIf the Jets do go with Mark Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Gabriel Vilardi at the top of the depth chart, it's likely trouble for Nikolaj Ehlers to try and regain the form that saw him finish top-100 for fantasy in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. But it's even more fuel for Vilardi to truly have a breakout campaign."}

{"title": "André Snellings' ultimate draft board", "date": "2023-10-10 21:23:08", "text": "Andre Snellings explains when fantasy managers should consider drafting Ja Morant, who is suspended for the first 25 games of the 2023-24 NBA season. (2:04)\nWhat do you want your team to look like?\nThis is a question that you should really ask yourself before your draft, and you should enter the draft with an answer in mind. Because the reality is, most of the people in your leagues aren't going to go into the draft with much of a plan.\nComing in prepared, with an idea about what the talent looks like at different parts of the draft, will give you a leg up on the competition right from the opening tip.\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThere are lots of ways to build a championship-caliber squad, and ultimately you'll need to come up with the strategy that works best for you. In my experience, I like the old \"practice makes perfect\" adage, so I like to do mock draft(s) before my real drafts to get a feel for what players should be available.\nWill my sleeper picks be there, or does everyone know about them so they go earlier than expected? Similarly, are there really good players that are just ranked lower than expected in the draft software and thus likely to go later than they should? Having answers to these kinds of questions before your actual draft is very valuable.\nTo that end, here's a quick look at how drafts have been shaping up so far. Utilizing Average Draft Position (ADP) data, I've gone through and looked at the types of players that are going at different spots in the draft.\nBelow are the players that have caught my eye, given their current ADP, and how I am approaching drafts.\nNote: All listed ADPs are as of Oct. 9.\nNikola Jokic (ADP 1.4) continues to be one of the easiest No. 1 overall picks we've had in fantasy basketball, having maintained that perch for three straight seasons even as he sits in the peak of his basketball prime at age 28.\nJayson Tatum (ADP 4.6) is worth strong consideration as high as No. 2 in the draft, in part because of his history of availability. While both Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic have higher per-game averages than Tatum, in the last two seasons they have averaged 65 and 65.5 games played per season, respectively. Tatum has averaged about 10 more games at 75 games per season, and the best ability is availability. Tatum also plays small forward, a position of scarcity in fantasy basketball leagues.\nAnthony Edwards (ADP 9.7) is a superstar that has developed before our eyes and appears ready to explode. He finished last season averaging 35 PPG in his last four playoff games against the Nuggets, then went on to be the unquestioned alpha on the US National Team for the FIBA World Championship. If I miss out on the top four picks, I'd be comfortable drafting Edwards anywhere else in the first round.\nTyrese Haliburton (ADP 11.2) and Trae Young (ADP 14.5) finished second and third in assists per game last season, trailing only James Harden, and with the question marks surrounding Harden this season they are in the drivers' seats to lead the league this season.\nHaliburton is still a very young player on the rise; he has taken major steps in each season so far and has already proven himself a top-10 producer on a per game basis if he can stay healthy.\nYoung is established and consistent as a top performer, and he proved last season he could produce dominant numbers even in a backcourt with another great lead guard in Dejounte Murray. Both reside in my preseason top-10 based on my most recent projections.\nLaMelo Ball (ADP 19.2) entered last season fresh off a sophomore season in which he finished with the ninth-most fantasy points in the NBA, and he projected as a top-5 producer before a series of ankle injuries derailed his season.\nBall had ankle surgery early in the offseason and is expected to return to full health. If he does, he has the chance to bounce back in a major way as the offensive engine on a Hornets team that has added talent in the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA Draft (Brandon Miller) and the return from suspension of Miles Bridges. Ball could return first-round production as a second round pick.\nAs far as other options atop the second round, Devin Booker (APD 12.1) is going in that range and has the potential for more. He showed last season, particularly in the playoffs, that his upside as the point/lead guard for the Suns resembles MVP James Harden from the Rockets days: Booker averaged 33.7 PPG, 7.2 APG, 4.8 RPG, 2.8 3PG, 1.7 SPG and 0.8 BPG in 11 playoffs games played with Kevin Durant last season.\nHis projections for this season are more conservative than that, since he won't be playing 41.7 MPG in the regular season and the addition of Bradley Beal could limit his volume, but Booker has that kind of ability and, at age 27, could be on the verge of turning in a transcendent peak season.\nDejounte Murray (ADP 25.1) maintained elite production last season even playing next to Young in Atlanta. He's also a relative iron man since missing the 2018-19 campaign, having missed eight or fewer games in three of the last four seasons. There are also consistent rumblings about whether Young will remain with the Hawks the entire season, and if Young were to be moved it could be a big boost for Murray's production.\nJalen Brunson (26.4) was in this article last season as he went from a backup position with the Mavericks to the starting job with the Knicks. If anything, he outperformed expectations in his first season in New York, and comes into this season with even higher projections. Brunson has averaged 27.8 PPG (51.7 FG%, 45.6 3P%), 5.8 APG and 2.4 3PG in 34 games in calendar year 2023, and if those numbers are a baseline for this season it would outperform his current ADP.\nJordan Poole (ADP 27.3) has put up big numbers the last two seasons when called upon to start and lead the team with Stephen Curry injured. He did this on a Warriors team that, even without Curry, had structure and expectations. Poole will now be in the lead role for a Wizards team where he should have the ultimate green light and every chance to generate large numbers of points, assists and 3-pointers. He currently sits at 14th in projected fantasy points this season.\nMikal Bridges (ADP 29.0) transitioned from an elite 3-and-D forward to a primary high-volume scorer when he was traded to the Nets last season. If he maintains the numbers he generated with the Nets in the last portion of the campaign, mixed in with his status as the iron man of the NBA (he played in 83 games last season!), Bridges could return first-round overall production from a third round pick.\nZion Williamson (ADP 33.7) is one of the biggest risk/reward players in the draft. He projects to be seventh in fantasy points per game this season, but has missed 135 of the last 162 Pelicans games due to injury. As a fourth round pick, he could be a league-winning pick and the risk is mitigated a bit with three other high-round picks already in the fold.\nNikola Vucevic (ADP 33.7) is a non-sexy pick that just produces like a metronome every year. In two full seasons with the Bulls, he has averaged exactly 17.6 PPG, exactly 11.0 RPG and exactly 3.2 APG while playing in 155 out of 162 games. You know what you're getting from Vucevic, and with his high projected game totals that could be second-round value from a fourth round fantasy hoops pick.\nJosh Giddey (ADP 50.7) and teammate Jalen Williams (ADP 81.4) both project to outperform their ADPs. Giddy flirts with a triple-double on a nightly basis as the floor general for the Thunder, and Williams is fresh off a First Team All Rookie first season with upside to improve in season two.\nScottie Barnes (ADP 54.6) had a slow start to his sophomore campaign as the then-reigning Rookie of the Year, but finished the season strong and should have more on-ball responsibility for the Raptors this season with Fred VanVleet no longer running the point. He projects to early fourth-round value.\nAlperen Sengun (ADP 63.1) and Jalen Green (ADP 78.8) are another set of teammates set to outperform their ADPs, both entering magical season three. Sengun took over the starting center job early last season and got better over time, averaging 15.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.8 APG, 1.1 SPG and 1.0 BPG in his last 36 games. Green also finished the season in impressive fashion, averaging 23.2 PPG in his last 36 outings. Sengun projects to a top-50, and Green to a top-60 fantasy producer this season.\nJa Morant (ADP 81.8) is suspended for the first 25 games of the season, and he wouldn't be eligible for the injured list so he would be eating a roster spot. With that said, he projects to 22nd in per-game production, and being able to stash that to have for the final two-thirds of the season could be worth the roster spot in the mid-to-late rounds of your fantasy hoops draft.\nTyus Jones (ADP 91.2) has spent the last few seasons backing up Morant, but each time he has been given the chance to start for extended periods he has put up numbers. Last season, in 22 starts in place of Morant, he averaged 16.4 PPG, 8.1 APG, 4.0 RPG, 2.0 3PG and 1.8 SPG while shooting 50.0 percent from the field. If he can replicate those numbers in his new situation with the Wizards, Jones could return top-50 fantasy basketball value.\nOther players with late-round ADPs that project to top-100 fantasy value this season:\nTre Jones (ADP 80.8; projected fantasy points (PFP) 61st)\nKeegan Murray (ADP 88.8, PFP 61)\nJakob Poeltl (ADP 90.3, PFP 69)\nBuddy Hield (ADP 101.3, PFP 76th)\nKevin Huerter (ADP 101.3, PFP 81st)\nDaniel Gafford (ADP 118.4, PFP 82nd)\nJabari Smith Jr. (ADP 117.1, PFP 97th)\nShaedon Sharpe (ADP 112, PFP 99th)\nThere are three players that were once fantasy hoops stars that are working their way back after extended absences and are currently going either undrafted or being picked in the last round: Ben Simmons, Miles Bridges and Jonathan Isaac. Note: Bridges can't play in the preseason and is suspended for the first 10 games of the regular season.\nAll are very risky plays, particularly Simmons and Isaac, but all three have seasons with easy top-50 fantasy hoops per-game production in their past and could be league winners if they return to form."}

Where did MVP contenders such as Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and reigning winner Joel Embiid check in?\nWhere did LeBron James land as he enters season No. 21?\nTo get the final NBArank prediction, we asked our expert panel to vote on player vs. player matchups from more than 15,000 possible pairings. Voters were asked, \"Which player will be better in 2023-24?\" and had to predict how each player will perform this season.\nOur countdown kicks off with our rankings of players Nos. 100-51, which include star guards, elite rim protectors and plenty of faces in new places.\nNote: ESPN's NBArank panel, composed of nearly 150 reporters, editors, producers and analysts, were asked to rank players based on their predicted contributions -- quality and quantity -- for the 2023-24 season only.\nNew York Knicks | C\n2022 NBArank: 98\nSwing skill: Robinson is an elite offensive rebounder, providing the Knicks with plenty of second-chance opportunities. His 4.5 offensive boards per game last season were the second highest in the league, behind Memphis Grizzlies center Steven Adams. That, paired with Robinson's 67.1% field goal percentage thanks to a plethora of dunks, makes him exactly the kind of big man coach Tom Thibodeau looks for.\n-- Tim Bontemps\nNew Orleans Pelicans | C\n2022 NBArank: 84\nSwing skill: Valanciunas saw a significant drop in his minutes last season (30.3 to 24.9), but he remained one of the league's premier rebounders. He led all qualified players in rebound percentage (20.4%) and averaged 14.1 points and 10.2 rebounds last season -- the sixth time in NBA history a player averaged a double-double in under 25 minutes per game.\n-- Andrew Lopez\nUtah Jazz | PG\n2022 NBArank: NR\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  Can Sexton convince Jazz management he should be considered part of the franchise's long-term foundation? He hasn't been on Utah's short list of players who were off-limits in trade discussions. The vision for Sexton in Utah is him being a sixth man who provides scoring punch, not the go-to guy he was for losing teams in Cleveland before suffering a knee injury.\n-- Tim MacMahon\nDallas Mavericks | PF\n2022 NBArank: 99\nNew face in new place:  Dallas prioritized defense, intelligence and toughness last offseason, which is why they deemed Williams worthy of a four-year, $54 million contract and gave up 2030 first-round swap rights in a three-team sign-and-trade deal. He joins stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving as the three players who are locks for Dallas' starting lineup.\n-- MacMahon\nSacramento Kings | PF\n2022 NBArank: 74\n• Nos. 100-51: Where's Zion?\n• Pelton: The next wave is coming\n• Coming Wednesday: Nos. 50-11\n• Coming Thursday: Nos. 10-1\nOne huge question for 2023-24: What will his role be this season? Barnes signed a three-year, $54 million extension over the summer, and on a younger team looking to continue its rise, he is a trusted veteran voice for reigning Coach of the Year Mike Brown. However, Barnes' minutes declined last year, and the addition of EuroLeague MVP Sasha Vezenkov could impact the way Sacramento uses Barnes in 2023-24.\n-- Kendra Andrews\nOklahoma City Thunder | F\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Williams was one of the best surprises from last year's rookie class. He averaged 14.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game, shooting 52.1% overall and 35.6% from 3. There's no reason to believe he can't take another step forward.\n-- Ohm Youngmisuk\nLA Clippers | PG\n2022 NBArank: 65\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Westbrook proved his doubters wrong after finding a new home with the Clippers. (The Clippers don't win Game 1 at Phoenix without Westbrook's impactful plays.) After his ill-fitting tenure with the Lakers, Russ has a full training camp and season to facilitate for Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\n-- Youngmisuk\nMinnesota Timberwolves | PG\n2022 NBArank: 89\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  Can Conley help solve the offensive puzzle with the Timberwolves' big men? Minnesota needs savvy point guard play if the combination of Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert is going to click on the offensive end. Conley didn't get much time to work with the tandem after arriving in a trade last season, as the trio played only 124 minutes together during the regular season.\n-- MacMahon\nNew York Knicks | SG\n2022 NBArank: NR\nOne huge question for 2023-24: What is his future in New York? Quickley was a finalist for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year last season, but his contract status will be worth watching over the next few weeks. If he and the Knicks can't come to an agreement on a contract extension between now and the start of the regular season, Quickley's name will come up in trade talks.\n-- Bontemps\nNew York Knicks | SG\n2022 NBArank: NR\nSwing skill: Hart's energy proved to be a difference-maker for the Knicks last season when he came over in a trade deadline acquisition from Portland, partnering with Quickley to revitalize New York's second unit. The Knicks outscored teams by a staggering 11.9 points per 100 possessions in Hart's 750 regular-season minutes on the court after the trade deadline last year.\n-- Bontemps\nUtah Jazz | PF\n2022 NBArank: 73\nNew face in new place: Collins, finally traded after years of rumors, should benefit from a change in scenery after posting career lows in field goal percentage (.508) and 3-point percentage (.292) in 2022-23. Getting Collins back to his career averages (.551 and .356) would be a boost for Utah.\n-- Lopez\nPortland Trail Blazers | C\n2022 NBArank: 58\nOne huge question for 2023-24: After being traded to Portland in the Jrue Holiday trade, the question hovering over Williams now is: What exactly, does his future look like in Portland? Perhaps the Trail Blazers will attempt to play him alongside Deandre Ayton, whom they also acquired as part of the Damian Lillard trade. What's more likely is Williams coming off the bench, which at least leaves open the possibility Portland will try to turn the defensive force into more future assets sometime this season or beyond.\n-- Bontemps\nGolden State Warriors | C\n2022 NBArank: NR\nSwing skill: As the Warriors' lone true center, Looney has to be dominant on the boards, which he has been for Golden State over the past two seasons. Looney led the league in offensive rebounds during the regular season (274), and the Warriors scored a league-best 349 points off the second-chance opportunities he created.\n-- Andrews\nIndiana Pacers | SG\n2022 NBArank: 90\nOne huge question for 2023-24: Will Hield finish the season with Indiana? He is entering the final season of his contract with the Pacers after joining the team during the 2021-22 season in the Tyrese Haliburton trade. But Hield could be a valuable addition to a contender. Over the past five seasons, no one in the league has made more 3-pointers.\n-- Jamal Collier\nWashington Wizards | PF\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Kuzma made strides last season, averaging 21.2 points, 7.2 rebounds and a career-high 3.7 assists. Now that Bradley Beal and Kristaps Porzingis have been traded, the Wizards will lean on Kuz even more. While they also added Jordan Poole, Kuzma's scoring load should only increase.\n-- Youngmisuk\nPortland Trail Blazers | SG\n2022 NBArank: 91\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Any time former teammate Damian Lillard was out of the lineup, Simons put up Lillard-like numbers. He averaged 22.0 PPG and 5.5 APG in the 30 games Lillard missed in 2021-22, then boosted that to 27.9 PPG and 5.7 APG in 11 such games last season.\n-- Kevin Pelton\nAtlanta Hawks | C\n2022 NBArank: 79\nSwing skill:  Capela remains one of the league's top offensive rebounders. He has finished top three in offensive rebounds in each of the past three seasons and is the only player with at least 250 offensive boards in each of those campaigns. Also, in 19 games under coach Quin Snyder, Capela's offensive efficiency took a jump; he shot 73.0% over that stretch on 7.2 attempts a game.\n-- Lopez\nPhiladelphia 76ers | SF\n2022 NBArank: 56\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Harris hasn't always had it easy in Philadelphia, but he has now been with the 76ers for 4½ seasons and has admirably filled whatever role asked of him. With coach Nick Nurse in charge and James Harden's future in question, Harris could get more opportunities to have an impact on offense, something that was not often available to him last year, when he averaged fewer points (14.7) than he had in any season since he played for Orlando and Detroit in 2015-16.\n-- Bontemps\nBrooklyn Nets | SF\n2022 NBArank: NR\nElite skill:  Johnson was rewarded with a four-year deal worth up to $108 million by the Nets, who acquired him in the Kevin Durant trade, because of his prolific and accurate 3-point shooting. Among players with at least 500 attempts over the past two seasons, Johnson's 42% 3-point shooting ranks fifth.\n-- Pelton\nMilwaukee Bucks | F\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Portis has been a consistent reserve for Milwaukee the past few seasons, but perhaps this is the year he captures Sixth Man of the Year? The Bucks shipped away some of their depth to acquire Damian Lillard, which means they could lean on Portis even more off the bench.\n-- Collier\nHouston Rockets | SG\n2022 NBArank: 62\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Green has displayed the potential to be a premier scorer, averaging 22.1 points per game in his age-20 season a year ago. With the arrival of Fred VanVleet, Green will play alongside a true point guard for the first time in his career, which should help boost his efficiency.\n-- MacMahon\nMiami Heat | PG\n2022 NBArank: 61\nOne game to watch this season:  Feb. 27 at Portland. The much-discussed deal for Damian Lillard never materialized this offseason as the Trail Blazers sought out something more than what the Heat could offer. Herro's name was thrown out in trade talks, but Portland ultimately went another way. Herro might want to show out in his first chance against the Blazers.\n-- Lopez\nPortland Trail Blazers | PG\n2022 NBArank: NR (Rookie)\nOne game to watch this season:  Dec. 28 vs. San Antonio. The Victor Wembanyama-Scoot rematch at NBA summer league was scuttled by a minor shoulder injury Henderson suffered in his Blazers debut, making this the first head-to-head meeting between two of the top three picks in the draft since their October 2022 exhibition matchups.\n-- Pelton\nUtah Jazz | PG\n2022 NBArank: 85\nFriday, Oct. 13\nWarriors at Lakers, 10 p.m. (ESPN2)\nSunday, Oct. 15\nBucks at Lakers, 7 p.m.\nWarriors at Kings, 9:30 p.m.\nAll times Eastern\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  Does Clarkson stay in the starting lineup? Clarkson, the 2020-21 Sixth Man of the Year, has a claim to be the best bench scorer in NBA history. In fact, his career average of 15.2 points per game off the bench is the highest for any player since the ABA-NBA merger, according to ESPN Stats & Information research, but he thrived in his return to a starting role last season, averaging career bests of 20.8 points and 4.4 assists per game. His long-term role likely depends in part on the development of Utah's young guards.\n-- MacMahon\nGolden State Warriors | PG\n2022 NBArank: 21\nNew face in a new place: Will anyone ever get used to seeing Paul in a Warriors jersey? Maybe not. Beyond the strangeness of him in the uniform, it will be interesting to see how Paul fits. Will he start? How will he and Draymond Green coexist? How will he impact the play of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson?\n-- Andrews\nChicago Bulls | C\n2022 NBArank: 57\nOne game to watch this season:  Nov. 4 at Denver. \"There is something really cool about the name Nikola,\" Vucevic posted on X shortly after the Denver Nuggets and Nikola Jokic won the NBA championship. The two big men are friends, but Vucevic brought something extra when the two matched up last year, putting up 25 points and 15 rebounds in a Bulls win in Denver.\n-- Collier\nDetroit Pistons | PG\n2022 NBArank: 35\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24:  Cunningham's fall in the rankings comes after he played 12 games during the 2022-23 season because of injury. His season got derailed before his sophomore season ever really got started. If he can build off his rookie season, Cunningham should rise in the rankings next season.\n-- Collier\nOklahoma City Thunder | PF\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Holmgren could be a huge difference-maker for the Thunder. His potential to impact the game on both ends of the floor with his height and length is tantalizing. If Holmgren can make shots and erase them on the other end -- and isn't pushed around by stronger bigs -- he could certainly exceed this ranking.\n-- Youngmisuk\nWashington Wizards | SG\n2022 NBArank: 55\nOne game to watch this season: Dec. 22 at Golden State. Poole will face his old team for the first time since he was traded for Chris Paul in January -- and at his old stomping grounds, no less. Even if he doesn't admit there is extra motivation for him in this game, it will be an opportunity for Poole to show how he can be the offensive focal point on a team.\n-- Andrews\nNew York Knicks | SG\n2022 NBArank: 63\nSwing skill: Barrett shot 40% from 3-point range in his second NBA season. His percentages in his other three seasons with the Knicks, though, are underwhelming: 32%, 34% and 31% last season. The difference between Barrett being an adequate player and one who can be a real impact player is him becoming a league-average-or-better 3-point shooter.\n-- Bontemps\nUtah Jazz | C\n2022 NBArank: NR\nSwing skill: \"The Sheriff\" instantly established himself as one of the NBA's best rim protectors. He ranked fourth in the league in blocked shots (2.3 per game) as a rookie despite not starting until midseason. Opponents shot only 51.5% inside of six feet against the 7-foot-1 Kessler, according to NBA Advanced Stats. Only Defensive Player of the Year Jaren Jackson Jr. was stingier among the 102 players who challenged at least 300 shots within that close range.\n-- MacMahon\nMilwaukee Bucks | C\n2022 NBArank: NR\nSwing skill:  The Bucks' perimeter defense will be less sturdy this year without Jrue Holiday, which makes Lopez's shot-blocking and rim protection even more important this season. He was excellent last season defending the rim, with a league-leading 193 blocks and 1,225 contested 2-point shots. (Brooklyn's Nic Claxton contested the second-most shots ... with 700).\n-- Collier\nDenver Nuggets | SF\n2022 NBArank: 72\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  Porter struggled with his shot in the NBA Finals, shooting just 14.3% from behind the arc, but he did come up big in the Nuggets' title-clincher with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Understanding what it takes to win a title, can Porter improve defensively and find ways to impact games when his shot isn't falling, like he did in Game 5? Coach Michael Malone hopes so.\n-- Youngmisuk\nToronto Raptors | SF\n2022 NBArank: 75\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Win projections for 30 teams\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nSwing skill: Anunoby is an elite defensive player, strong and skilled enough at that end to guard virtually any player or position. What goes unnoticed at times, however, is that he's become a very dependable 3-point shooter, hitting more than 38% on more than six attempts per game over the past three seasons. If Anunoby keeps that up, he's going to be in for a massive payday next summer -- either in Toronto or elsewhere.\n-- Bontemps\nLos Angeles Lakers | SG\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24:  USA Basketball did not medal in the World Cup over the summer, but Reaves showed how he thrives in an iron-sharpens-iron environment. Reaves was Team USA's second-leading scorer on 57/50/95 shooting splits while ranking third in assists and third in steals. We've seen plenty of players parlay stars-and-stripes service into a leap the following season -- Reaves could be the next name on that list.\n-- Dave McMenamin\nIndiana Pacers | C\n2022 NBArank: 66\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  After signing a two-year contract extension in January, Turner is finally free from the constant trade speculation that has swirled around his name for years. Coming off one of his best and healthiest seasons -- 18.0 PPG and 7.5 RPG in 62 games -- how does Indiana's longest-tenured player factor into the team's future next to Tyrese Haliburton?\n-- Collier\nMinnesota Timberwolves | C\n2022 NBArank: 18\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  Can Gobert fit alongside Karl-Anthony Towns? The calf injury suffered by Towns last season prevented the Timberwolves from getting a large-enough sample size to provide a definitive answer, but the limited results weren't encouraging. Minnesota averaged only 106.2 points per 100 possessions in the 529 minutes the two big men played together. (The league-worst Charlotte Hornets offense checked in at 108.4 last season.)\n-- MacMahon\nToronto Raptors | SF\n2022 NBArank: 39\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  Will the real Scottie Barnes please stand up? After an impressive debut season culminated with the NBA's Rookie of the Year award, Barnes struggled to replicate that success as a sophomore. As Toronto adjusts to a new era after Fred VanVleet left in free agency and Darko Rajakovic replaced Nick Nurse as the team's coach, whether Barnes can take a leap forward this season is arguably the biggest question facing the franchise in 2023-24.\n-- Bontemps\nBoston Celtics | C\n2022 NBArank: 86\nOne huge question for 2023-24: How will he handle heightened expectations? There have been few more fascinating trades in recent memory than the Porzingis-Marcus Smart swap this summer, a move that completely remakes the identity of the Celtics, who have more playoff wins than any team but the Golden State Warriors since the start of the 2016-17 season. Porzingis, who only has 10 playoff games in his entire career, will now be judged on how he performs next spring.\n-- Bontemps\nMemphis Grizzlies | SG\n2022 NBArank: 68\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Elite shooters whose games are as well-rounded as Bane's are hard to find. He joined Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant as the only players in the league to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists while shooting better than 40% from 3-point range. It's a good bet that Bane, 25, will keep getting better. His scoring, rebound and assist averages have increased significantly each season.\n-- MacMahon\nAtlanta Hawks | SG\n2022 NBArank: 42\nSwing skill: Despite a drop in his steals per game and steal percentage a year ago, Murray still proved to be one of the NBA's leaders in thievery. Murray, who led the NBA in steals in 2021-22, is the only player in the NBA to have at least 100 steals in each of the past four seasons.\n-- Lopez\nMemphis Grizzlies | PG\n2022 NBArank: 34\nOne game to watch this season: Feb. 4 at Boston. This will be a day to remember inside TD Garden, where one of the most beloved players in recent Celtics history will make his return. It will be a guaranteed lovefest for No. 36, who had been the heart and soul of the Celtics for the past nine years.\n-- Bontemps\nPortland Trail Blazers | SF\n2022 NBArank: 64\nOne huge question for 2023-24:  How does Grant fit on a rebuilding Blazers team? His new five-year, $160 million deal -- the most total money of any free agent -- was announced as Damian Lillard was asking out. At 29, Grant is now nearly three years older than any other starter on the Blazers.\n-- Pelton\nNew Orleans Pelicans | PF\n2022 NBArank: 40\nOne huge question for 2023-24: It has seemingly been a big question for Williamson throughout his career: Can he stay healthy? The Pelicans forward's drop in the rankings is directly tied to his games played. He played 29 games last season and has played more than 30 just once in his four-year career.\n-- Lopez\nHouston Rockets | PG\n2022 NBArank: 38\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nNew face in new place:  The Rockets recruited VanVleet to be the leader of what they're referring to as Phase 2 of the franchise's rebuild, signing the point guard who averaged 19.3 points and 7.3 assists per game for Toronto last season to a three-year, $130 million deal. The expectation is VanVleet will instill structure and toughness while providing Houston's young players a role model for professionalism.\n-- MacMahon\nGolden State Warriors | PF\n2022 NBArank: 43\nOne huge question for 2023-24: As the fallout from him punching Jordan Poole followed the Warriors all season, Green admitted he didn't feel he could be the vocal, and sometimes abrasive, leader the Warriors needed him to be. Green said he couldn't hold his teammates accountable, which in part led to defensive issues and wild home-road splits. For the Warriors to rebound this year, they need Green to be the leader he always has been -- without crossing the line while doing so.\n-- Andrews\nGolden State Warriors | SF\n2022 NBArank: 32\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24: Last season was the toughest year for Wiggins since he arrived in Golden State around the trade deadline in 2020. Between injuries and a family matter, Wiggins missed a total of 45 games and could never find the consistency that made him such a crucial part of the Warriors' title run in 2022. As long as he's able to find a rhythm, he should be a top-50 player in the league.\n-- Andrews\nOklahoma City Thunder | SG\n2022 NBArank: 81\nOne huge question for 2023-24: The Thunder are expected to take a leap forward this season. If so, Giddey will have to take another one himself. The point guard is entering his third season after finishing 2022-23 strong, averaging 20.2 points, 6.7 assists, 9.1 rebounds in his final eight games. But can Giddey show big improvement in his shooting after averaging 48.2% from the field and 32.5% from 3?\n-- Youngmisuk\nOrlando Magic | SF\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he could exceed his ranking in 2023-24:  A strong summer performance could be something Wagner builds on after helping Germany to the FIBA World Cup championship. Wagner, who was on the World Cup's All-Tournament second team, averaged 18.6 points in his sophomore campaign last year for an Orlando squad that went 29-28 after a 5-20 start.\n-- Lopez\nDenver Nuggets | PF\n2022 NBArank: 83\nOne huge question for 2023-24: Often overshadowed by Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, Gordon finished the Finals with a plus-61 plus/minus, tied for seventh best since the start of play-by-play tracking (1996-97). With key player Bruce Brown gone, could Gordon see an uptick in opportunities? Gordon showed what he can do when he is a focal point, with 27 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists in Game 4 of the Finals against Miami.\n-- Youngmisuk"}
{"title": "Week 6 NFL Power Rankings: 1-32 poll, plus fantasy surprises", "date": "2023-10-10 23:48:36", "text": "Herm Edwards and Booger McFarland pick the NFL teams that rose the most in their Power Rankings. (1:03)\nWelcome to Week 6 of the 2023 NFL season. Two teams -- the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles -- remain undefeated, while the Carolina Panthers still haven't tracked down their first win.\nAfter blowing out the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night, the 49ers are the clear No. 1 team in this week's NFL Power Rankings. And the 4-1 Detroit Lions are quietly approaching the top five. The New England Patriots are in real trouble and have sunk in the rankings, while Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals are trying to climb their way out of the bottom half after showing some life Sunday.\nBelow we've updated the rankings, 1-32, and our NFL Nation reporters are taking a look at every team's fantasy football surprise (good or bad) so far this season. Which players -- like Brock Purdy and De'Von Achane -- have exceeded expectations on the field (and in fantasy)? And who is off to a rough start and should be sitting on a fantasy manager's bench? Let's find out.\nHere are the updated rankings, starting with the aforementioned 49ers.\nOur power panel of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities evaluates how NFL teams stack up against each other, then ranks them from 1 to 32.\nPrevious rankings: Preseason | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5\nJump to a team:\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\nWeek 5 ranking: 1\nFantasy surprise: QB Brock Purdy\nIt's hard to call this a surprise given how Purdy played down the stretch last season, but he has posted the fifth most fantasy points by a quarterback this season -- ahead of Patrick Mahomes! He's even scored a pair of rushing touchdowns. The only real knock on Purdy fantasywise is that he and the Niners have made such a habit of jumping all over their opponents that he hasn't had many opportunities to compile big numbers for all four quarters. -- Nick Wagoner\nThe \"Fantasy Focus\" crew breaks down what Brock Purdy's performance this season means for his fantasy stock.\nWeek 5 ranking: 2\nFantasy surprise: TE Dallas Goedert\nGoedert had just 88 receiving yards and no touchdowns through the first four weeks. He was looking like a bust until he broke out against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, racking up 117 yards and a touchdown on eight catches. Working alongside A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, a steady stream of targets can be hard to come by, but Sunday's performance reinforced that Goedert is a playmaker who should be utilized, particularly in the red zone. -- Tim McManus\nWeek 5 ranking: 4\nFantasy surprise: WR Rashee Rice\nThe rookie leads the Chiefs' wide receivers in catches (17), targets (24) and touchdowns (2). He would be doing better had he not dropped several passes. Despite that, he's been a more consistent producer than any of the team's veteran wide receivers. He should only continue to become more a part of the passing game as he gains more experience. -- Adam Teicher\nWeek 5 ranking: 6\nFantasy surprise: RB De'Von Achane\nThe rookie has been a revelation for the Dolphins on the field and for fantasy managers off it. He has recorded three-straight games of 100-plus rushing yards and at least one touchdown, despite splitting carries with Raheem Mostert. His game-breaking speed is reminiscent of Chris Johnson and he's been good for at least one explosive run every week. On Monday, however, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Achane is dealing with a knee injury and will be further evaluated over the next couple of days. So his status is something for fantasy managers to keep an eye on. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nDaniel Dopp explains why he feels better about Trevor Lawrence in fantasy after his game vs. the Bills.\nWeek 5 ranking: 8\nFantasy surprise: WR Josh Reynolds\nReynolds has quietly been one of the steadiest offensive weapons for the Lions, with the second most receiving yards (291) and third-most targets (24) through the first five games. He also has three receiving touchdowns, and the connection with Lions QB Jared Goff dates back to their early years of playing together for the Rams. More notable names like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs -- and even Goff -- were top fantasy picks for Detroit entering the year, but Reynolds has certainly started strong. -- Eric Woodyard\nWeek 5 ranking: 3\nFantasy surprise: Defense/Special teams\nThe Bills' defense was set up to be good, but the second highest fantasy points through five weeks (60.0)? That's better than good. Buffalo leads the league in sacks (21) and takeaways (13). This was a unit that was expected to be a productive defense, and while there are now a number of injuries to deal with, it's been an impressive start with Von Miller now being integrated in and Sean McDermott calling plays for his first time as head coach. -- Alaina Getzenberg\nWeek 5 ranking: 5\nFantasy surprise: WR Brandin Cooks\nWith the way things went in training camp, Cooks looked like he was going to be a huge factor in the passing game. So far, it hasn't happened. He has nine catches for 73 yards in four games and missed one game with a knee injury. The Cowboys have not gotten the deep passing game going yet, either, because of blowout wins when they scaled back the attack, questions about pass protection or just sheer ineffectiveness. His 8.1 yards per catch would be a career low since averaging 10.4 yards per catch as a rookie in 2014. -- Todd Archer\nWeek 5 ranking: 10\nFantasy surprise: WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba\nAs a rookie receiver playing behind Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf in a run-heavy offense, Smith-Njigba wasn't expected to be a fantasy stud right away. But anyone who watched the 20th overall pick shine in practice over the offseason would have anticipated more than 12 catches for 62 yards over his first four games. He's been targeted 20 times -- only three fewer than Metcalf -- so it hasn't been as simple as the ball just not going his way. Part of the issue has been the trickle-down effect of the Seahawks' O-line injuries. It has forced them to rely on formations with multiple tight ends in order to help out their backup tackles in pass protection, which has taken Smith-Njigba off the field. -- Brady Henderson\nWeek 5 ranking: 9\nFantasy surprise: Defense/Special teams\nThe Buccaneers' 10.5 defensive fantasy points per game mark is fourth best in the league. Last season, they averaged 5.76 defensive fantasy points per game (17th). They've been a stingy defense under Todd Bowles, but the takeaways have eluded them until now. They're averaging 3.0 sacks a game (eighth). They're also only giving up 17 points per game, a credit to their work in the red zone as opposing teams have just a 27.3% red zone efficiency against them -- second best in the league. -- Jenna Laine\nWeek 5 ranking: 13\nFantasy surprise: QB Trevor Lawrence\nLawrence hasn't played badly, but he hasn't gotten off to the hot start as expected, with only five touchdown passes despite the addition of WR Calvin Ridley to Jacksonville's corps. Lawrence had his best game last Sunday against the Bills, throwing for 315 yards and a touchdown, but ranks behind C.J. Stroud, Jordan Love, Sam Howell and Joshua Dobbs in fantasy points among QBs. -- Michael DiRocco\nField Yates advises fantasy managers to hold Zack Moss after his big game in Week 5, even with Jonathan Taylor back for the Colts.\nWeek 5 ranking: 7\nFantasy surprise: WR Odell Beckham Jr.\nBeckham missed two games with an ankle injury and hasn't been productive when he's been on the field. He is averaging a career-low 4.9 fantasy points per game this season. Beckham was a fantasy must-have from 2014 to 2020, when he averaged double digits per game in each of those seasons. His previous career low was 9.2 points per game, which was in 2021. Lamar Jackson's favorite target at wide receiver has been rookie Zay Flowers, and it doesn't look like that will change. -- Jamison Hensley\nWeek 5 ranking: 11\nFantasy surprise: Defense/Special teams\nThe Browns are No. 1 in defensive efficiency. They're giving up just 15 points per game (No. 2 in the NFL) and they lead the league in third-down defense (22.6% opponent conversion rate). Curiously, the Browns have forced only three turnovers, with only one interception. But with coordinator Jim Schwartz's aggressive style and Defensive Player of the Year candidate Myles Garrett leading the pass rush, the turnovers should come in time. The Browns have the 8th-easiest remaining schedule, which means they could feast on the opposition the rest of the year. -- Jake Trotter\nWeek 5 ranking: 12\nFantasy surprise: WR Keenan Allen\nThrough the first five weeks -- including a bye week for the Chargers -- Allen has the seventh most fantasy points in PPR leagues of any receiver, ahead of other top receivers, including A.J. Brown of the Philadelphia Eagles and Davante Adams of the Las Vegas Raiders. Allen's best game came in Week 3, where he broke franchise and league records, catching 18 passes for 215 yards and throwing a 40-yard touchdown pass in a win over the Minnesota Vikings. -- Kris Rhim\nWeek 5 ranking: 18\nFantasy surprise: TE Juwan Johnson\nJohnson seemed like he was on the verge of a breakout fantasy season after finishing 15th in points in ESPN leagues for his position. His rapport with Derek Carr in training camp certainly indicated he could be a big part of the offense, but so far he has only seven receptions for 61 yards and has missed the last two games with an injury. He hasn't been a \"go-to\" option for this team with Michael Thomas, Rashid Shaheed, Alvin Kamara and Chris Olave taking the majority of the targets. -- Katherine Terrell\nWeek 5 ranking: 19\nFantasy surprise: RB Najee Harris\nThe Steelers' offense has underperformed on the field and on fantasy rosters, but fantasy managers are perhaps the most disappointed in Harris. Drafted as the RB11 in PPR and standard ESPN leagues, Harris is RB32 in standard and RB38 in PPR entering Monday night's game. The Steelers are one of only two teams without a rushing touchdown, and Harris is averaging just 49 yards per game. After being the Steelers' primary three-down back in his first two seasons, Harris is more evenly splitting the load with Jaylen Warren through five games. Warren was drafted as the RB45 in PPR and RB43 in standard but is RB23 in PPR and RB31 in standard through five games. -- Brooke Pryor\nWeek 5 ranking: 22\nFantasy surprise: TE Kyle Pitts\nPitts was off to a rough start (as was the entire Atlanta offense not named Bijan Robinson) in fantasy, with fewer than five fantasy points in two of the first four weeks. So, that's been a disappointment for those who manage Pitts. But a reason to believe might be on the horizon. Pitts had seven catches for 87 yards (on 11 targets) in Week 5 and looked more like his 2021 form, where he had over 1,000 yards receiving and was a Pro Bowler. -- Michael Rothstein\nWeek 5 ranking: 17\nFantasy surprise: RB Zack Moss\nHis usage figured to be higher than expected once it became clear Jonathan Taylor would not be ready to start the season. But few could have predicted Moss would break out the way he has, averaging 111.3 rushing yards and scoring four total touchdowns. And because Moss has had such a hot start, he'll likely continue to get his share of touches even though Taylor has now returned to the lineup. -- Stephen Holder\nField Yates, Liz Loza and Daniel Dopp are all in agreement that Puka Nacua will continue to produce for fantasy managers even with Cooper Kupp's return from injury.\nWeek 5 ranking: 25\nFantasy surprise: WR Tee Higgins\nEven before the Bengals' wide receiver left the Week 4 loss with a fractured rib, Higgins' production was not at his usual level. In four games he had just 12 catches for 129 yards and two touchdowns. And that was despite having 30 targets before he suffered the injury. Higgins racked up a combined 3,000 yards in his first three seasons and has produced at a WR1 level at times. Once healthy, he'll be looking to bounce back to help the Bengals and show why he's worth a long-term contract in the coming years. -- Ben Baby\nWeek 5 ranking: 14\nFantasy surprise: RB AJ Dillon\nThis should've been Dillon's time to shine, with Aaron Jones dealing with a hamstring injury that has significantly limited his playing time. But through the first month of the season, Dillon hasn't delivered. He has averaged just 2.8 yards per carry in the first five games of the season. On Monday night, Dillon showed improvement, registering his first touchdown of the season. -- Rob Demovsky\nWeek 5 ranking: 15\nFantasy surprise: WR Puka Nacua\nThis is an easy answer for the Rams, as Nacua may be one of the biggest fantasy surprises around the league. The fifth-round pick took advantage of Cooper Kupp's absence in the first four games and has averaged 23.9 fantasy points per game, which is tied for seventh in the NFL. Even better news for Nacua? In Kupp's return, he still had six catches for 57 yards and a touchdown. -- Sarah Barshop\nEric Moody gives his recommendation for fantasy managers looking to trade Alexander Mattison before Week 6.\nWeek 5 ranking: 16\nFantasy surprise: WR Terry McLaurin\nMcLaurin remains a very good receiver; the opportunities have changed, however. He's averaging career lows in targets per game (6.5), yards per catch (10.4), yards after the catch (2.52) and also in percentage of catches for 20-plus yards (12). He is catching five passes per game, second best in his career, but McLaurin has now gone nine consecutive games without a 100-yard game, dating to last season. He averaged 13.5 fantasy points last season and that has fallen to 12.6, ranking 27th at receiver. One big game could change this direction, but Washington needs to get him more involved downfield to create big plays as he's done in the past. -- John Keim\nWeek 5 ranking: 20\nFantasy surprise: RB Dameon Pierce\nPierce hasn't come close to his production from last year. In his rookie season, he averaged 72 yards rushing per game. This season, it's at 49.4. He only has one game over 70 yards rushing with multiple outings of under 40. There have been a rash of injuries on the offensive line, but when left tackle Laremy Tunsil and right tackle Tytus Howard were available against the Atlanta Falcons, Pierce only averaged 3.3 yards per carry. -- DJ Bien-Aime\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\nWeek 5 ranking: 21\nFantasy surprise: WR Treylon Burks\nBurks looked like a much-improved version of himself when he reported to training camp this summer. The second-year receiver exuded confidence and it was clear that he committed to refining his physique during the offseason. The way Burks was catching everything during training camp made it seem like a big season was on the horizon. Then he suffered a sprained LCL that kept him out for 12 days. But he managed to start the first two games of the season before missing Weeks 4 and 5. Burks has six receptions for 99 yards and no touchdowns in two games this season. -- Turron Davenport\nWeek 5 ranking: 28\nFantasy surprise: RB Dalvin Cook\nNot a good surprise. Cook has been ineffective in the running game, with no touchdowns and only 97 yards in five games. The Jets' plan was to lean on Cook in the early portion of the season, giving Breece Hall more time to recover from last year's knee surgery. Cook didn't maximize his chances and now Hall's clearly the RB. Cook has only 44 touches and it would be surprising if that rate increases. -- Rich Cimini\nWeek 5 ranking: 24\nFantasy surprise: RB Alexander Mattison\nMattison himself has been decent when called upon, and a pair of touchdown receptions has boosted his fantasy point total. But in building their offense around receiver Justin Jefferson, and in attempting to come back from early deficits, the Vikings simply haven't run the ball much. They lead the NFL in passing attempts (204) and have fewer carries by running backs than all but one team. The biggest surprise is that Mattison, a powerful inside runner, hasn't been able to punch it into the end zone on any of his 11 red zone carries. The Vikings are one of two teams that don't have a rushing touchdown. -- Kevin Seifert\nWeek 5 ranking: 29\nFantasy surprise: WR Hunter Renfrow\nThe former Pro Bowler caught 103 passes two years ago, and after suffering through an injury-plagued season in 2022, he was expected to be a major part of the Raiders' offense this year. Instead, the slot man has been more the forgotten man with just 6 catches on 9 targets for 59 yards and without a score. Renfrow's relative absence has been one of the bigger mysteries through the first quarter of the season. -- Paul Gutierrez\nWeek 5 ranking: 23\nFantasy surprise: WR Michael Wilson\nThe rookie out of Stanford has 15 catches for 255 yards and two touchdowns in his first five games, quickly becoming one of Joshua Dobbs' favorite targets. He started from Day 1 and showed quickly he has what it takes to not just make plays but make big plays, and that's expected to continue. -- Josh Weinfuss\nWeek 5 ranking: 26\nFantasy surprise: Nobody\nReally, you just don't want to play anybody on the Giants for fantasy right now. This is a group that is averaging 12.4 points per game and can't run consistent offense because of their offensive line. It has rendered basically all their weapons useless. Tight end Darren Waller has been the only player who has even been (somewhat) productive with 23 receptions for 239 yards, yet fantasy football players have likely been disappointed if he's on their roster. -- Jordan Raanan\n• The NFL Academy is helping internationally\n• 49ers send statement in Cowboys blowout\n• Kupp, Nacua Rams' 'champagne problem'\n• Jets RB Hall shows world he's back\n• Early struggles have Cards behind 8 ball\n• Packers' offense still looking for 'mojo'\nWeek 5 ranking: 32\nFantasy surprise: WR DJ Moore\nIn theory, this shouldn't be a surprise. The Bears brought Moore in to elevate Chicago's offense. He should be getting double-digit targets a game, but the fact that he's second in fantasy points scored after the struggles this passing game went through in three of its first five games is the best outcome any fantasy owner could have hoped for. Moore exploded for 230 receiving yards and three touchdowns against Washington and has a chance for another big outing against Minnesota's 22nd-ranked pass defense. -- Courtney Cronin\nWeek 5 ranking: 27\nFantasy surprise: TE Hunter Henry\nNot many choices from a team that has scored just 55 points all season, but Henry ranks 10th among tight ends in fantasy points scored with 17 receptions for 176 yards and 2 touchdowns. He's been one of the few bright spots and is a consistent presence on the field, having played 83% of the offensive snaps. -- Mike Reiss\nWeek 5 ranking: 30\nFantasy surprise: RB Jaleel McLaughlin\nThe undrafted rookie continues to be a big play waiting to happen. He is tied for the team lead in touchdowns with three -- one rushing, two receiving -- is the team's leading rusher, is averaging 7.3 yards per carry and has four rushing attempts of at least 12 yards in the last two games alone. The Broncos say he's going to get more touches because he's earned them. -- Jeff Legwold\nWeek 5 ranking: 31\nFantasy surprise: RB Miles Sanders\nSanders was signed during the offseason to be the every-down back and a dual-threat player. He's been anything but. Sunday's loss at Detroit was a sign his role is being diminished after he had one fewer snap than backup Chuba Hubbard. In five games, Sanders has only 191 yards rushing and is averaging a career-low 3.1 yards per carry. He has only 15 catches for 81 yards. He's definitely trending downward. -- David Newton"}

Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!\nManchester United have added Sporting CP centre-back Gonçalo Inacio to their shortlist as the Premier League club continue their search for a January signing, according to Fabrizio Romano.\nIt is reported that Man United are planning to send scouts to Portugal to watch the 22-year-old, who has also recently been linked with Liverpool and Newcastle.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Analytics explain what's behind Man City's poor start\nThe Red Devils have made the centre of defence a priority for January. Manager Erik ten Hag has been without Lisandro Martínez for a period of time, while England international Harry Maguire is yet to fully convince the former Ajax head coach after a potential move to West Ham broke down in the summer.\nInacio is believed to be the latest of a number of options under consideration by Manchester United, amid reports that they are also exploring moves for Jean-Clair Todibo of Nice, António Silva of Benfica, and Edmond Tapsoba of Bayer Leverkusen.\nMan United will need to negotiate for Inanco -- the Portugal international remains contracted at the Liga Portugal side until 2027 after he signed extended terms in the summer. Sporting CP have reportedly confirmed that he has a release clause in his contract worth €60 million.\n- Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is attracting interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich, reports Sport. The Blaugrana are reported to be keen to land a defensive midfielder next summer, and Ndidi, 26, has emerged as a potential candidate, with his contract set to expire at the end of the season. They are also said to be interested in Real Betis star Guido Rodríguez.\n- Real Madrid are preparing to announce that winger Vinicius Jr. has signed a new long-term contract, writes Fabrizio Romano. The club have rescheduled the ceremony that will see his deal become official, as they are waiting for president Florentino Perez to test negative with COVID-19. It is reported that there is a release clause in the Brazil international's contract for €1 billion.\n- Striker Anthony Martial doesn't want to remain at Manchester United if he continues to struggle to garner regular minutes, reveals Football Insider. The 27-year-old is set to be out of contract in the summer, but unless there is the prospect of being handed a starting role, it is believed that he will look at leaving Old Trafford, which would be almost nine years since he arrived from Monaco in 2015.\n- Bayern Munich are hopeful of initiating talks over a new contract for winger Leroy Sané, reveals Nicolo Schira. The 27-year-old entered the final year of his contract in the summer, and he has recently been linked with both Barcelona and Real Madrid, but it looks as though the Bundesliga champions are looking to keep him at the Allianz Arena, with hopes of signing him to a reported five-year deal until 2028.\n- Internazionale are keen on Atalanta centre-back Giorgio Scalvini, according to Calciomercato. The Nerazzurri are said to have tracked the 19-year-old for a number of transfer windows, and they are set to make another approach to secure his signature. Scalvini has been a standout in the Serie A, with form that has seen him become a regular for the Italy senior national team."}

(1:59)\nLAS VEGAS -- Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson had the thought more than once as she watched a video about the 2014 NBA champion San Antonio Spurs.\n\"These guys,\" she thought, \"are a lot like us.\"\nCenter/forward Tim Duncan, small forward Kawhi Leonard, shooting guard Manu Ginobili and point guard Tony Parker were the core of that Spurs team. Wilson and guards Chelsea Gray, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young are the core of the Aces, the defending WNBA champions driven in their quest to repeat their title this year.\nLas Vegas coach Becky Hammon thought it would help the Aces to watch how the Spurs played and supported one another in 2014, when San Antonio won its fifth and most recent NBA title.\nThe Aces' championship under Hammon last year showed the players' ability to bond together. They haven't needed external motivation this year in trying to run it back. Still, Hammon wanted the Aces to take note of how the Spurs rallied around one another in 2014.\n\"I see lots of similarities in the character of the teams,\" Hammon said. \"The care factor that 2014 team had, the unselfishness, the commitment to whatever it takes to win, no matter who gets the credit.\n\"That's what I wanted from us going into this postseason. I told them, 'You have the character to do it. There are going to be some games where we have to win with defense and unselfishness.'\"\nThe Aces are 6-0 in the playoffs, beating the New York Liberty 99-82 on Sunday in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. Las Vegas will try to take a commanding lead in the best-of-five series in Game 2 on Wednesday (9 p.m. PT, ESPN/ESPN App) at Michelob Ultra Arena.\nNo team since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-2002 has won back-to-back WNBA titles. Hammon played against that Sparks team, just as she did versus the Houston Comets (four consecutive titles from 1997 to 2000) and the Minnesota Lynx (four titles from 2011 to 2017).\nHammon was near the end of her playing career in 2014, having suffered a torn ACL early in the 2013 WNBA season. So she began preparation for her coaching future, spending the NBA season with the Spurs throughout 2013-14 as she rehabbed her knee.\nHammon returned to the court to play her final WNBA season in 2014, then officially joined Gregg Popovich's Spurs coaching staff that fall.\nSoccer is frequently referred to as \"the beautiful game,\" but basketball the way it was played by the 2014 Spurs at their best was just as stunning. It was like a symphony of passing. The Spurs could work the ball around as if they were magicians doing sleight-of-hand tricks until they had the best look, possession after possession.\nComing off the disappointment of losing the 2013 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat, the Spurs returned their core players and went 62-20 in 2013-14. They led the NBA in assists per game (25.2), 3-point percentage (39.7) and net rating (8.1); were second in field goal percentage (48.6); and ranked sixth in scoring average.\nTheir cohesiveness and how supportive they were of one another stood out even beyond the numbers.\n\"Watching the Spurs now makes me think of some of the similarities there are between us,\" said Wilson, who was a high school senior in 2014. \"They all had the ability to take over a game, but they knew they couldn't win a championship without each other.\n\"That's us, too. We know we are fully capable of being individual stars. But we can't reach our overall goal without each other. We hold each other accountable, we'll make sacrifices.

Gray as a point guard said she has done that a few times herself.\n\"What really stood out to me is that everybody was playing for each other,\" Gray said. \"You have the most success when you want the best for people playing next to you.

{"title": "'I know I can overcome': Betnijah Laney, Liberty look to bounce back in WNBA Finals", "date": "2023-10-11 01:15:49", "text": "Aces outscore the Liberty by 20 points in the second half to take Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. (1:59)\nLAS VEGAS -- Jonathan Kolb was named the 2023 WNBA Executive of the Year after getting Jonquel Jones, Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot to come to New York this past offseason, an endeavor that involved an international recruiting effort in Turkey in January.\nBut the New York Liberty's general manager swears he has never worked harder than when he got Betnijah Laney to sign with the team in 2021.\nNew York was coming off a 2-20 season that year, but Kolb had identified Laney -- a 6-foot guard/forward named the 2020 Most Improved Player following a career season with the Atlanta Dream -- as the Liberty's highest priority. The organization thought she'd pair well with guard Sabrina Ionescu, New York's No. 1 overall pick in 2020.\n\"It's hard to speak the vision into existence [after a two-win season], but she really was bought-in during our conversations during that time,\" Kolb told ESPN this week. \"When we looked at the future free agent classes, she was somebody we would be really fortunate to get at that time.\"\nLaney's 2021 signing didn't pay off in just that season. For as much attention as New York's newcomers have received this summer, and rightfully so, Laney has been the X factor in the postseason, a massive reason the Liberty are playing in their first Finals since 2002. And for them to overcome an early 1-0 deficit versus the Las Vegas Aces -- the series resumes Wednesday (9 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN App) -- and win the franchise's first championship, they'll have to continue to get tremendous play from her on both ends.\n\"Laney has been amazing for them. I don't know where they're at without Laney,\" Aces coach Becky Hammon said heading into the Finals. \"... I mean, I'm a fan.\"\nFew would have foreseen Laney making such a big impact on such a big stage early in her pro career. A second-round pick out of Rutgers in 2015, she saw limited time with the Chicago Sky and Connecticut Sun before bursting onto the scene in 2020 with Atlanta -- right after being cut by the Indiana Fever just prior to the start of that season in the bubble.\nLaney established herself as a fantastic defender going back to her days playing for C. Vivian Stringer at Rutgers, but her offensive game exploded in 2020. She had never averaged more than 5.6 points in a season prior to 2020. But once then-head coach Nicki Collen gave her the green light, Laney put up 17.2 points per game that year for the Dream.\nWhen Laney signed with New York in free agency, she viewed the organization as one that took care of its players the most on and off the court, and a franchise with a growth trajectory she wanted to be a part of. Ionescu still wasn't back to 100% after a season-ending ankle injury three games into her rookie season, and Laney was the go-to player in 2021, leading New York in scoring and earning her first WNBA All-Star bid.\nLaney was then limited to just nine regular-season games in 2022 after undergoing meniscus surgery in her right knee before returning for the playoffs. Her absence stunted a still-developing New York team that finished 16-20 before falling to Chicago in the first round -- \"obviously it changed to our growth,\" Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said of Laney's injury.\n\"I think people can now see the impact that she's had, how important she is to everything we do,\" Kolb added.\nAs the Liberty brought in a star-studded haul of players this offseason, Laney and Ionescu were the remaining holdovers of the pre-superteam era, main fixtures of teams whose ceiling had been simply making the playoffs. They'd been in New York even longer than Brondello, who was hired in December 2021. The Liberty knew Laney would be an important part of the equation, but it took time to figure out how.\nIn other words, as Brondello put it, \"all of them can have a piece of the pie.\"\nBetnijah Laney accelerates past her defender and finishes the layup for the and-1.\nThe Liberty have discussed since February the collective sacrifice it took, in role and even in salary, to come together; but from 2021 to now, arguably no one's role changed more than Laney's, and not just in terms of usage. The team worked with her to adjust her shot profile, prioritizing efficient shots like corner 3s (now more available to her given the talent around her) and posting her up on smaller guards, as opposed to less efficient midrange shots that she might have gravitated toward earlier in her career.\nThe Liberty can still initiate offense through her -- she averaged 5.2 assists per game in 2021 versus 2.4 this season -- but it's a more efficient process as they don't have to depend on her always having the ball in her hands.\n\"If you go back to where we clicked as a team, it's almost when that clicked [for Laney],\" Kolb said.\nLaney might not be asked to score as often as she did in 2020 or 2021, but her efficiency is at an all-time high (49.9% from the field in the regular season). She's taking more 3-pointers than ever (3.8 per game) and making a healthy 39.2%.\nBeing persistent, poised and prepared was the key to success for the Aces guards in Game 1 🔑@andraya_carter | @chiney pic.twitter.com/bCbhgRZumT\nHer offense has been critical in the postseason, where her shot attempts are slightly up (13.3 per game versus 10.0 in the regular season) and her efficiency is still strong; at 16.1 points per game, she's the Liberty's third-highest scorer in the playoffs, only a hair behind Jones (16.4).\n\"I know it was a little bit of a process early in the season,\" Brondello said. \"We were trying to work it out, how it all combined, but I think we took off when we found B getting more integrated into the offense because she's an amazing scorer. We just didn't want it to just be B the defensive player.\"\nIndeed. Across the regular season and postseason, the Liberty are 21-2 when Laney scores at least 14 points. In the playoffs they are 0-2 when she doesn't hit the mark, such as Sunday in Game 1, when Laney was limited to 11 points off eight field goal attempts, the fewest she has taken in a game this postseason.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nHer intangibles are just as crucial, especially for a team that has had to mesh so many players. Two-time MVP A'ja Wilson of the Aces noted Laney's motor makes her so tough to guard. Hammon appreciates how Laney not only makes big shots and defends the other team's best perimeter player, but also rebounds and sets picks.\nJones said Laney always talks with players on the court and makes sure they're locked in and staying in plays. Laney counts down the team huddles, Kolb revealed, something she has done throughout her tenure in New York.\n\"Heart is our word this year, and she's kind of the heart [of the team],\" said Kolb, who last month locked in Laney for another two years before she would have hit unrestricted free agency this offseason.\nFor as much as her offensive game has become an asset, Laney is equally important in setting the tone on the defensive end. That's especially true in this series, where she has been tasked with defending point guard Chelsea Gray, oftentimes full-court. Laney's grit and toughness -- she said she has been fiery ever since she was a child -- often change the complexion of a game, and those attributes are a must as the Liberty look to overcome their 1-0 Finals deficit.\nFortunately for the Liberty, Laney is equipped to bounce back. She has made a career of it.\n\"Injuries, being waived, it made me hungry. Each and every thing that I've gone through has helped prepare me for this moment right now, where if something happens, it doesn't faze me,\" Laney told ESPN. \"Whether it was an injury, I've bounced back from it, I know that I can overcome that. Being waived, I know how to deal with that, and just come out and be my best self. Whatever it is that's going on around me, I feel like I've endured and I've been able to overcome and see it through.\"\nRegardless of how the series pans out, the moment isn't lost on Laney. It wasn't long ago that she was cut from the Fever and searching for a new home. It wasn't long ago that the Liberty weren't part of the championship conversation.\nBut for the foreseeable future, New York and Laney are in it together, to compete for titles and fulfill the vision she and Kolb believed in when they joined forces in 2021. And she won't be an afterthought in that endeavor.\n\"I think every obstacle, everything was worth it,\" Laney said, \"because it all got me to this moment right here.\""}
{"title": "How Alabama bounced back from early stumbles to take charge of the SEC West", "date": "2023-10-11 04:12:56", "text": "Nick Saban talks about the pride he has in his Alabama team after how the Crimson Tide competed in the second half against Texas A&M. (2:13)\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas -- The midpoint of the season is no place to make any iron-clad (or crimson-clad) declarations in college football.\nBut if history is any indication, Nick Saban has his doubters right where he wants them following Alabama's 26-20 victory over Texas A&M at raucous Kyle Field on Saturday.\nIt was only a month ago that we heard some of the same warnings we've heard before when Saban and the Tide have lost, which has happened only six times in his last 50 games -- with five of those defeats coming to teams ranked in the top 15 nationally.\nImmediately after the 34-24 home loss to Texas in Week 2, the familiar alarms went off: that the dynasty might be dead, that some cracks in the foundation might be forming, that while Saban might not have completely lost his fastball, he surely had lost some velocity.\nBut here we are, six games into the season, and the Crimson Tide are sitting atop the SEC West as the only unbeaten team in league play.\n\"I like this team. I like the way this team practices, the way these kids want to practice and want to compete. It's a good group of kids,\" Saban told ESPN earlier this month. \"We've just got to execute better and pay more attention to detail, and we've got some areas on our team that need to play better. We're going to keep working with them to get there because this team has everything it takes to be really, really good.\"\nAt no point has Saban suggested this can be a great team. Of course, he didn't say that about the 2020 unbeaten national championship squad or any of his other teams, either. That's just not his style.\nBut with a manageable path ahead to the SEC championship game (the next three games, against Arkansas, Tennessee and LSU, are all at home), Alabama is alive and well despite its warts.\nAnd while this might not be Saban's most talented, most complete or deepest team, it might be the most fulfilling one he's had if it is able to get to Atlanta and, at the very least, play for an SEC title.\nBut all that, in Saban vernacular, is nothing but noise, something his players repeated over and over following the win over the Aggies.\n\"From this point forward, we're just going to keep working and keep trying to improve and block out the outside noise because the only people that can make any game a big game are the fans and the media, because it's not the players,\" said receiver Jermaine Burton, who torched A&M with nine catches for 197 yards and two touchdowns.\nBurton's emergence on offense has been complemented by a defense that has allowed just five touchdowns in four games since the Texas loss and is starting to look like some of the disruptive units that were the cornerstones of Saban's championship teams. There might not be as many first- and second-round NFL draft picks on this defense as in past years, but Bama is tied for third nationally in sacks (22), tied for third in the SEC in interceptions (seven) and is one of only three SEC teams, along with Georgia and Texas A&M, to rank in the top 30 nationally in both rushing defense and passing defense.\n\"They are a lot better on defense than what people thought coming out of the Texas game and are only getting better,\" one SEC coach told ESPN.\nRest assured, this week of practice won't be a picnic for anybody at Alabama. Not after the Tide committed 14 penalties (nine pre-snap penalties on offense), had two turnovers, gained a measly 23 rushing yards, had quarterback Jalen Milroe get sacked six times, had a touchdown called back on a blocked field-goal attempt and mismanaged the clock at the end of the game.\nAs one Alabama staff member said Saturday as the players headed toward the team bus, \"This is when Coach is at his best. He'll be on everybody's ass. You'd never know that we just won the game.\"\nSaban's message to his team late Saturday afternoon in the visiting locker room was both pointed and firm. He didn't hold back and knows as well as anybody that this team doesn't have the margin of error that some of his other teams did.\n\"Where it shows up the most is our depth. We don't have the depth we used to,\" Saban told ESPN. \"But I don't know that anybody does with the portal. It's even more important for me to be positive with this team and do everything we can as coaches to make sure they do it the way we want it done.\n\"How much can we improve in the areas that are hurting us right now, all the self-inflicted wounds? That's the question. So any frustration I might have is with myself in making sure we get that done and not with the players.\"\nOne factor that has worked against Alabama is the turnover on the coaching staff, and Saban admitted having so many coaches coming and going has been a challenge. At some point, teaching the coaches every year how he wants things done becomes taxing. Alabama has two new coordinators this season, Tommy Rees on offense and Kevin Steele on defense. Rees is Alabama's sixth offensive coordinator since the 2016 season, and Saban has also had to replace numerous position coaches over the last few years.\n\"We've had so many new coaches, and for different reasons,\" Saban said. \"I can't be in every position room, and it becomes a challenge in trying to teach people to do things the way you want them done, but not inhibit them from doing what they want to do, but still kind of doing what you believe in.\"\nIt's true that Saban, who turns 72 later this month, is not enamored with the current version of college football, specifically the transfer portal making it more difficult to develop players and create depth and NIL being used as a way to pay players out of high school.\nWhat isn't true is that Saban, with his six national championships at Alabama, is ready to go quietly into the night. The retirement talk will continue to pick up steam, as it would for any coach Saban's age, but his zest to challenge his players and himself to be the very best hasn't waned one bit.\nIt's been a while (maybe going back to Saban's first season) since Alabama has been on the outside looking in as far as being equipped to make a national title run.\nHow will Saturday's top games affect the College Football Playoff chase? What are the current odds for the top four? The Allstate Playoff Predictor has the answers. Check back every week as the odds are updated following that week's games.\nFor the most part, his players don't seem to mind the spotlight being directed elsewhere for a change. The only spotlight with any meaning is the one that shines on those teams vying for the four playoff spots come early December.\n\"No matter what opponent we're playing, we're going to give our best, we're going to play four quarters of football, and we're going to have fun,\" Milroe said. \"And we're going to play to the standard that we all know is in our locker room.\"\nIt's a standard that never changes at Alabama.\nMilroe's progression will go a long way toward determining whether the Crimson Tide can get back to the playoff. They've never gone more than two years without winning a national title under Saban, which puts his astonishing run into perspective.\nMilroe is coming off his best game of the season against Texas A&M with 321 yards passing and three touchdowns. He hit several big plays down the field, and all three of his scoring throws came on either second- or third-and-long. The feeling on Alabama's staff is that Milroe is growing as his repetitions in practice and games increase. He split reps all preseason and didn't even play Week 3 against South Florida.\nSaban was heartened to see Milroe respond from his third-quarter interception Saturday with a game-tying touchdown the next time Alabama got the ball. Milroe remains limited in some areas. He's taken too many sacks, doesn't always get to his second option quickly enough and has made some ill-advised decisions on costly interceptions. But playing the way he did against Texas A&M, and doing so in such a hostile environment, was a good sign for him and Alabama.\nAsked where he's grown the most, Milroe said, \"Just acknowledging that I'm not a finished product, but just overall trying to be the best version I can for the team. It's all about the team. There's no single success at all. Everything is for the team, and that's what I try to do as much as possible.\n\"It's just, 'How can I be a better leader, be a better passer and do anything that is asked of me playing quarterback here?'\"\nWhat will Alabama's quarterback situation look like going forward? Milroe has two more seasons remaining. There's a lot of optimism on the staff surrounding true freshman Dylan Lonergan and nobody has given up on redshirt freshman Ty Simpson, who was ESPN's No. 2 dual-threat quarterback prospect in the 2022 signing class. Also, five-star commit Julian Sayin of Carlsbad, California, ESPN's No. 1 dual-threat QB prospect, is part of the 2024 class. The Tide are likely to look in the portal for quarterbacks too.\nElite competition on the practice field has fueled Alabama's championship run under Saban, although stockpiling quarterbacks has become nearly impossible. Regardless, Alabama's quarterback room likely will look different next year.\nOf course, the future for Saban is the next practice or the next meeting.\nJust before he hopped into an SUV that would take him to the College Station airport Saturday, Saban shook his head and pierced his lips tightly.\n\"We're making it way too hard,\" he said in a hushed tone.\nThe truth is it's probably going to be that way the rest of the season for his team.\nBut as Saban has proven, Alabama has long been the SEC's version of Dracula. It seems there's just no killing the Crimson Tide, even when they appear to be at their most vulnerable."}

From the coaching carousel to the transfer portal to early NBA draft entries, the roster of your favorite team might have changed since you clicked on this page. ESPN Bracketology has you covered during the entire offseason, with regular updates as we count down to the 2023-24 campaign. Opening night is less than a month away.\nKansas\nXavier\nTexas Tech\nIn less than four weeks, we'll be poring over the first set of game results and no doubt jumping to all the wrong conclusions. But one assessment seems incontrovertible for the 2023-24 season: The Big East is loaded. Three teams -- defending champion UConn along with Marquette and Creighton -- have legitimate designs on an NCAA title. Villanova, the league's fourth-best squad, can point to a pair of national championships and a trio of No. 1 seeds in the past decade. In short, the Big East can dream of repeating its seemingly unrepeatable feat from 1985: a record three Final Four teams in the same year. It's an unlikely outcome, to be sure, but one that was unthinkable when the conference split from its football members in 2013. Yes, the headlines might proclaim a \"football is king\" narrative, but apparently the Big East folks didn't get the memo.\nMoved Up\nMoved Down\nNew Team to Bracket\nAutomatic Qualifier\nPhoto illo by ESPN Illustration, additional photos courtesy of Getty Images, Associated Press, Imagn, USA TODAY Sports, Icon Sportswire, EPA/Shutterstock\nRULES\nESPN's Bracketology efforts are focused on projecting the NCAA tournament field just as we expect the NCAA Division I basketball committee to select the field in March. ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi uses the same data points favored by the committee, including strength of schedule and other season-long indicators, including the NET and team-sheet data similar to what is available to the NCAA, in his projections of the field. Visit the NCAA's website for a fuller understanding of NCAA selection criteria.\n68-Team Bracket\nThe 68-team bracket is the standard version of the NCAA tournament field that has been in place since 2011. If the 2021 field is comprised of 68 teams, there will be some key differences to past years, however.\nThe primary adjustment from a normal year is, of course, the playing of the entire NCAA tournament at a single site. This eliminates the need for geographical considerations in seeding. Additionally, there will be at least one fewer automatic qualifier this season, as the Ivy League's decision to forgo the 2020-21 season reduces the number of AQ entries to 31 for this season.\n48-Team Bracket\nIn this projection, a condensed selection process would reduce the field by 10 at-large teams and 10 automatic qualifiers (the latter of which still receive a revenue unit). The top four seeds in each region would receive a bye into the second round, with four first-round games per region - 5 vs. 12, 6 vs. 11, 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 - being played without fans on the higher seed's home court.\nTo minimize travel, first-round pairings will be guided by geography to the greatest extent possible. And the reduced field results in only 32 teams competing at the central site. All participants must post a minimum .500 conference record - the \"Lunardi Rule\" - for at-large consideration.\n16-Team Bracket\nIn this projection, the committee selects and seeds the 16 best available teams. There are no automatic qualifiers, although all non-competing conference champions receive the designated revenue unit.\nTo maintain some sense of national balance, conference participation is capped at four teams. And no region shall have more than one team from the same conference."}

Kyle Filipowski looked like a first-round draft pick; Zach Edey was projected to be selected by an NBA team; Hunter Dickinson was being pursued by a long list of schools; top-five recruit Ron Holland was going to play college basketball... the list goes on and on.\nSix months later, the dust has completely settled from the transfer portal, the commitment flips and all the roster machinations in between. So it's time to unveil our final preseason Top 25 of the offseason.\nThe big question: Did we go with Duke or Kansas at No. 1?\nIn terms of pure talent, Duke has the edge. The Blue Devils have three players -- Filipowski, Tyrese Proctor and Jared McCain -- projected to be selected in the top 20 of the 2024 NBA draft, plus another, Mark Mitchell, in the early second round. Meanwhile, Kansas has just one such player (Elmarko Jackson) per ESPN's 2024 mock draft.\nBut in terms of proven quality at the college level, the Jayhawks are loaded. Dickinson is a preseason All-American -- and perhaps the biggest threat to Edey's chances at repeating as the Wooden Award winner -- while Dajuan Harris Jr. and Kevin McCullar Jr. are among the best players in the country at their positions.\nEntering the 2023-24 season, we'll side with experience, and Bill Self, and go with the Jayhawks atop the rankings.\nAnd with less than one month until the tipoff of the 2023-24 college basketball season, despite the headline, this is no longer Way-Too-Early.

Adams Jr. is what makes the Jayhawks a national championship contender. Harris is one of the elite pass-first guards in the country and a terrific defender, while McCullar is versatile and really defends. Adams' role will change next to Dickinson, but he was one of the breakout stars of last season and should take an even bigger step in this one. That said, Dickinson's arrival gives Bill Self one of the most dominant players in college basketball -- and an anchor around which to build his offense.\nProjected starting lineup:\nDajuan Harris Jr. (8.9 PPG)\nElmarko Jackson (No. 26 in ESPN 100)\nKevin McCullar Jr. (10.7 PPG)\nK.J.

He's a potential first-team All-American and likely draft lottery pick who was one of the best freshmen in the country a year ago. Jon Scheyer also has two first-rounders in the backcourt in sophomore Tyrese Proctor and Jared McCain, as well as experience at point guard with Jeremy Roach.\nProjected starting lineup:\nJeremy Roach (13.6 PPG)\nTyrese Proctor (9.4 PPG)\nJared McCain (No. 12 in ESPN 100)\nMark Mitchell (9.1 PPG)\nKyle Filipowski (15.1 PPG)\nPrevious: 3\nIt's once again all about Zach Edey in West Lafayette. The reigning Wooden Award winner is the heavy favorite to repeat as the best player in men's college basketball, and his deadline day decision to return to the Boilermakers makes them the Big Ten favorite. The supporting cast remains intact, too. Matt Painter will have all five starters back from a squad that won the Big Ten regular-season and conference tournament championships and earned a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament. Braden Smith and Fletcher Loyer will have to become more consistent to take the next step, however.\nProjected starting lineup:\nBraden Smith (9.7 PPG)\nFletcher Loyer (11.0 PPG)\nEthan Morton (3.8 PPG)\nTrey Kaufman-Renn (4.5 PPG)\nZach Edey (22.3 PPG)\nPrevious: 4\nTom Izzo has a little bit of everything on this season's roster: experience, elite guards, and depth and explosiveness in the form of talented newcomers. Tyson Walker and Malik Hall opted to take advantage of their extra year of eligibility, while A.J. Hoggard and Jaden Akins decided to return to East Lansing instead of turning pro. And Izzo is adding a high-level recruiting class that includes top-30 recruits Xavier Booker, Jeremy Fears and Coen Carr.\nProjected starting lineup:\nTyson Walker (14.8 PG)\nA.J.

Sampson replaced Marcus Sasser and Tramon Mark with transfers LJ Cryer and Damian Dunn, while double-figure scorers Jamal Shead and J'Wan Roberts are both back. Emanuel Sharp or Terrance Arceneaux becoming a reliable wing scorer might be the key, along with Houston continuing its dominant rebounding and defense.\nProjected starting lineup:\nJamal Shead (10.5 PPG)\nLJ Cryer (15.0 PPG at Baylor)\nEmanuel Sharp (5.9 PPG)\nDamian Dunn (15.3 PPG at Temple)\nJ'Wan Roberts (10.0 PPG)\nPrevious: 10\nEntering the offseason, it looked as if Shaka Smart would be able to run his entire team back for another season. But Olivier-Maxence Prosper blew away scouts and NBA teams at the draft combine and opted to stay in the draft rather than return to the Golden Eagles. Every other key player is back, though, including All-American Tyler Kolek and three other starters, as well as sixth man David Joplin, who should slot right into the lineup for Prosper.\nProjected starting lineup:\nTyler Kolek (12.9 PPG)\nStevie Mitchell (7.1 PPG)\nKam Jones (15.1 PPG)\nDavid Joplin (9.2 PPG)\nOso Ighodaro (11.4 PPG)\nPrevious: 8\nRick Barnes entered the offseason knowing his team needed to improve on the offensive end. An elite defensive team the past three years, the Volunteers were too often let down by scoring droughts. So he brought in Dalton Knecht (Northern Colorado) and Jordan Gainey (South Carolina Upstate) to boost the perimeter shooting and scoring, while early buzz about freshman Freddie Dilione is hugely positive. All-SEC guard Santiago Vescovi and veteran starter Josiah-Jordan James are both back, but Zakai Zeigler's health and availability will be the key.\nProjected starting lineup:\nFreddie Dilione (No. 38 in ESPN 100)\nSantiago Vescovi (12.5 PPG)\nDalton Knecht (20.2 PPG at Northern Colorado)\nJosiah-Jordan James (10.0 PPG)\nJonas Aidoo (5.1 PPG)\nPrevious: 13\nIt was an up-and-down offseason for Greg McDermott, who lost starters Ryan Nembhard and Arthur Kaluma to the transfer portal but convinced Baylor Scheierman, Trey Alexander and Ryan Kalkbrenner to withdraw their names from the NBA draft and return to Omaha.

Anton Watson will once again start and provide two-way ability and leadership, but Few will need consistency from Nolan Hickman and the rest of the newcomers to provide depth.\nProjected starting lineup:\nRyan Nembhard (12.1 PPG at Creighton)\nNolan Hickman (7.7 PPG)\nSteele Venters (15.3 PPG at Eastern Washington)\nAnton Watson (11.1 PPG)\nGraham Ike (19.5 PPG at Wyoming in 2021-22)\nPrevious: 9\nRanking the Owls 11th in the country might seem lofty given they were a 9-seed in the NCAA tournament and nearly lost to Memphis in the first round. But this is also a team that won 35 games, made a Final Four run and is bringing back all five starters. It's a testament to Dusty May that he was able to keep the core of this group together, with zero players entering the transfer portal or NBA draft.

He then went out and surrounded his two returning stars with intriguing complementary players. Notre Dame transfer Cormac Ryan is a veteran shooter, and Harrison Ingram from Stanford is a versatile wing. The final piece to the puzzle was top-10 2024 prospect Elliot Cadeau, who opted to reclassify and suit up for the Tar Heels this fall.

The native of Fairmont, West Virginia, scored two perfect 10s to win gold in the all-around competition -- one of five medals, along with two silvers and two bronzes, she won in Los Angeles.\n\"After Mary Lou, we had to create a new type of gymnast who could impress with her sturdiness, energy and the physicality of her performance,\" her former coach, Bela Karolyi, told ESPN in 2012.\nRetton had traded the all-around lead with Romania's Ecaterina Szabo.

(0:56)\nARLINGTON, Texas -- Corey Seager is still going deep in Texas during the postseason. This time he is doing it for the Rangers, who are streaking through October.\nSeager and Adolis García homered early, Nathan Eovaldi pitched seven smooth innings in another playoff clincher and Texas completed an AL Division Series sweep of the Baltimore Orioles with a 7-1 victory in Game 3 on Tuesday night.\n\"We've just been playing good ball,\" Seager said. \"Can't say enough about what our pitching staff has been able to do.\"\nThe Rangers, whose loss at Seattle on the last day of the regular season made them a wild-card team instead of the AL West champion, have since won all five of their postseason games. They are headed to the American League Championship Series for the first time since 2011.\n\"We had our work cut out going on the road against Tampa and Baltimore,\" said Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a three-time World Series champion with San Francisco who is now going to his first ALCS. \"Just shows the toughness with this ballclub and the deal with having to fly to Tampa. Trust me, they wanted to win one more game in the worst way. Didn't happen. ... They put it behind them.\"\nThe AL East champion Orioles, who won a league-high 101 games, were the only team in baseball to not get swept in a series during the regular season, but are now done after a sweep at the most inopportune time. The Orioles are the second team in MLB history to go a non-shortened regular season without being swept and then get swept in the postseason. The 1998 Padres were swept by the Yankees in the World Series.\nBaltimore has lost eight playoff games in a row over the past 10 seasons.\n\"Really proud of our group,\" Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. \"They defied all the odds. Nobody gave us a chance. These guys played their butts off for six months. We just didn't play well for these last three [games], unfortunately.\"\nIt was the first Rangers playoff game at Globe Life Field, the stadium that was brand new in 2020 when it hosted much of MLB's neutral postseason during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers spent most of that October there, and Seager was the MVP in both the NLCS and World Series. A year later, the shortstop went to Texas on a $325 million, 10-year deal and now he occupies the same locker he did during that most unusual postseason with limited attendance.\nWith a full house for his first home playoff game with the Rangers, Seager sent the record sellout crowd of 40,861 into a frenzy when he connected in his first at-bat, pulling a 445-foot drive into the right-field seats. He went deep seven times for the Dodgers here in 2020.\n\"That's what he does. He's done it before in the big moments,\" said Marcus Semien, the second baseman who signed with Texas for $175 million over seven years the same week as Seager's deal. \"He picks his game up in the playoffs. It'll be really fun to see what he can do as we move on.\"\nGarcía's three-run homer -- one the All-Star slugger admired while taking a few slow steps out of the batter's box -- made it 6-0 in the second to chase Orioles right-hander Dean Kremer, the Israeli-American pitcher making his first career postseason start.\nNathaniel Lowe also homered for Texas, a solo shot in the sixth. Lowe had led off the Rangers' five-run second inning with a lineout to left, but that came on the 15th pitch of the at-bat after fouling off nine two-strike pitches.\nThis is Bruce Bochy's 15th career postseason series win, the third-most by a manager all-time, trailing Joe Torre (19) and Tony La Russa (16). Bochy has a 15-5 round record in his managerial career (.750 win percentage). That is the best among managers to manage 10 rounds in MLB postseason history.\n\"I saw a team that was really motivated,\" Bochy said. \"The offense, everybody was doing something to contribute.\"\nSeager is one of five Texas hitters who started for the AL squad in this year's All-Star Game. That is quite a lineup for Bochy, who was hired last offseason by Rangers general manager Chris Young, one of the manager's former pitchers in San Diego.\nAlso an All-Star in his first season with the Rangers, Eovaldi has won both their series-clinching games this postseason. Those are the right-hander's longest and best two starts since returning in September after missing seven weeks because of a right forearm strain.\nEovaldi threw 76 of 98 pitches for strikes without a walk while allowing only one run and striking out seven. He was serenaded with chants of his name as he walked off the mound after the seventh -- and then was prodded out of the dugout by García to tip his cap to the crowd. Eovaldi also won the wild-card series clincher at Tampa Bay last Wednesday.\n\"I've never had a curtain call or anything like that, but our fans were bringing it all night long,\" he said. \"When I walked out at 6:30 tonight, they were chanting, 'Let's go Rangers.' I knew it was going to be a really good night for us.\"\nJose Leclerc got the final four outs, the first one with the bases loaded in the eighth when he induced an inning-ending groundout by pinch hitter Aaron Hicks, who in the ninth inning of Game 2 had hit a three-run homer off him.\nLeclerc pitched a perfect ninth, setting off celebratory fireworks inside the ballpark when he struck out Jordan Westburg to end the game.\nKremer's 1⅔ innings marked his shortest outing all season. The 27-year-old wore a Star of David necklace as usual, with thoughts of extended family members in Israel, where war has been declared following a deadly incursion by militant group Hamas. His mother was at the game.\nKremer was 13-5 with a 4.12 ERA in 32 regular-season starts that included Baltimore's two clinching games: Sept. 17 to secure a playoff spot, and 11 days later for the team's 100th win to clinch the AL East.\n\"Offensively, we weren't at our best the last two, three weeks of the season. That carried into the postseason where we had guys scuffling,\" Hyde said. \"They rolled in with a ton of momentum. I don't think we rolled in with a ton of momentum offensively.\"\nThe Rangers now wait to see if they will be going to Houston or Minnesota for ALCS Game 1 on Sunday.\nESPN Stats & Information and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The news was first reported by The Athletic.\nWeatherspoon -- who was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019 -- returns to the league after a lengthy stint working with the New Orleans Pelicans, first as a player development coach in 2019 and then as an assistant since 2020. During her playing career, Weatherspoon was a two-time Defensive Player of the Year, a five-time All-Star and a four-time WNBA second-team honoree, mostly playing for the New York Liberty before finishing with the Los Angeles Sparks.\nWeatherspoon also won the 1988 NCAA championship with Louisiana Tech, where she previously served as head coach from 2009 to 2014, and played for the U.S. Olympic team in 1988 and 1992, winning gold and bronze medals in those competitions, respectively.\nThe Sky were in the search for a new head coach after James Wade left midseason for an NBA assistant-coaching job. The 2021 WNBA champs have appeared in the postseason for five straight years, although they finished the 2023 regular season a meager 18-22 before falling to the Las Vegas Aces in the first round of the playoffs.\nThe organization announced at the end of the season that interim Emre Vatansever would not return as head coach.\nDespite a tumultuous 2023 that saw the departures of Candace Parker, Courtney Vandersloot, Allie Quigley, Azura Stevens and Emma Meesseman in the offseason, things are looking up for Chicago. It brought in Dwyane Wade as a minority owner in July, re-signed 2021 Finals MVP Kahleah Copper to a two-year extension before she hit free agency and now is bringing in a big-name head coach.\nWeatherspoon was a highly regarded voice in New Orleans, garnering immense praise and respect from franchise player Zion Williamson. She was also in the running for the Phoenix Mercury's head-coaching job in 2022 before she reportedly withdrew her name from consideration after the Pelicans successfully fought to keep her.\nWith Weatherspoon's hire, the league will have six head-coaching positions occupied by former players. The Mercury have the only other vacant head-coaching job, with former player Nikki Blue serving as interim head coach this season."}

(1:01)\nThe Atlanta Falcons traded for Los Angeles Rams receiver Van Jefferson on Tuesday.\nAs part of the deal, the Falcons sent a 2025 sixth-round pick to the Rams for a seventh-round selection in the same year.\nIn his fourth season out of Florida, Jefferson has eight catches for 108 yards and no touchdowns.\nThe 6-foot-1, 200-pound receiver has played in 49 games for Los Angeles, making 30 starts. His best year came in 2021, when the Rams made their Super Bowl run. He started every game that season and had career highs in targets (89), catches (50), yards (802) and touchdowns (six).\nJefferson, 27, has struggled to secure a substantial role this season in part because of the emergence of rookie star Puka Nacua and third-year receiver Tutu Atwell. He was on the field for just two offensive plays in the Rams' 23-14 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, as Los Angeles' receiving corps was bolstered by All-Pro Cooper Kupp's return from injured reserve.\nJefferson will now join an Atlanta wide receivers group led by Drake London, the Falcons' first-round pick in 2022, and Mack Hollins, who signed a one-year contract with Atlanta this past offseason. He provides another offensive option for the Falcons and second-year quarterback Desmond Ridder, who is coming off the best game of his career, completing 75.7% of his passes for 329 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.\nWith a late-round pick swap, it's a low-risk, potentially high-reward move for Atlanta, similar to the trade the franchise made with New England for tight end Jonnu Smith in March. Smith now leads the Falcons in receiving yards (246) and is tied with Bijan Robinson for the team lead in receptions (21).\nThe Falcons also have tight end Kyle Pitts, their 2021 first-round pick, as a receiving target. Jefferson and Pitts were teammates for two seasons at Florida."}

(4:05)\nFormer NHL coach and player Barry Melrose, who has been an Emmy Award-winning hockey analyst for ESPN since 1996, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and is retiring, he announced Tuesday.\n\"I've had over 50 extraordinary years playing, coaching and analyzing the world's greatest game, hockey. It's now time to hang up my skates and focus on my health, my family, including my supportive wife Cindy, and whatever comes next,\" Melrose, 67, said in a statement.\n\"I'm beyond grateful for my hockey career, and to have called ESPN home for almost 30 years. Thanks for the incredible memories and I'll now be cheering for you from the stands.\"\nBefore joining ESPN in 1996, Melrose served as coach of the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings, taking them to the Stanley Cup Final in the first of his three seasons. He stepped away from the network in 2008 to return to the bench, this time as coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning for 16 games.\nOverall, Melrose had an 84-108-29 record as a head coach.\nBut it was his career as a studio analyst with ESPN where his witty personality, flashy suits and recognizable goatee, slicked-back hair and mullet endeared him to hockey fans worldwide.\n\"He's bigger than any team,\" Gretzky said in a video tribute for ESPN. \"For decades, he's been suiting up -- and I mean suiting up -- for the game, for the sport, for hockey. ...

{"title": "Bedard bags assist, win in 'awesome' NHL debut", "date": "2023-10-11 04:59:07", "text": "Connor Bedard reflects on his winning NHL debut for the Chicago Blackhawks. (1:09)\nPITTSBURGH -- Connor Bedard did everything but score a goal in his NHL debut.\nAnd the Chicago Blackhawks rookie still stole the show.\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft made his much-heralded premiere Tuesday night and lived up to the billing while notching his first NHL point in Chicago's 4-2 win over Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nIf the game outcome was surprising -- the draft lottery-winning Blackhawks used four different scorers to come back from a 2-0 deficit and top the veteran Penguins -- Bedard's smooth transition to the NHL was not. He was in the spotlight right away as the opening faceoff pitted Chicago's 18-year-old phenom against his childhood idol in Crosby, the three-time Stanley Cup champion.\nIt was a quintessential welcome-to-the-NHL-kid moment. The result, however, did not favor Bedard.\n\"[I was] just trying to win it, and I failed miserably,\" he said after the game. \"But it was pretty cool. He's a childhood hero of mine, like I've mentioned. It was a lot of fun.\"\nBedard didn't let the early loss affect his confidence. His on-ice performance already displays what has put him firmly in the generational talent category, and he finished the night with 21:29 ice time (leading all forwards), 5 shots on goal, 11 shot attempts (the second most in an NHL debut since 2009-10) and 1 assist.\nHe became the youngest player to earn a point in a season opener since Aleksander Barkov in 2013, and the second-youngest player in Blackhawks history (after Eddie Olczyk in 1984) to secure a debut point.\nThe only place Bedard underachieved was at the faceoff dot, where he went just 2-for-13. That won't diminish his first experience as an NHL player though, something that, despite months of hype leading up to it, went by too quickly, he noted.\n\"It's a moment you think of all your life,\" he said. \"And now it's already done. That part is kind of sad.\"\nFortunately for Bedard, the memories can last a lifetime.\nHis pedigree didn't preclude him from being immersed in all the usual NHL rookie traditions -- or guard against an apparently nervous pregame moment. Before the Blackhawks went out for warmups, Bedard was caught looking frantically around for his missing stick -- having seemingly forgotten to grab one -- before finally locating one on the equipment rack.\nTurns out Bedard's usual superstition had just been interrupted. Normally he would leave a stick along the wall, blade not touching the ground. But he couldn't find the one he'd prepped, thus the search for another.\nOnce he went down the tunnel, it was Bedard and fellow freshman Kevin Korchinski alone taking the ice for a minute of solo laps before their teammates joined. Neither player wore a helmet -- which are mandatory in warmups for players who entered the league after the 2019-20 season -- but Korchinski said it was other Blackhawks who encouraged the decision, insisting \"you only get one rookie lap.\"\nAnd if anyone could relate to what Bedard was going through Tuesday, it was Korchinski. Bedard might have been hard on himself for not excelling in every aspect of the game on night one, but Korchinski would encourage him to give himself some grace.\n\"Just like the rest of us, he's got stuff he's going to learn from and work on,\" Korchinski said. \"That's the scary thing is he's still learning. He's only 18. He's only going to get better.\"\nBedard seemingly had the same idea and made the most of his ample ice time throughout the game, both at 5-on-5 and with the man advantage. He was a fixture on the Blackhawks' first power-play unit and during their initial attempt helped Chicago hold the zone for more than 90 seconds with a pair of nice keep-ins and a whistling one-timer that didn't make it past Pittsburgh netminder Tristan Jarry.\nWhile Bedard was a clear focal point for the Blackhawks (and, frankly, the Penguins), he wasn't the only one deserving of attention. Chicago used a collective effort to move past Pittsburgh after falling into a 2-0 hole in the second period off goals from Bryan Rust and Crosby. Bedard was on the ice when Crosby scored, and it might have inspired him to get on the scoresheet as well.\nMoments after Crosby's tally, Bedard, who had been buzzing around the net generating his own chances already, picked up his assist on linemate Ryan Donato's score that cut the Pittsburgh lead to 2-1 heading into the third period. Bedard earned his helper, though, with a strong zone entry to set up a prolonged sequence in Pittsburgh's end that allowed Chicago to wear down the Penguins.\nBedard never has had trouble finding the back of a net before. He collected 71 goals and 143 points in 57 games with the Western Hockey League's Regina Pats last season, an encore to the 100-point campaign he produced the year prior. It might be just a matter of time before he's collecting NHL tallies. Taking down the Penguins, though, required Chicago's depth to carry them through.\nOnce Donato opened the floodgates, Chicago poured it on with a goal from Cole Guttman to tie the game at 2, followed by Jason Dickinson's game-winner late in the third period. Nick Foligno added the insurance empty-netter from there. And Petr Mrazek's exceptional 38-save showing gave the Blackhawks every chance to rally back.\n\"It just shows our mindset,\" Bedard said of Chicago's effort. \"We've seen that a lot throughout camp. Guys want to win so badly.\"\nAnd it was the victory Bedard relished most about his debut. The entire game felt like the start of a promising new chapter for Chicago hockey -- which, in every respect, it was.\n\"Coming back like we did, it's awesome for our group,\" Bedard said. \"I think you remember [the night] with a little better taste in your mouth when you win.\""}
{"title": "Astros take G3 with gem from unflappable Javier", "date": "2023-10-11 04:59:07", "text": "Yordan Alvarez continues his red-hot postseason with a deep home run as the Astros take Game 3 over the Twins. (0:30)\nMINNEAPOLIS -- Another stingy October outing from Cristian Javier put the Houston Astros one win away from another American League Championship Series.\nIn his first postseason start since a combined World Series no-hitter last year, Javier limited the Minnesota Twins to one hit over five scoreless innings, and the Astros whacked four home runs in a 9-1 victory at Target Field on Tuesday. Houston grabbed a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five division series and can clinch its seventh consecutive ALCS appearance with a win Wednesday.\nCapitalizing on the shadows cast over the field by the 3 p.m. start, Javier leaned heavily on his slider -- normally difficult to square, positively dastardly with the elements impairing hitters' vision -- and generated 11 swings and misses with the pitch. After a first-inning double by Max Kepler, the 26-year-old Javier navigated the dangerous Twins lineup without allowing further damage. He walked five and struck out nine as he wriggled out of jams in the first, third and fifth innings, the latter of which he punctuated with back-to-back strikeouts of Kepler and Twins cleanup hitter Royce Lewis.\nDuring the first, Twins fans started counting down the pitch clock in unison, an effort to get into Javier's head. For a player whose unflappability is as much a defining feature as his invisible fastball and sneaky slider, the results went about as expected.\n\"I used it in my favor,\" Javier said. \"At that point, I stopped paying attention to the clock because they were counting and just paid attention to the catcher.\"\nHis catcher, veteran Martin Maldonado, smirked at the idea of Javier being thrown off his game.\n\"I think the only way you can rattle him is if you punch him,\" Maldonado said. \"I spent time with him off the field, and that's him. Same thing you guys see on the mound.\"\nEveryone saw a reasonable facsimile of what Javier delivered last October. In Game 3 of the ALCS, his first playoff start, he threw 5⅓ shutout innings and allowed just one hit. Eleven days later, in Game 4 of the World Series, he went six hitless innings, combining with three relievers on just the second no-hitter in World Series history.\nOver his three postseason starts, Javier has held batters to an .040 batting average (2-for-50). He became the fourth pitcher in history with at least three consecutive scoreless starts of five or more innings, joining Hall of Famers Whitey Ford and Christy Mathewson -- who threw complete games in their streaks -- along with Kenny Rogers.\nAstros manager Dusty Baker contemplated yanking Javier, particularly after he walked the bases loaded in the fifth, but gave him the benefit of the doubt.\n\"We had to make a decision on whether to leave him in there or go to somebody else. He came through,\" Baker said. \"He can smell a victory -- or he can smell when I'm about to take him out.\"\nThe team's victory never was in question. First baseman Jose Abreu, in his first season with the Astros, hammered a three-run home run in the first inning off Twins starter Sonny Gray and capped the scoring with a two-run shot in the ninth. In between, the Astros got homers from Alex Bregman and Yordan Alvarez, who now has four in the series.\n\"It was a difficult day to hit,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"So them jumping out early was very, very important. Whichever team did that was going to definitely be in the driver's seat because the game times that we have right now and our ballpark make it very difficult to see the ball.\"\nIt's even tougher with Javier on the mound. While he ran into troubles during his first full season as a starter -- his 4.56 ERA this year was more than two runs higher than last year -- the October version of Javier is impeccable. Especially when his slider is, as he deemed it, \"tremendous. ... I thought it was super good. Thankfully I was able to throw it inside the strike zone. My whole plan was to use it and try to attack.\"\nMinnesota, whose home run-happy offense helped secure an AL Central title, registered a pair of hits off reliever Hunter Brown to score its only run in the sixth. Bryan Abreu, Phil Maton and Rafael Montero held the Twins hitless over the final three innings and combined for five strikeouts.\nThe Twins plan to start Joe Ryan in Game 4, where he'll be opposed by Houston's Jose Urquidy. The bullpens for both teams are expected to play a significant role in the game."}

Here's a chance to catch up on everything that has happened -- the hirings, firings, signings and even a blockbuster trade. It's all in our guide to the 2023-24 season for lapsed fans. Read up before the puck drops on opening night this Tuesday!\nHow to watch the 2023-24 NHL season on ESPN networks -- including 100 exclusive games and the out-of-market package (over 1,050 games).\nThe biggest surprise about the Golden Knights lifting the Stanley Cup might have been that it wasn't the Bruins doing it instead.\nThe 2022-23 Bruins were the most successful regular-season team in NHL history, setting league records for wins (65) and points (135) in a season. The NHL awards confirmed that they had the league's best goalie (Linus Ullmark), best coach (Jim Montgomery) and best defensive forward (Patrice Bergeron), along with a 61-goal scorer in winger David Pastrnak. They were a juggernaut offensively and defensively. The question wasn't if they would win the Stanley Cup, but how long it would take them.\nAnd then they were upset in the first round by the Florida Panthers -- who would go on to face Vegas for the Stanley Cup -- losing at home in a Game 7 overtime that left Boston fans and players in stunned silence.\nIt wasn't just a loss on the ice for the Bruins. The offseason saw Bergeron, their much celebrated No. 1 center and captain, retire after 19 seasons. Their second-best center, David Krejci, retired after 16 seasons. The Bruins had made it their mission to send both of them off as champions. Instead, they have to pick themselves up off the canvas without them.\nThey aren't the only departures from Boston: Wingers Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno, Tyler Bertuzzi and defenseman Dmitry Orlov all switched teams in the offseason, too.\nCan new captain Brad Marchand and the Bruins who remain get back to the playoffs with these lineup holes? Is their defense corps, led by Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm, and goaltending (Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman) dominant enough to contend again? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nIf the Bruins falter, or another of last season's Eastern Conference playoff teams struggles, all eyes are on a trio of Atlantic Division teams that have been rebuilding towards getting back to the playoffs.\nThe Buffalo Sabres have garnered the most interest, having not made the playoffs since 2011. They have a newly minted star center in Tage Thompson and two great young defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.\nThe Ottawa Senators also have a breakout star in forward Tim Stutzle, who joins players like Brad Tkachuk and Claude Giroux in trying to get the Sens their first playoff spot since 2017 under new owner Michael Andlauer.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, who haven't made the playoffs since 2016, hope their mix of established veterans and younger talents finally brings GM Steve Yzerman's plans into sharper focus.\nBedard, 18, is the latest generational talent who had teams, ahem, \"rearranging their rosters\" in order to maximize their draft lottery odds. Chicago had the third-best odds when it won the lottery to secure the services of Bedard, selecting No. 1 overall for the first time since drafting Patrick Kane in 2007.\nThe hockey world had anticipated Bedard's NHL arrival for years. He was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. He racked up player of the year awards and led the Canadian junior team to two gold medals. Scouts have raved about the quality and accuracy of his shot, which produced 122 goals in 119 games over the past two seasons with the Regina Pats. He's unquestionably the most hyped rookie to arrive in the NHL since another Connor: Oilers star and reigning NHL MVP Connor McDavid, who was drafted in 2015.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBedard arrives during a transitional time for Chicago.\nThe Blackhawks' reputation is still on the mend after the 2021 investigation that made public the sexual assault allegations by former player Kyle Beach against the team's video coach Brad Aldrich during the 2010 season. Stan Bowman, the team's GM and president of hockey operations, and senior vice president of hockey operations Al MacIsaac both resigned in the aftermath, with current general manager Kyle Davidson taking over.\nKane and captain Jonathan Toews, the last on-ice links to the Blackhawks' three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, 2015), both parted ways with the franchise last season. In July, Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz died at 70 years old following an illness.\nBedard's arrival has certainly helped change the vibes for the Blackhawks.\nThe team sold $5.2 million worth of tickets after winning the draft lottery. The Blackhawks tell ESPN that they expect an increase of over 17% in tickets sold and overall 26% higher revenue growth than our initial 2023-24 season projections. They've nearly doubled their full season-ticket packages sold year over year.\nChicago hasn't made the playoffs in three seasons and probably won't again in Bedard's first season -- although the Blackhawks bolstered their rebuilding lineup with familiar names like Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. But they theoretically have their next franchise player and, more importantly, a point of demarcation with the past.\nBedard is far from the only notable first-year player in the NHL this season. In a league that's all about speed, scoring and low salary cap hits, more young players than ever are breaking into the NHL early. Some other rookies to watch this season:\nLogan Cooley had announced he was returning to the University of Minnesota, but instead the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 signed with the Arizona Coyotes ... where he will still play in an NCAA arena this season, but we digress.\nCenter Adam Fantilli, 18, was selected third overall in the 2023 draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets after being projected as the second-best prospect behind Bedard all season. (No. 2 overall was Leo Carlsson of the Anaheim Ducks.) The University of Michigan product won the Hobey Baker as the best men's player in the NCAA last season.\nAnother Michigan alum is defenseman Luke Hughes, who brought some chaotic energy to the New Jersey Devils' playoff run. He's expected to be an offensive force this season on a team that features his brother, star center Jack Hughes.\nGoalie Devon Levi could be entrusted by the Sabres to lead them to their first playoff berth since 2011. He dazzled in a brief stint with them last season.\nThe Maple Leafs made winger Matthew Knies untouchable at the trade deadline last season, and for good reason: The Hobey Baker finalist from Minnesota brings offensive skill and physicality in his game.\nKyle Dubas bet on himself as general manager of the Maple Leafs, entering last season without a contract beyond 2022-23. He seemingly won the wager, as the Leafs advanced past the opening round for the first time since 2004 by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning before losing to the Panthers.\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nBut as Dubas' agent and team president Brendan Shanahan worked on a new contract, there was drama brewing. The ask from Dubas went up, and reportedly so did the amount of power he wanted in personnel decisions. Dubas held a news conference that didn't sit well with Shanahan, saying his future in Toronto required \"a full family discussion.\" Ultimately, Shanahan decided to let Dubas walk, hiring former Calgary GM Brad Treliving as his replacement.\nDubas also made it seem like it was Toronto or bust in that news conference, saying, \"I definitely don't have it in me to go anywhere else.\" Then the Penguins came calling after they fired team president Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall and ... well, maybe Pittsburgh isn't like anywhere else.\nDubas was named president of hockey operations and oversaw a search for the team's next general manager before finding the perfect candidate: Kyle Dubas, who will serve in that role for the foreseeable future. The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins, tasked him with two missions: Start thinking about what the next phase of this team looks like while doing everything he can to help the team's veteran core -- Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang -- become Stanley Cup champions for a fourth time since 2009.\nHis first move was a bit of managerial magic: a three-team trade that saw him move out some of the team's cap-problematic contracts while acquiring 33-year-old San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson, who won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman last season. Karlsson scored 101 points in 82 games. Another season like that, and the Penguins might have one more championship push left in them.\nBesides the Karlsson trade, there were other significant trades in the offseason:\nThe Los Angeles Kings acquired center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Winnipeg Jets in a package that included forwards Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi. A 25-year-old restricted free agent, Dubois was handed an eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois gives the Kings one of the deepest groups at center in the West, along with Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault.\nThe Devils, who defeated the New York Rangers for their first playoff series win since 2012, traded for winger Tyler Toffoli, who led the Calgary Flames with 34 goals last season.\nThe Avalanche acquired center Ryan Johansen from the Nashville Predators, who picked up half of his $8 million cap hit for the next two seasons to facilitate the trade.\nAfter scoring winger Alex DeBrincat made it clear that he wouldn't re-sign with the Senators, they sent him to the Red Wings in a trade that included a first-round pick and forward Dominik Kubalik.\nThe Blue Jackets added two veteran defensemen via trade, acquiring Ivan Provorov (Flyers) and Damon Severson (Devils). Severson received an eight-year, $50 million contract extension.\nThe St. Louis Blues benefited from the Philadelphia Flyers' salary dump, as they traded a sixth-round pick for center Kevin Hayes and had Philly pick up 50% of his salary for the remaining three years of the deal.\nSome interesting names ended up in even more interesting locations via free agency:\nThe NHL had a buyout window that was more active than usual. The players changing teams after having the remaining years on their contracts bought out included Jets captain Blake Wheeler, now with the Rangers; Predators center Matt Duchene, who signed with the Stars; winger Josh Bailey, who was traded to Chicago by the New York Islanders after 15 seasons, bought out by the Blackhawks, and then signed a professional tryout contract with the Senators; defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who was bought out by Vancouver and signed with the Panthers; and defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who now has the honor of being bought out by two different teams, with the Flyers ending his time in Philadelphia so he could rejoin the Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Bruins saw their two big trade deadline acquisitions move on. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, who were already stacked on defense, and Tyler Bertuzzi signed a one-year deal to play on Auston Matthews' wing with the Maple Leafs. Michael Bunting, who played with Matthews last season, signed with the Hurricanes. The Leafs also signed free agent defenseman John Klingberg to a one-year deal.\nStar center Ryan O'Reilly, who was picked up at the trade deadline by Toronto, surprised many by signing a four-year deal with the Predators.\nGoalie Joonas Korpisalo, one of the only big-name goalies available as free agency opened, inked a five-year contract with the Senators.\nWinger Alex Killorn, an essential role player on Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup teams, signed a four-year deal with the Ducks after 11 seasons with the Lightning.\nDefenseman Matt Dumba was cap-squeezed out of Minnesota and signed a one-year deal with the Coyotes.\nWinger James van Riemsdyk, defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and winger Milan Lucic all signed with the Bruins. It's a homecoming for Lucic, who was a fan favorite during eight years in Boston (2007-15).\nWinger Vladimir Tarasenko didn't find the deal he wanted in free agency, changed agents and then inked a one-year contract with the Senators.\nAmong the players who avoided free agency by re-signing with their teams are two Golden Knights playoff heroes in forward Ivan Barbashev (five years) and goalie Adin Hill (two years); goalie Tristan Jarry, who signed a five-year deal to stay with the Penguins; defenseman Scott Mayfield (seven years), who remained with the Islanders; goalies Frederik Andersen (two years) and Antti Raanta (one year), who stayed with the Hurricanes; and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who remained with the Kings on a two-year deal.\nOne name still available as the season begins: Patrick Kane, who split last season with the Blackhawks and Rangers before undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in the summer. He plans to play in 2023-24 and is waiting to see what the standings look like as the season progresses.\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews ended any speculation about his pending 2024 free agency by signing a four-year contract extension in August that gave him the highest annual average salary since the NHL instituted the cap: $13.25 million, topping the record Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon set in 2022 ($12.6 million).\nOther significant contract extensions included Devils forwards Jesper Bratt (eight years, $7.875 million AAV) and Timo Meier (eight years, $8.8 million AAV); Ducks forwards Troy Terry (seven years, $7 million AAV) and Trevor Zegras (three years, $5.75 million AAV); Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson (eight years, $8.05 million AAV); Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson (seven years, $6.5 million AAV); Red Wings winger Alex DeBrincat (four years, $7.875 million AAV); Hurricanes center Sebastian Aho (eight years, $9.75 million AAV); and Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin (eight years, $8.25 million AAV).\nThe situation between Mike Babcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets presented an existential question for hockey fans: Is it really a coaching change if a new coach never actually makes it to training camp?\nBabcock was officially hired by the Blue Jackets in July on a two-year deal worth $4 million per season, to much fanfare from the team.\nHe had won a Stanley Cup with Detroit, two Olympic golds with Team Canada, and is 12th all-time with 700 wins. But after he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, stories emerged about Babcock's mental abuse of players with the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. His tactics would be under scrutiny as he returned to the NHL.\nOn the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast in September, former NHL player and current TV analyst Paul Bissonnette claimed that Babcock asked Columbus captain Boone Jenner to show him his cellphone camera roll before displaying those photos via AirPlay on the coach's office wall.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nFormer NHL defenseman Mike Commodore, who played for Babcock and has been a long-standing critic of the coach, said he heard this behavior also occurred during Babcock's time coaching the Maple Leafs.\n\"It happened with a few other players in Columbus, too,\" Commodore said in a video posted to X. \"I don't want to use any names, but in particular [it involved] a young, very highly touted prospect.\"\nThese claims were enough to spark an NHLPA investigation of the situation, as new executive director Marty Walsh interviewed Blue Jackets players in Columbus. The NHLPA then presented its findings to the NHL, and the two entities informed the Blue Jackets. On Sept. 17, Babcock resigned as head coach of the Blue Jackets days before the start of training camp, with associate coach Pascal Vincent taking over as head coach.\n\"Upon reflection, it has become clear that continuing as head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets was going to be too much of a distraction,\" Babcock said in a statement released by the team.\nBlue Jackets management took the blame for the debacle. \"We went through a process earlier this summer prior to hiring Mike Babcock as our head coach, but we got it wrong and that's on us,\" team president John Davidson said.\nIn other less contentious NHL coaching moves, the Capitals parted ways with Peter Laviolette, who quickly found a new gig coaching the Rangers after they fired Gerard Gallant. The Capitals hired 44-year-old Leafs assistant Spencer Carbery. The Predators hired Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette, who was a Jack Adams finalist in 2022 with Florida. Ryan Huska replaced Darryl Sutter in Calgary, while Greg Cronin took over for Dallas Eakins in Anaheim.\nThe NHL has three outdoor games scheduled for the 2023-24 season:\nThe Oilers and Flames play at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL Edmonton Elks, in the Heritage Classic on Oct. 29.\nThe Kraken host the Golden Knights in the 2024 Winter Classic at T-Mobile Stadium, home the Seattle Mariners, on Jan. 1.\nMetLife Stadium -- which saw both a Taylor Swift concert and Taylor Swift, Chiefs fan, this year -- hosts another historic event in February 2024. The Devils will host the Flyers on Saturday, Feb. 17, in an outdoor night game. The Islanders will host the Rangers on Sunday, Feb. 18. The event will mark the first time four NHL teams have played outdoor games at the same venue in front of fans.\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend will be held on Feb. 2 and 3 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\nThe 26-year-old Edmonton star set new career highs with 64 goals and 153 points in 82 games last season, winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP for the third time and the Pearson Award for NHLPA player of the year for a fourth time. His point total jumped by 30 and his goals by 20 year over year. No one's really sure what his ceiling is statistically.\nUnfortunately for McDavid and his superstar teammate Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers have had a ceiling in the playoffs. After losing in the conference finals last season, Edmonton fell to the Golden Knights in the second round this season. McDavid and Draisaitl have yet to play for a Stanley Cup since McDavid entered the league in 2015. Is this the year?\nWhile teams like the Avalanche, Golden Knights, Lightning, Penguins and Kings seek another championship after recently winning the Cup, other teams considered among the top contenders are seeking to end significant droughts.\nThe Hurricanes (2006), Devils (2003), Stars (1999), Rangers (1994) and Oilers (1990) all have gone well over a decade without hoisting hockey's grail, while teams like the Minnesota Wild and Panthers have never won the Cup.\nAnd then there are the Maple Leafs, seeking their first Stanley Cup win since 1967 -- a 55-season drought that's the longest in the NHL.\nFinally, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin continues his journey to break one of the most seemingly unbreakable records in sports: Wayne Gretzky's 894 career NHL goals.\nAfter tallying 42 goals in 2022-23, Ovechkin has 822 career goals at the start the season. That's 72 goals to tie and 73 goals to pass Gretzky. So while the record-breaking moment probably has to wait until at least next season, it'll be fun to see how close Ovechkin can position himself to it during 2023-24.\nUnless he decides to score 73 goals and be done with it. We're never one to underestimate Mr. Ovechkin as a goal scorer."}
{"title": "Makhachev-Volkanosvki 2: UFC 294 has a new main event with just days to spare...now what?", "date": "2023-10-11 05:45:26", "text": "Islam Makhachev wins a thriller vs. Alexander Volkanovski to retain his UFC lightweight title at UFC 284. (1:15)\nWhen one rematch falls, another one rises.\nAlexander Volkanovski will step in for Charles Oliveira to face current lightweight champion Islam Makhachev for the 155-pound title at UFC 294 in Abu Dhabi. Oliveira, who first fought Makhachev and lost at UFC 280 last year, was severely cut above his eye during training and was forced to pull out of the main event rematch on Oct. 21.\nNow, on just 11 days notice, Volkanovski will get in on the rematch action and attempt to take down Makhachev and become a two-division champion. Volkanovski lost in a five-round thriller to Makhachev at UFC 284 in February 2023\nMarc Raimondi deep dives into the implications of the main event title change and hits on whether this puts Makhachev or Volkanovski in a more disadvantaged position going into their second bout.\nIt's surely a risk. I won't go as far as to say it's a mistake. Volkanovski is supremely confident and has already been there with Makhachev for five rounds. Had this been their first fight, one could imagine Volkanovski hesitating if this kind of opportunity arose. But now he knows what he's in for. He's felt Makhachev's strength, wrestling skill and power. I will say this, though: Volkanovski has a ton of guts for taking this fight without a training camp. If he loses at UFC 294, who knows if he gets another crack at the lightweight title?\nThis is an interesting question, because conventional wisdom says the fighter coming in on short notice with no training camp is at a disadvantage. But I've talked to plenty of coaches who say it could be the opposite - the banged-up fighter who's been training for six or eight weeks going against a \"fresh\" opponent they have not prepared for is the one at a deficit. Ultimately, though, it's not a mistake for Makhachev. He's the bigger man, has already beaten Volkanovski, and though he's been training for a different style of fight, he still has the wrestling and grappling to neutralize anyone.\nHe heals up that cut and waits. Maybe he even gets a title shot next year in Brazil out of this. Who knows? Oliveira is still the No. 1 contender. He has to be concerned that Justin Gaethje, who knocked out Dustin Poirier to win the BMF title in July, is also right there. Oliveira still figures to be next in line, but what if Volkanovski wins and defends the featherweight title before the lightweight one? Could Oliveira have to fight and win again to get another chance at the belt? Anything is possible. The UFC is a fast-moving world.\nIt's as simple as Volkanovski represents the biggest possible fight - even bigger than Oliveira, theoretically - and he was available and willing. We at ESPN have Volkanovski ranked No. 1 pound-for-pound in the world. Makhachev is No. 2. As Dana White said Tuesday night, it's maybe the most anticipated rematch in division history. And that covers some ground. Lightweight is a premier division. The UFC did make overtures to others, including Mateusz Gamrot and Dustin Poirier, according to sources, but Volkanovski was the best possible option.\nAlexander Volkanovski forces the referee to stop the fight vs. Yair Rodriguez in Round 3 of the UFC 290 main event.\nIlia Topuria is the No. 1 contender. That much is clear. Who Topuria fights and when will be questioned if Volkanovski becomes the UFC lightweight champion. Volkanovski may come out of the Makhachev fight relatively early and want to move back down and defend the featherweight belt in his next fight. Volkanovski told me earlier this year that he's confident he could be a fighting champion in two divisions if it came to that.\nThe UFC could also pull the trigger on an interim title fight, like they did earlier this year when Volkanovski fought Makhachev for the first time. Topuria vs. Max Holloway for interim gold could be an interesting move. Before the last few days, Volkanovski vs. Topuria at UFC 297 in January was deep in negotiations and likely to happen, per sources.\nVolkanovski comes back down at some point and defends the title. The UFC could still end up doing an interim title fight. It'll all come down to timing.\nCould Volkanovski make a quick turn and defend the 145-pound belt early in 2024? Potentially, but it seems like it would be a lot to ask. An interim title fight, whether Volkanovski wins or loses, is probably a safe bet at this point."}
{"title": "'This team is on the rise': Why Baltimore still has plenty to celebrate", "date": "2023-10-11 05:48:36", "text": "ARLINGTON -- The looks on the faces of those 46,000 Baltimore Orioles fans as they quietly exited Camden Yards on Sunday after a discouraging loss to the Rangers was not one of anger, but of sadness. The fans of Baltimore -- a provincial town, a brick town, a neighborhood town -- had waited almost a decade to celebrate the return of October baseball after such a painful rebuild. Instead, 11 walks later, a giant orange mass of people walked into the darkness in stunned silence.\nThe 11-8 loss -- it was 9-2 in the third inning -- dropped the Orioles into a 2-0 hole in the best-of-five American League Division Series against Texas, with the series heading to Arlington. And considering the magic with which the relentless Texas Rangers have been playing in this postseason, many of those fans sensed there would be no more baseball this season at Camden Yards.\nThey were right. The Orioles lost 7-1 in Game 3 on Tuesday, ending the season and marking the first time since star catcher Adley Rutschman debuted on May 21, 2022, that the Orioles had been swept in a series of any length. But yet when the season ended Tuesday night at Globe Life Field, the Orioles clubhouse was not in stunned silence. It was awash in the feeling that a still remarkable season just didn't end as expected.\nDid manager Brandon Hyde view it as a successful season?\n\"How can I not?'' he said. \"We won 101 games. We won the East. We defied the odds. No one gave us a chance. We played really well all season.''\nAnd they did: Two years after finishing 39 games out of fourth place, the second team ever to finish that far behind the next-worst team in a league or division, the Orioles swiftly revitalized baseball in Baltimore with swashbuckling style of play: young, hungry and athletic players who pushed the action every night, on the bases, at the plate and on the mound. They had the best record in the American League two years after having the worst record, joining the 1967-69 Mets as the only two teams in major league history to win 100 games in the same three-year period in which they lost 100 games. The fans thought the momentum might carry the Orioles to the AL Championship Series, and maybe the World Series.\n\"It didn't end the way that we wanted, but it was a special season,'' said outfielder Austin Hays, who had endured a lot of losing before the Orioles broke through last year. \"It was fun, it was the most fun I've ever seen a team have. That first playoff game at Camden Yards was amazing.''\nWe've got you covered on all things October baseball.\nSchedule, bracket, standings »\nWorld Series odds, LDS preview »\nOur predictions for every round »\nBut then they ran into a Rangers team that is more experienced in October, has a payroll nearly $150 million more than that of the Orioles and was playing exceptionally well at the most optimum time.\n\"We made great development all year,'' rookie shortstop Gunnar Henderson said. \"This was a good step in the right direction. This is going to fuel us for next season. We've got to get better to make a World Series push.''\nCompared to many of the other 2023 postseason squads, the Orioles were just young and inexperienced for October, though Hyde refused to blame those attributes -- \"Our guys just play.'' And despite another round of questions about whether the five days off between the end of the regular season and the beginning of the postseason are good or bad for a top seed, Hyde refused to blame that, either. To stay sharp, the Orioles played two intersquad games, one of which was open to the public -- about 2,000 fans showed up.\nStill, the Orioles looked young and rusty against the Rangers, nothing like the team that had a winning record every month of the season (other than 0-1 in October). The Orioles lost the opener 4-3 with their best pitcher, Kyle Bradish, against Andrew Heaney, who had thrown 15 innings in the past 32 days. Orioles pitchers struck out 16, allowing the Rangers to become only the second team in postseason history to win a nine-inning game in which they struck out 16 times. The Rangers were the first team in postseason history to have their No. 3 hitter (Robbie Grossman) and No. 4 hitter (Adolis Garcia) each strike out four times in the same game. But the Orioles didn't get a hit with a runner in scoring position. Down a run in the eighth inning against a beleaguered bullpen, the Orioles had runners on first and second with none out -- and didn't score. They got the leadoff man on in each of the last three innings and didn't score.\nThe Orioles' ninth inning also brought confusion. Henderson singled to start the inning. On a 2-1 pitch to veteran outfielder Aaron Hicks, Henderson was thrown out trying to steal thanks in part to a great exchange and throw by Rangers catcher Jonah Heim. Hyde was caught on TV cameras saying, \"What the f---!?'' After the game, Hyde called it \"a little miscommunication.'' Henderson said, \"I saw the steal sign.''\nThe next day, Hyde confirmed, \"[Hicks] missed a hit-and-run sign on a hittable pitch.''\nTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nKurkjian: From raw to really, really good »\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more »\nAs badly as Game 1 ended, Game 2 started even worse. The Orioles' Grayson Rodriguez, one of the best young pitchers in the game, didn't get through the second inning, allowing four walks and five runs. The Rangers' Mitch Garver hit a grand slam in the third inning and suddenly the Rangers had a 9-2 lead. The sellout crowd, which was so loud, so joyous when the playoffs began, was suddenly hushed. The Orioles would rally, but the final score, 11-8, was misleading. Baltimore pitchers walked 11 batters, one shy of the major league record for a postseason game.\nIn Game 3, another five-run second inning for the Rangers blew it open, essentially ending a magical season. The Orioles became the fourth team in history to fail to win a playoff game in a season in which they won 100 games, joining the 1971 A's, '76 Phillies, '80 Yankees and 2019 Twins. It was indeed a deflating way to end a season, but the 2023 season cannot be viewed as a disappointment for the Orioles, not the way it would be for, say, the Dodgers or Braves, who entered the season with enormous expectations. It should be viewed as a building block, a learning experience, for a team that's likely going to be in the postseason for years to come. In the last two years, the Orioles have gone ahead of schedule in their rebuild, jumping from 52 wins to 83 in 2022, then from 83 to 101 in 2023. It is so difficult to make a huge leap like last season's -- it's harder to make another vault the next year.\nThe Orioles did both, and even now their future is exceptionally bright. Henderson, who will win the AL Rookie of the Year, \"will be a star in this league for 15 years,'' Hyde said. Rutschman is one of the best catchers in the game, and likely will only get better. Outfielder Heston Kjerstad, who was on the playoff roster, \"can mash,'' Hyde said. Outfielder Colton Cowser, third baseman Coby Mayor and infielder Joey Ortiz are among the many prospects in the system. The best player in all of minor league baseball is perhaps 19-year-old Jackson Holliday, who might be the Orioles' everyday shortstop next year (moving Henderson to third base): Imagine that left side of the infield for the next five to 10 years.\nRodriguez, with tremendous stuff and great maturity, is a star in the making. Bradish has a 2.81 ERA over his past 38 starts, and this year became the first Oriole since Mike Mussina in 1992 to finish in the top three in ERA. John Means, the ace of the staff in 2021, pitched effectively at the end of the season after returning from Tommy John surgery. Next year, the bullpen will be without Felix Bautista, who had Tommy John surgery in August; losing him during a pennant race was a huge setback. Still, there are power arms in the pen. Left-hander DL Hall emerged as a reliable reliever this season. And more pitching is on the way.\n\"This isn't a fluke,'' Hays said. \"This team is on the rise.''\n\"This,'' Henderson said, \"is just a shadow of what we're capable of.''\nWhen next season arrives, the Orioles likely will be the team to beat in the AL East. They will still be young, hungry and athletic, but more experienced than the team that finished 2023. And when those fans arrive at Camden Yards on Opening Day 2024, they should be thrilled about the direction the team is headed. It will be a happy day, not a sad one."}
{"title": "'It's just very unique': Sidney Crosby's advice for Connor Bedard", "date": "2023-10-11 05:55:22", "text": "Sidney Crosby and Connor Bedard sit down and chat ahead of Bedard's NHL debut when the Blackhawks take on the Penguins. (2:45)\nAhead of Sidney Crosby's rookie debut in 2005, he felt the weight of the NHL on his shoulders. The league was coming off a yearlong lockout. The team that drafted him No. 1, the Pittsburgh Penguins, was in such peril that it was exploring relocation. The hype surrounding the 18-year-old Crosby was insane; he was already a hockey icon before stepping on NHL ice.\nCrosby returned home from his first NHL morning skate and did something he rarely does: He botched his pregame nap.\n\"I didn't sleep at all,\" Crosby said in an interview last month at the NHL media tour in Las Vegas. \"It's just like, you're almost there, and you're so excited, anxious, nervous. There's all these different emotions you're feeling. Nothing can prepare you for that. You have no idea what to expect. The [media] scrums, the buildup and all the stuff leading up to it, and you still haven't played a game. So you almost felt like you shouldn't be talking about it because you haven't played yet. And knowing your family's going to be there, and everything that led up to playing your first game, you have all these snapshots going through your mind.\"\nHow to watch the NHL on ESPN, ABC, ESPN+ and Hulu\nGame 1 didn't go as Crosby imagined. The Devils won 5-1. Crosby assisted on the lone Pittsburgh goal, the first of 102 points in his rookie season -- which kick-started a career that somehow exceeded expectations. Now, at 36 -- with three Stanley Cups and two Hart Trophies and on the cusp of breaking into the NHL's top 10 scoring list -- he's able to reminisce.\n\"Trying to manage all that, you're young, and you haven't gone through stuff like that,\" Crosby said. \"Looking back at it, I look at it as a fun experience. It wasn't something that was bad. It's just very unique.\"\nCROSBY'S 19th SEASON in the league will begin with the same level of fanfare -- for his opponent. The Penguins open on Tuesday (8 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN+) against the Chicago Blackhawks, featuring No. 1 pick Connor Bedard, anointed as the next face of the league. Sid the Kid aged into a role where he now plays against the kids who grew up idolizing him.\nCrosby feels comfortable enough in himself to take on the role of mentor. In Las Vegas, Crosby agreed to do the first portion of media interviews alongside Bedard -- dispensing some insight, while also allowing the teenager to learn from example.\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC. More than 1,050 out-of-market games will be available to ESPN+ subscribers via NHL PowerPlay on ESPN+.\n• How to watch \n• Subscribe to ESPN+ \n• Stream the NHL on ESPN\nCrosby had two pieces of advice: Try to enjoy the experience. And learn when to say no.\n\"The new stuff is what comes off the ice, whether it's media or just commitments that come with that. And I think he'll figure it out, but it's hard to say no early on. You're trying to balance so much, and at some point, you might get tired, or it might be taking away from things,\" Crosby said. \"There's going to be a lot of demands off the ice. There's high enough expectations when it comes to on the ice.\"\nIt's already been eye-opening to Bedard, who -- before he even got to training camp -- told ESPN: \"I mean, I'd be so sick of myself if I was a fan. I think there's been so much stuff on me.\"\nBut the rookie is taking notes from Crosby on how to handle the extra attention.\n\"He talks to everyone he passes by and takes his time with everyone,\" Bedard said. \"He's the pinnacle of that, of carrying himself. Of course, on the ice everyone knows how great he is. But I think off the ice and how he handles things there is just as special.\n\"I mean, of course I want to ask him a lot of questions. But you don't want to be too annoying. And [so I asked him] just kinda some simple stuff about the league. Nothing really that wild.\"\nAspects of Bedard's game impress Crosby, beginning with the teenager's shot. Crosby also noted the Blackhawks rookie's competitiveness. \"You can see when the stakes are high,\" Crosby said. \"He's always raised his game.\"\nCrosby kept his advice strictly off-ice. Because if there's one thing you need to know about Crosby in this iteration: He's never been hungrier to win.\nTHE PENGUINS MISSED the playoffs last season for the first time in 17 years, and it absolutely grated at Crosby. Those close to the Penguins captain said he never talked about the silver lining of having a long summer and more time for recovery. It was only about finding ways to improve.\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\n\"When it comes to a lot of different skills, that's just constantly learning,\" Crosby said. \"Things that you do well one year maybe don't come as easy the next year for whatever reason, whether it's you or just the way things have kind of happened. So, identifying those things, not being too hard on yourself when things don't go well, knowing that's the process. It's a long season. And that just comes with experience.\"\nAs with the advice he gave Bedard, Crosby has figured out over the years what works for him. The NHL's annual player media tour was in part created because of Crosby. He wanted to do less off-ice stuff during camp, so the league and Crosby's camp brainstormed a one-stop event to be more economical with his time.\nIt was a collaboration between the league and Crosby's camp, and the star Crosby has attended the event for 16 consecutive Septembers, whereas it's not uncommon for other star players to pass in any given year.\nFor several years, Crosby also held an invitation-only end-of-offseason training camp for a handful of players in Vail. Crosby loved the ramp-up in Colorado, where he could test himself at altitude. Although Crosby now attends BioSteel Camp instead, because that's where his longtime trainer Andy O'Brien is, he's considering reviving the Vail camp in the future.\nSince his rookie season, Crosby has been nothing but consistent. He's been a point-per-game player in every season of his 18-year career. His faceoff percentage over his first two seasons (51.36%) is nearly identical to that of the past two seasons (52.73%). And last season Crosby took more faceoffs than any other player in the NHL.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Barnwell ranks the NFL's worst teams »\n• Stacking CFB teams with No. 1 case »\n• 10 college basketball recruits to know »\n More ESPN+ content »\nIn some ways he's getting better with age. Crosby scored more game-winning goals over the past two seasons (18) than in any other two-year span in his career.\nBut Crosby has also been forced to adapt, as he has lost some of his quickness with age. Over the past several years, Crosby has relied more on his hockey IQ -- finding the \"quiet spaces\" of where the puck is going to be. But he doesn't cheat for his offense. Instead, Crosby has focused on becoming even more defensively responsible. The center got his first top-five Selke Trophy finish in his age-31 season.\nCrosby has two seasons remaining on his contract. Those close to Crosby say that although he is curious about many things, he never talks beyond vague terms of what he'd like to do when he retires. He's too dialed in on what's right in front of him.\n\"I think when you stop having fun, it's probably time,\" Crosby said. \"So, I'm still having fun, and there's different challenges, different motivations. When that spark isn't there, that fire isn't burning, then it's probably time to put 'em away.\"\nOne thing Crosby is sure of: how he'd like to be remembered.\n\"Just that I competed hard, that I was a good teammate, dependable every night, someone that didn't take it for granted,\" Crosby said. \"And I think you want to be known as a winner. Someone that, when stakes were high, you showed up and were at your best.\""}
{"title": "Can Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs solve the Kadarius Toney puzzle?", "date": "2023-10-11 11:35:01", "text": "Tyler Fulghum is betting over on the Chiefs' team total and will use Kansas City in teasers against the Broncos in Week 6. (0:37)\nAS THE FOURTH quarter of Super Bowl LVII neared 11 minutes, Kadarius Toney fielded a punt at his own 37-yard line while the Kansas City Chiefs held a 28-27 lead over the Philadelphia Eagles. Toney was surrounded by seven Eagles and had seemingly no way out of trouble.\nAfter taking a hit, Toney regained his balance and found one. He reversed field and eventually made his way down the opposite sideline to complete the Super Bowl-record 65-yard punt return that set up the Chiefs for their final touchdown of the game.\nThe play made apparent the talent the Chiefs saw in Toney when they traded for him ahead of last year's deadline. But this season has so far highlighted why the New York Giants were so willing to trade Toney in the first place.\nToney tore his meniscus during a kick return drill moments before the Chiefs were to begin their first training camp practice. He had surgery and made it back for the season's first game against the Detroit Lions, and his play was the story of the game: He dropped several passes, including one he deflected to a defender who returned it for a touchdown in a game the Chiefs lost by one point.\nAlmost a year after dealing for him, the Chiefs are no closer than the Giants were to solving the riddle of Toney. Is he the game-breaker who delivered the big play and scored a fourth-quarter touchdown in the Super Bowl or the injury-prone player who is liable for the 1-yard game he had against Detroit?\n\"He's not maybe your every-down wide receiver with pure fundamentals,\" said Dan Mullen, who coached Toney at Florida. \"I don't know that he's going to ever be a No. 1 receiver. That's not his style of play. But he can be that guy in the return game and the screen game and all of these other things you can do with him.\n\"You get him the ball and you can see what happens. He's a weapon you'd love to have on your team, and there's nobody better than Andy in finding different ways to isolate people and getting them the ball and utilize their talents.\"\nTHE CHIEFS HAD chased Toney for a year and a half before finally finishing the job last year. They hoped to maneuver into position to draft him in 2021 but failed when the Giants picked him in the first round. They tried trading for him in spring 2022 but couldn't come to an agreement then with the Giants.\nAll along, it was clear the Chiefs thought a lot of Toney. He caught 70 passes in his final season at Florida, ran a scorching 4.39 40-yard dash at his pro day and had an unusual ability to change direction in the open field and make defenders miss, as he showed on his Super Bowl punt return.\n\"He's really good,\" Chiefs general manager Brett Veach said. \"He can do anything. He's predominately been a guy that is a slot receiver, returner, runner, gadget guy if you will, but I don't know if there is a limit on his game because he has a vertical game.\n\"He was a first-round pick for a reason. There's a reason why we traded for him.\"\nAfter losing two of last season's top wide receivers, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Mecole Hardman, in free agency, Toney seemed this year to be in a perfect spot to become Mahomes' new favorite target.\nThrough five games, Toney has 14 catches for 83 yards, averaging 5.9 yards per catch. He has not found the end zone. He is eighth on the team in receiving yards, behind running back Isiah Pacheco.\n\"I told coach, I told Pat, I told all the guys, 'That's on me,'\" Toney said. \"At the end of the day, you all count on me and rely on me to make certain plays and I've got to be there to do that.'\n\"There [isn't] really [any] excuse.\"\nTONEY'S STINT WITH the Giants was doomed from the day he first set foot in the building in spring 2021. He pulled himself out of his first rookie minicamp practice to adjust his shoe and did not return.\nOne team source later told ESPN that Toney's cleats were the wrong size and had caused discomfort because they were too tight. The source said Toney started to wear socks once he arrived in the NFL, something he hadn't done in college, and they did not fit inside his cleats. And that was just the beginning.\nToney didn't show up to voluntary OTAs while he and the Giants worked out his rookie contract. Then came the hamstring, ankle, quad, oblique and knee injuries. Toney also had a pair of bouts with COVID-19. By the time all was said and done, he had missed 12 of a possible 24 games with the Giants through a season and a half.\nToney constantly objected to the idea that he was unhappy about playing time or that he was injury prone, despite vague social media posts that suggested otherwise.\nIn his most productive game in a Big Blue uniform (vs. Dallas on Oct. 10, 2021) he didn't make it to the finish line. Toney was ejected for throwing a punch in the fourth quarter after hauling in 10 catches on 13 targets for 189 yards while making defenders look silly trying to tackle him.\nWith all this on his résumé, general manager Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll decided Toney didn't fit the culture they were trying to build in their first season in New York.\nToney was drafted by the previous GM and coach, Dave Gettleman and Joe Judge. One former Giants assistant thought Toney could blossom into the \"best receiver in the league.\"\nIt never happened in New York. Schoen traded Toney prior to the deadline because he knew Toney's value could continue to diminish below the third- and sixth-round picks the Giants received from the Chiefs, especially if he missed more games because of injury (which he eventually did).\nThe Giants had lost trust in Toney. It dated back to the arrival of the new leadership in the 2022 offseason, when they didn't know what the talented wide receiver was doing in regards to his training/rehab in the offseason. By the time the draft came around several months later, other teams were under the impression that Toney's services could be had for the right price, even though Schoen insisted he never \"shopped\" the talented receiver.\nWhen Toney joined the Giants in spring 2022, he hurt his knee on the first day of offseason workouts and needed to have a procedure. He again spent the rest of the spring and most of the summer on the sideline\nToney was active in Weeks 1 and 2, logging two catches for 0 yards, but reinjured his hamstring in the Week 2 win over the Carolina Panthers and that sidelined him for Weeks 3 and 4.\nToney then injured his left hamstring in practice ahead of Week 5, saying the injury to his left hamstring was likely a result of trying to return too quickly from the previous injuries to his right hamstring.\nSchoen and the Giants weren't sure Toney would stay for treatment through the Giants' Week 9 bye. So they jumped at the Chiefs' offer, which came several weeks before the actual trade deadline.\nThe Giants used the third-round pick to trade for tight end Darren Waller. The sixth-round selection turned into cornerback Tre Hawkins III, who was the surprise of Giants training camp and has appeared in four games this season.\nIT'S NOT TOO late for Toney to become the player the Chiefs long envisioned. The Chiefs have seven wide receivers, but none has played consistently well this season. Tight end Travis Kelce is the team's leading receiver.\nIn any case, the Chiefs have no receiver quite like Toney.\n\"He brings energy,\" Kelce said. \"I think his ability speaks for itself. He's very quick, can put his foot in the ground with the best of them. And he's special with the ball in his hands. He's one of those guys where his awareness is crazy. You think he's got eyes in the back of his head because he sees guys coming from different angles and stuff.\n\"He's electric. ... He was that piece for us in the Super Bowl and he was that piece for us through the year last year.\"\n• Can Chiefs solve the Kadarius Toney puzzle?\n• How Jim Schwartz transformed Browns D\n• 49ers receivers block before catching passes\n• Seahawks trends: Run D, Smith-Njigba\n• Texans 'very close' to getting Pierce on track\n• 15 catches?! How Chase set Bengals record\nToney has been with Mahomes for almost a full season. But they've rarely had dedicated practice time together. Training camp is the best time for that. Toney was in camp with the Giants last year and didn't practice at camp this year after having the meniscus surgery.\nThe Chiefs are hopeful that playing with a quarterback like Mahomes can expand Toney's game.\n\"I don't know if [the Giants] were a team that really vertically pushed the ball down the field,\" Veach said. \"It's a fair question to [ask]: Has he ever played with a quarterback that likes to push the ball down the field?\n\"We have a lot of high hopes for him. I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\nThe trade to the Chiefs, at least initially, seemed to energize Toney. He said shortly after joining the Chiefs that he already felt more a part of things in Kansas City than he ever did with the Giants. Mullen said the switch in teams was a much-needed fresh start for Toney.\nBut eventually, he's going to have to produce.\n\"He's an outside-the-box player,\" Mullen said. \"But he's playing for an outside-the-box coach and with an outside-the-box quarterback and an outside-the-box organization that allows him to have some freedom and have some fun.\n\"He's got a unique set of skills. He's like Liam Neeson in \"Taken.\" He's got a special set of skills that make him very dangerous, but it's only if he's in the hands of the right person.\""}
{"title": "Michael Penix Jr. and the receiving corps behind the country's most high-power offense", "date": "2023-10-11 11:50:44", "text": "Joe Fortenbaugh explains why bettors should without a doubt take the over in Oregon vs. Washington. (0:44)\nSEATTLE -- When coach Kalen DeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb got to work at Washington in early December 2021, the facility was a bit of a ghost town. DeBoer planned to fill the bulk of his staff with several of his assistants from Fresno State, but five of them remained with the Bulldogs to see out their bowl game.\nOnly Grubb and cornerbacks coach/recruiting coordinator Julius Brown joined DeBoer immediately, leaving them to evaluate the roster to determine what to prioritize in recruiting and through the transfer portal. One thing that stood out to Grubb right away was how much talent there was at receiver. The production from Rome Odunze, Jalen McMillan and Ja'Lynn Polk wasn't eye-popping in 2021, but Grubb saw their potential.\nThere was just one problem.\n\"Rome, J-Mac and J.P. all were in the transfer portal or talking about transferring basically in the first week I was here,\" Grubb said. \"It's just me and Kalen. Nobody else is here yet [on the offensive staff]. So, my first 10 days, all I did was watch film with those three guys and try to convince them on the reasons to stay.\"\nThe pitch boiled down to this: DeBoer and Grubb had been successful everywhere they had been. Several receivers had put up big numbers in their offense and they had a vision for how to use all three to maximize their potential in different ways. Grubb showed them film of the offense from previous stops and how each player would fit in. Here's a concept from Eastern Michigan. This is what they did at Fresno State. And, of course, there was the season DeBoer spent as the OC at Indiana in 2019, when the Hoosiers -- the Indiana Hoosiers -- ranked third in the Big Ten in offense.\nGrubb's intent was to get the receivers excited about the offense and understand how they'd be used, but as he showed the cutups from Indiana, Odunze couldn't help but notice a certain left-handed quarterback.\n\"I was like, 'Oh my goodness,'\" Odunze said. \"He's placing the ball wherever he wants to every play.\"\nAt around the same time, quarterback Michael Penix Jr. finalized his own transfer decision. After four years at Indiana, each of which ended prematurely due to injury, it was time for a fresh start. For Washington, which was in the market for a veteran quarterback, the stars were aligning.\n\"I had a lot of people calling me, a lot of people [direct messaging] me and stuff like that about transferring,\" Penix said. \"But I never answered. Once I heard from DeBoer, I knew where I wanted to be.\"\nPenix's move to Washington couldn't have worked out much better. The receivers stayed and over the past two seasons, the Huskies have been among the most explosive offenses in college football. This year, Washington ranks No. 1 nationally in total offense (569.4 yards per game), No. 1 in passing yards (446.4 ypg) and No. 3 in scoring (46.0 points per game), turning Penix into ESPN.com's leading Heisman Trophy candidate in the process.\nPenix can take a major step toward the Heisman on Saturday, when the No. 7 Huskies (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) host No. 8 Oregon (5-0, 2-0) in a matchup of the nation's two top-ranked offenses.\nPENIX SHOWED SIGNS early he had a bright future in football.\nHis father played running back at Tennessee Tech and his uncle played at South Florida, so when he was old enough -- around 4 or 5 years old -- his parents signed him up. It was one of many sports he played to stay busy, growing up in Tampa, Florida.\nAs a freshman in high school, he earned his first scholarship offer -- from nearby Florida Atlantic -- preceding a standout career at Tampa Bay Tech, where he was the county player of the year.\nFor most of that time, Penix thought he was headed to the SEC. He committed to Tennessee under then-coach Butch Jones prior to his junior year in the spring of 2017 and spent the next two seasons preparing to go to Rocky Top. Then came the coaching change. Jones was out; Jeremy Pruitt was in.\n\"It was crazy. The new coach comes in and you're like, 'OK, I'm about to sign in a couple weeks,' and you don't hear anything from the coaching staff,\" Penix said. Eventually Penix learned, through his high school coach, that his offer had been pulled. Instead, Tennessee signed J.T. Shrout, who made eight appearances in four years at UT, played the 2022 season at Colorado and is now at Arkansas State.\nLeft without many options so late in the recruiting process, Penix ultimately decided between Indiana and Florida State, choosing the Hoosiers, in part, because former UT graduate assistant Nick Sheridan was the quarterbacks coach in Bloomington.\n\"It was certainly a rapid process,\" said Sheridan, who is now the tight ends coach at Washington. \"But it was nice because at least for me, I had known Mike and his family for a long time. I think he had braces when we first met. He was just a kid.\"\nA kid with star potential. Penix earned playing time as a true freshman, but his season ended in October, while playing in his third game, when he suffered a torn anterior crucial ligament in a close loss to Penn State.\n\"That was my first time ever getting injured in my life,\" Penix said. \"I never had a sprained ankle or anything, so when I got an ACL tear -- to be honest, going into college, I had never heard of an ACL tear. I didn't know what that was.\"\nThe rehab went about as well as it could have and Penix returned in time to compete for the starting job with two-year starter Peyton Ramsey in front of DeBoer, who arrived from Fresno State months earlier as the new offensive coordinator. In what was considered a surprise at the time, Penix beat out Ramsey.\n\"It wasn't what Peyton didn't do,\" then-Indiana coach Tom Allen said at the time. \"It was more of what I believe Mike can be.\"\nAnd in six starts that year, Penix showed flashes of what he could be, helping the Hoosiers to a 5-1 record in those games before a shoulder injury again ended his season prematurely. At the time, Penix's QBR (81.6) was comparable to Clemson's Trevor Lawrence (82.0), Oregon's Justin Herbert (77.5) and Iowa State's Brock Purdy (73.9), all of whom have since developed into franchise quarterbacks in the NFL.\nThe next two years followed a similarly frustrating script: He began the season as the starter only to see the season end in injuries (another torn ACL in 2020; a shoulder injury in 2021). By the time the 2021 season was winding down, Penix had graduated and knew it was time to move on.\n\"[The injuries were] my first time really seeing true adversity and I just had to understand that not everything's going to be perfect and I'm going to have to persevere through a lot of things throughout my career -- and I was able to,\" Penix said. \"It allowed me to get to where I'm at today, but it just gave me a different perspective of the game and just not take any play for granted.\"\nPENIX WAS UP front with Washington about his plan. He knew he had the talent to get a shot in the NFL, he just needed to prove he could stay healthy enough to earn that opportunity.\n\"He told us, 'Hey, it's my intention that I'm going to play one year and do really good and hopefully get drafted and move on,''' Grubb said. \"Because for Mike prior to [the 2022 season] he was like, 'If things go well. I don't want to risk getting hurt again.'\"\nThe staff understood his logic and was happy to welcome him under those circumstances.\nBut before that, he had to win the job and earn the trust of his teammates. There was widely-held assumption that he was the heavy favorite to win the job after arriving in December, but the dynamics of the quarterback competition were interesting considering the other two players were the two-year returning starter (Dylan Morris) and ESPN's former No. 1-ranked high school pocket passer (Sam Huard).\nFor Morris, what stood out immediately was how quickly Penix, who was already familiar with the new system having played for DeBoer, processed the game.\n\"From Day 1, I saw he was really talented throwing the ball, but it was the field vision,\" Morris said. \"That's the thing I've come to understand about him and I really try to learn from him -- his field vision is just on another level.\n\"I'm going through reads and am like, 'OK, I'm allowed to throw this or that,' but he's alerting something that's really not necessarily part of the progression. He just sees it and it's kind of funny you ask him, 'How'd you see that?' 'He's like, I don't know, I just saw it.' I'm like, 'Man, that's pretty elite.'\"\nPenix wasn't officially named the starter until about a week and a half before the Huskies' 2022 opener against Kent State, but by that time the writing was on the wall. Shortly after, he was voted a team captain in a nearly unanimous player vote.\n\"We all kind of rallied behind him,\" Odunze said. \"And I feel like that gave him more confidence as well. But he just stepped up his leadership to another level just understanding that, hey, he's going to be the leader of this offense and this team.\"\nAfter Washington went 4-8 the year before, the Huskies were a revelation in 2022. They reached the 11-win mark for the fifth time in school history, went 3-0 against ranked teams and capped the season with a win against Texas in the Valero Alamo Bowl to finish ranked No. 8 in the AP poll.\nPenix led the nation in passing, finished No. 8 in the Heisman voting and, perhaps most importantly, he stayed healthy for the entire season. Short of winning the Pac-12, the season followed the script he hoped it would. Then he rewrote the ending.\nInstead of opting out of the bowl game and declaring for the NFL draft -- a reasonable route considering recent trends and his own injury history -- Penix announced he was returning for another season.\n\"I just felt like we had unfinished business and there were more things that I wanted to accomplish and the more things I felt like this team could accomplish,\" Penix said. \"I knew I had the opportunity to be a part of it again, and I knew that just with another opportunity, we can do something great.\"\nTo some degree, Penix's understanding that he could make some money through name, image and likeness rules factored into the decision, but that was only part of it.\n\"This is one thing I love telling people, I think it's the epitome of Mike, which is very different from -- and not a lot of people would say this or report it or even admit it -- but Mike made his decision prior to having any NIL deals in place,\" Grubb said. \"I just think that's such a critical point of who Mike is that he wanted to be here and had enough trust in what was going to happen here. The reality was we knew something would happen [with NIL], but there were no contracts in place or 'this is what it's going to be' or anything like that.\"\nLast week, Penix and Odunze became the first college football players to sign NIL deals with Adidas and will participate in brand marketing campaigns, the company announced. Penix also has deals with Beats by Dre, trading card company Panini America and local apparel company Simply Seattle, along with other opportunities lined up by UW's NIL collective, Montlake Futures.\nPenix's decision to return had a domino effect with the team's other top players, with at least five others -- Bralen Trice, Zion Tupuola-Fetui, Tuli Letuligasenoa, Odunze and McMillan -- also making public announcements they would return to school.\n\"I was going over everything I could, calculating everything I could, talking with my family, with my dad, who is heavily involved in that as well,\" Odunze said of his decision. \"I was going over everything, but in the back of my mind was always, 'I'll be coming back with Penix.'\"\nGRUBB'S EARLY VISION for how to use Odunze, McMillan and Polk has largely played out as prophesized. They made a strong case for the best trio of receivers in college football last season with a combined 195 catches for 2,937 yards with 22 touchdowns, perhaps rivaled only by Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., Emeka Egbuka and Julian Fleming (185/2,947/30).\n\"They reset the bar completely here at Washington in terms of what it looks like to play receiver here,\" receivers coach JaMarcus Shephard said. \"And they're trying to hold each other, let alone the young guys in the room, accountable to not only upholding but uplifting that standard every single day at practice.\"\nThis year, they've taken it to a new level.\n\"I knew the offense, a lot of the plays and different coverages and different schemes. So I understood where I wanted my guys and where we had to get to in different areas of the field to be able to make those plays,\" Penix said. \"But now being in Year 2 now, everybody understands it. Everybody understands why Coach Grubb is changing the play or why he's calling a certain play and the look that we want. It just allows everybody to play much faster and more on the same page.\"\nIn Odunze, the Huskies have a prototypical No. 1 option. He's a threat to stretch the field, but equally adept in the screen game or on underneath routes. ESPN NFL draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. ranks Odunze as the No. 2 receiver in college football.\n\"I say this to everyone. Rome is a 10-year pro,\" Grubb said. \"I just don't mean he catches really well -- he could probably run for president, too. Responsible, tough, smart, personable. He's the guy.\"\nBut one of the keys to Washington's success is how well the receivers complement each other. McMillan controls the middle of the field from the slot. Polk might be the best route runner.\nThe group got deeper in the offseason with the arrival of one-time UW commit Germie Bernard, who spent his freshman season in 2022 at Michigan State. Bernard's 17 catches rank just behind McMillan (20) for fourth on the team, but had a breakout performance against Arizona on Sept. 30, when he led the team with eight catches for 98 yards.\nPenix is among the national leaders in every meaningful statistical category despite exiting early in four of the five games because the score was already out of hand. Washington would rank in the top half of the country in scoring just using its first half scoring average (30.2 ppg).\nFEW GAMES IN college football history have ever featured two offenses as explosive as Saturday's game between Oregon and Washington.\nCountering with their own Heisman candidate in quarterback Bo Nix, the Ducks rank No. 2 nationally in total offense (556.8 ppg), No. 1 in scoring margin (39.8 ppg) and No. 2 in scoring (51.6 ppg).\nThe teams' combined 97.6 ppg is the most between teams 5-0 or better since 2008, and the highest combined scoring average entering a Pac-12 game all-time, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\nIt also marks the final time the schools will play as members of the Pac-12, before moving to the Big Ten as a package deal next season.\nGiven what is set to be impacted -- College Football Playoff positioning, two Heisman campaigns, the final Pac-12 title race -- this might be the most anticipated Oregon-Washington game of all-time and a chance for Penix to further cement his legacy at Husky Stadium."}
{"title": "Mount could be left behind by England amid Man United woes", "date": "2023-10-11 12:10:23", "text": "Jarrod Bowen spoke about his place in the England side ahead of their friendly against Australia. (1:10)\nIt's time to talk about Mason Mount. Hardly anybody is right now, something which should alarm the midfielder especially as England manager Gareth Southgate prepares to utilise a rare opportunity to experiment in Friday's friendly against Australia at Wembley.\nThere was a solitary question about Mount's omission from this latest England squad in Southgate's news conference, occurring in the slipstream of wider conversations around Raheem Sterling's absence, Bukayo Saka's fitness and a deserved call-up for Jarrod Bowen.\nMount has not played for England since their World Cup quarterfinal defeat to France last December.\nPelvic and thigh injuries restricted his availability in March, June and September but he returned to the Manchester United team in good time for this latest international break only to be overlooked.\n\"Physically he's getting back up to a level,\" Southgate said. \"He's been an important player for us and we like him a lot. But I didn't think he'd done enough to be in ahead of the others at this moment in time.\"\nSouthgate has expended considerable credit on showing loyalty bordering on the excessive in retaining Harry Maguire amid his lack of playing time at United and Jordan Henderson after his controversial move to Saudi Arabia. Manchester City defender John Stones also made the cut despite not playing a single minute since the Community Shield on Aug. 6. (He did subsequently make his comeback from injury as a second-half substitute in Sunday's defeat at Arsenal.)\nStones remains arguably England's best centre-back, even though Pep Guardiola has been playing him in a deep-lying midfield role, but Henderson and Maguire are included for a combination of past achievements and their positive influence around the camp. It's a criteria that would have at one time automatically extended to Mount given his importance for club and country.\nBetween 2019 and 2022, Mount played 105 Premier League games for Chelsea. Only 13 outfield players in the division played more. His combined tally of 44 goals and assists was the 14th best figure in those three seasons.\nAcross all competitions, Mount played 59 games in 2019-20 and a staggering 69 in 2020-21, including five of England's seven matches on their way to the Euro 2020 final. In 2021-22, he made another 59 appearances before playing in four of England's five matches at the World Cup. It may be that this heavy workload in recent years has taken a physical toll in 2023, manifesting in persistent injury problems that hampered the end of his Chelsea career and complicated his start to life at Old Trafford.\nAlthough he often faced unfair social media criticism, managers have queued up to lavish praise on Mount to the extent it is no coincidence. Former Chelsea boss Frank Lampard could not speak highly enough of him. His successor, Thomas Tuchel, labelled Mount \"the full package\" and enjoyed working with him to the extent Bayern Munich explored a deal soon after Tuchel took over at the Allianz Arena. And United were sufficiently convinced to pay £60 million this summer for a player with one year left on his contract when many other Chelsea stars were departing for cut-priced fees driven by the Blues' urgent need to comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules.\nLampard often said Mount \"set the press\" for his team, a tireless work ethic Tuchel heartily embraced. United manager Erik ten Hag's desire to implement a high-pressing style made Mount a logical pursuit in one regard, even if many supporters believed the money could be better spent on other areas of the team.\nAnd Ten Hag appears to be still trying to find the right home for him. Is he a No. 8 or a No. 10? Can he play out wide? He is, perhaps, a victim of his own versatility. Against Brentford last weekend, Mount played as a No. 10 with Bruno Fernandes shunted out to the right. He went back out to the wing after half-time and ended with 37 touches in 63 minutes before being substituted.\nUnited are in a deep, collective malaise at present which almost inevitably affected Mount but given the short 18-month turnaround between the 2022 World Cup and next summer's Euro 2024 tournament, time is of the essence for the 24-year-old to establish himself. Because whereas Mount was once one of the first names on the team sheet at Chelsea and for England, the danger he now faces is that his country are threatening to evolve without him.\nSouthgate has been fixated on a 4-3-3 system for some time now and Mount's natural ability as a No. 8 would be an obvious fit. However, the emergence of Jude Bellingham could force a rethink. Bellingham's form for Real Madrid is bordering on the ludicrous: only the legendary forward Alfredo Di Stefano (11) scored more goals in his first 10 games than Bellingham's 10.\nEngland operated with something approximating a 4-2-3-1 shape last time out in a comfortable win over Scotland with Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips providing the midfield platform for Bellingham to go an influence the game to devastating effect.\nThere is an increasingly strong case for Southgate building this England team around Bellingham, especially as it would justify persevering with the Phillips-Rice axis which many view as overtly conservative but Southgate himself values as a useful option given the additional defensive cover they provide.\nAlthough England only reached the last eight in Qatar, Southgate has repeatedly stated how content he was with performances at the tournament, strongly suggesting there will be no radical overhaul in personnel.\nMount is a good traveller, a well-liked member of the squad and a credit to those in his support network. But as is the case with Sterling, who was a mainstay of the Southgate era, starting every tournament knockout game in his seven-year tenure prior to Qatar, Mount now finds his place on the plane in more doubt than at any time since his international debut in September 2019.\nSaka pulling out of the squad on Monday due to a hamstring strain created an opening but Southgate, perhaps ominously for Sterling, Mount and one or two others, chose not to call up a replacement.\n\"We try to make the best possible decisions for the right options, the right balance, the right personalities in the group but always the team,\" said Southgate. \"It is always about the team. It has to be about the team. Consistency allows that. You live experiences together and going to Poland and playing Ukraine in that environment.\n\"Going to Hampden [Scotland] and facing that environment like we did. There is a bond that is built for the whole group and that is what comes from continuity.\"\nMount used to be an essential part of that bond. He needs to prove he still is."}

The one-sided performance over the weekend boosted him into the latest divisional rankings.\nThat's the most significant change in these top 10s, although another Bellator 300 winner made a small move upward.

To celebrate, each week through the end of the season, Ryan McGee is presenting his favorite top-five things about the sport.\nThe five best-looking cars? Check. The five toughest drivers? We've got it. Top five mustaches? There can be only one, so maybe not.\nWithout further ado, our 75 favorite things about NASCAR, celebrating 75 years of stock car racing.\nPrevious installments: Toughest drivers | Greatest races | Best title fights | Best-looking cars | Worst-looking cars | Biggest cheaters | Biggest what-ifs | Weirdest racetracks | Best racetracks | Biggest scandals | Weirdest announcements\nSince we started our NASCAR 75th anniversary celebration of countdowns, our topics have run the gamut from toughness to greatness to weirdness.

One that combines toughness, greatness and weirdness, squeezes them together into a fist ... and then uses that fist to punch some fool in the mouth.\nSo, tape up those fingers, put in a mouthpiece, book Michael Buffer to shout his ready-to-rumble thing and rise from your corners of the ring as we present our five all-time greatest NASCAR fights.\nBuddy Baker was known as NASCAR's Gentle Giant, a nickname that was the most backhanded of compliments. At 6-foot-6 and 249 pounds, he was massive for a racer but a sweetheart of a man, and his disposition tagged with him with a \"fast but soft\" reputation. That only became worse when the son of three-time champ Buck Baker struggled to win races, with \"only\" three victories at the close of 1971, his 12th season in the Cup Series.\nTo change that reputation, Baker's friend and PR rep, legendary promoter Humpy Wheeler, decided Baker should take up boxing in the offseason. Wheeler, a Golden Gloves champion, started sparring with Baker in his garage. It worked, as Baker lost weight and felt his stamina increasing.\nThen, one day, Wheeler landed a little too sharp of a shot to Baker's face. The Gentle Giant went full Bruce Banner-turned-Hulk. The workout escalated into an all-out brawl that looked like Colin Firth and Hugh Grant in \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" as it spilled out of Wheeler's garage into the driveway and eventually into the yard of his next-door neighbor, who called the police to break it up.\n\"We ended up laughing about it,\" Wheeler recalled last year. \"Buddy also won a lot more races after that and ended up in the NASCAR Hall of Fame, so I take full credit for all of that because I punched him in the nose.\"\nFor as long as I have been covering NASCAR, I have developed something of a knack for finding myself ringside for some very sudden and very unexpected postrace garage brawls. The best was when I was interviewing Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Richmond, and in the middle of it, we both looked up at the giant screen just as Marcos Ambrose punched Casey Mears, and Dale Jr. said to me, \"What the hell? Those are the two nicest dudes ever!\"\nBut never have I been as stunned as I was when we were all posted up behind Brad Keselowski's hauler after the fall 2014 event at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Why BK? Because he had just ended the 500-mile event by clipping Denny Hamlin's car and also bumping Matt Kenseth's ride during the cool-down lap. When Hamlin barked at Keselowski in the garage, we totally expected that. What none of us saw coming -- especially Keselowski -- was notoriously mild-mannered Kenseth coming out of nowhere, sprinting past us all to bolt in between a couple of 18-wheelers, an alley where Brad had no escape, and tackle him like Fred Warner taking down a running back.\nIt was all caught on live TV, with Allen Bestwick speaking for the entire planet when he said, \"That's Matt Kenseth!\"\nThe only other time one driver essentially ran through me to go after another was following an Xfinity Series race at Bristol in 2002 when Kevin Harvick ran over me and others to go full WWE and leap off the top of a race car to land on Greg Biffle's head while \"The Biff\" was giving postrace interviews.\nThat was only a small fraction of the feuds that the former Trucks and Xfinity champ found himself caught up in during this century's first decade-plus, including a 2011 run-and-punch of Jay Sauter in the middle of a race at Richmond, grabbing hold of Jimmie Johnson at Martinsville in 2013 and, in the most infamous live interview of my career, a shoving match with Boris Said at Watkins Glen in 2011 in which Said, ahem, said to me, \"He's the most unprofessional little scaredy-cat I've ever seen in my life. He wouldn't even fight me like a man after. So, if someone texts me his address, I'll go see him Wednesday at his house and show him what he really needs. He needs a freaking whopping, and I'm going to give it to him.\"\nSpeaking of #NASCAR75 fights, pretty sure this is my most famous/infamous postrace interview. pic.twitter.com/yKLLqRcr06\nWe all like to think of Jeff Gordon as Mr. Mild-Mannered, the gentleman racer with the nice hair and the rainbow-colored car. If you really paid attention, though, you know he also raced with a fire akin to the flame stickers that covered that car later in his sport-altering career. See: his 2011 on-track fight with Jeff Burton that Texas Motor Speedway still uses in its promotional material, his 2006 \"helmet-on\" shove of Kenseth at Bristol and his 2014 pit road melee with Keselowski, also at Texas.\nBut nothing tops his dramatic duel with Clint Bowyer at Phoenix in 2012, when Gordon believed contact with Bowyer had ended his title hopes, so he returned the favor by hooking Bowyer later in the race. When he exited the No. 24 Chevy back in the garage, Bowyer's crew was waiting, but Gordon's crew was ready and a \"West Side Story\"-level fight broke out. Meanwhile, Bowyer ran the length of pit road and into the garage with ESPN cameras in tow, attempting to bolt into Gordon's hauler to reignite the fight.\nThe tension between the two drivers lingered for years, finally set aside when they ended up as broadcasting teammates at Fox Sports.\nAll due respect to those crews, the Battle Royale of team throwdowns will always be what took place in Charlotte Motor Speedway's Victory Lane following the 1989 NASCAR All-Star Race.\nWith the white flag in sight, Darrell Waltrip was leading by a few feet over Rusty Wallace, whose Pontiac slid up into the left rear corner of DW's Chevy and sent it spinning into the infield grass. As Wallace's team chased the car up the hill to the winner's circle, their path was blocked by Waltrip's crew. What followed was an endless series of shoves, punches, at least one biting of fingers and a crewman nearly losing both ears when his headset was ripped off.\nThe fight was eventually broken up by the police, but the impact of lasted for years. Waltrip decried that Wallace had \"let greed overcome speed\" and instantly went from bad guy to good guy in the eyes of a grandstand that had long booed him. For Wallace, it was the opposite.\n\"The next morning there were fans parked on the lake in their boats by my house just screaming at me,\" Wallace recalled. \"And when my kids woke up there were police cars in my driveway. I was like, 'Dad had a rough day. I'll explain it to you when you're older.'\"\nYou knew this had to be the No. 1 fight, right? It's the one where, even now all these decades later, you can still hear Ken Squier on CBS shouting, \"And there's a fight!\"\nThe short version of this story: Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison wrecked each other while running 1-2 on the final lap of the Great American Race, opening the door for Richard Petty to slip by and take the victory. When their cars came to rest in the rain-saturated infield grass between Turns 3 and 4, Yarborough and Allison got out and started shouting. That's when Bobby Allison, still mad about being knocked out of contention early in the race, pulled over to check on his brother ... and ended up fighting with Cale, too.\nAs Bobby likes to say, \"Cale questioned my ancestry and then he commenced to beating on my fist with his face.\" CBS cameras cut to the fight live as it happened, the blood-red cherry on top of the first ever flag-to-flag coverage of the Daytona 500, an audience of millions boosted by the fact that a snowstorm had most of the East Coast stuck indoors with nothing else to watch.\nDays later, NASCAR president Bill France Jr. called Yarborough and the Allisons onto the carpet at sanctioning body HQ and slapped them with massive fines ... that he never collected. \"Hell,\" Yarborough said years later, \"he should have paid us extra for what we did for the sport that day.\""}

The 2023-24 home and away jerseys utilise the Italian club's traditional colours, with the home resplendent in prim striping and gilded trim.\nA post shared by Venezia FC (@veneziafc)\nAway: The away shirt sees the Venezia colours reversed, with a pristine white bed adorned with nothing beyond a green-and-orange offset bar and another scattering of shimmering gold embellishments.\nA post shared by Venezia FC (@veneziafc)\nThird: The third kit is perhaps the most noteworthy as it is inspired directly by the famous striped uniforms worn by the gondoliers who navigate the canals of Venice.

In fact, all that's missing is the traditional straw boater hat.\nA post shared by Athens Kallithea FC (@athenskallitheafc)\nHome: Leaning heavily on the Venezia template, Kappa have created an equally fashionable set of kits for Greek second tier side Athens Kallithea. The home jersey is a navy design with an almost satin-like sheen, delicate pinstripes, button collar and elbow-length sleeves.\nA post shared by Athens Kallithea FC (@athenskallitheafc)\nAway: A lesson in minimalism, the away shirt has fine navy pinstripes adorning a fresh white bed which is all set off nicely by the burnished gold trim. Just to top the whole thing off, the club are also sponsored by the National Museum of Contemporary Art Athens (ΕΜΣΤ) -- it's not often a football club wears the name of a cultural institution so proudly.\nA post shared by PUMA France 🇫🇷 (@pumafrance)\nThird: Perfectly timed to coincide with the changing of the seasons, there is a distinct autumnal feel to Marseille's latest third kit.

(1:59)\nLAS VEGAS -- CHELSEA GRAY LOVES cooking with her family as much as playing basketball with her Las Vegas Aces.\n\"Our big family time was always in the kitchen,\" Gray said of growing up in California. \"My parents and my brothers, chopping up stuff, figuring out what we were going to make.\"\nShe jokes now that while her wife handles \"just about everything else,\" Gray is the primary cook in their home. Turkey meatballs are one of her specialties.\nThe same person who is so adept at putting together her favorite dishes also excels at orchestrating the Aces. Gray -- nicknamed \"Point Gawd\" around the league -- and the Aces look to take a commanding lead over the New York Liberty in the WNBA Finals in Game 2 on Wednesday (9 p.m. ET, ESPN/ESPN App) at Michelob Ultra Arena.\nIn Sunday's best-of-five series opener, a 99-82 Aces win, Gray had 20 points, nine assists and six rebounds as part of a perimeter attack the Liberty couldn't slow. In the regular season, she averaged 15.3 points and 7.3 assists; she's at 16.7 and 6.8 in the playoffs.\nGray was the missing ingredient for the Aces when she joined them as a free agent in 2021. The Aces had three former No. 1 draft picks in A'ja Wilson, Jackie Young and Kelsey Plum. Gray helped take them to another level.\nThe Aces played in the WNBA Finals in 2020 but were swept by the Seattle Storm. In 2021, the Aces lost in the semifinals to the Phoenix Mercury. Last year, with Gray having a phenomenal postseason, Las Vegas won the championship over the Connecticut Sun.\n\"That's why they call her the Point Gawd,\" Plum said. \"Because Gods deliver.\"\nChelsea Gray finds Jackie Young wide open on a backdoor pass to give the Aces a layup.\nLAST YEAR'S TITLE was a full circle moment for Gray, who was drafted by the Sun in 2014.\n\"I will never forget this: The Connecticut Sun gave me a chance,\" Gray said.\nGray was WNBA Finals MVP last season and hopes to lead the Aces to a repeat. She has two WNBA titles and an Olympic gold medal on her résumé, and after nine years in the league, has cemented her place as one of its best point guards.\nIncluding the playoffs, Chelsea Gray has scored or assisted on 1,472 of the Aces' 4,243 total points this season (34.6%), which ranks third in the WNBA in 2023. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nIt wasn't always this way. A fractured kneecap cut short Gray's college career at Duke in January 2014, a year after another season-ending knee injury ended her junior season.\n\"It was the lowest point,\" Gray said. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do. I kept going back to my mom and dad, and they said, 'Look, whatever else happens, you have your degree.' Man, it was hard.\"\nAt age 21, Gray had no idea if she could fulfill a childhood dream. She had grown up a fan of the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs and their point guard, Ticha Penicheiro.\nBut in the 2014 draft, Connecticut took Gray with the 11th pick, and she sat out that season rehabbing. She averaged 6.9 points and 2.7 assists as a reserve with the Sun in 2015.\nThen came the trade that changed her trajectory. Gray went to the Los Angeles Sparks in 2016 and helped them win a WNBA championship. The Sparks' veterans helped her mature as a professional.\n\"Being around players like Candace Parker and Alana Beard taught me so much,\" Gray said. \"Things like how to think ahead, knowing the scout, how to approach each game and how to prepare for the playoffs.\n\"I tried to absorb everything from them, on the court, at dinners. It opens your mind up to so many possibilities and strategies.\"\nGRAY'S PRECISION IS also complemented by her flair. As she puts it, \"there's a real enjoyment\" she plays with. Aces coach Becky Hammon said Gray sees the game at a higher level than anyone she has coached.\n\"She's one of the most competitive people I know,\" Hammon said. \"You feel really good when Chelsea is on your team. Big games, big moments, we know she gets on these out-of-the-world runs.\n\"And she's a studier. If we don't play well, she goes back and watches it and takes it personally. Her scoring and her passing are always going to be there.

Hammon was a point guard for 16 years in the WNBA, a player who depended on her wits, her scrappiness and her competitiveness to excel. Hammon said Gray has additional gifts, but all the things that made Hammon successful are also in Gray.\n\"You have to have great vision, but if you don't have the personnel to go with it, it won't work,\" Gray said. \"You'll see a lot of turnovers stack up. But I also think with maturity comes some freedom. I have [that] with a coach who trusts me. Like, she's seen how many times a behind-the-back pass is successful vs. not.\n\"I also watch a lot of film and know where people are going to be. If you do that, you can go to another level IQ-wise.\"\nGray is many years past the uncertainty she felt coming into the league. Yet those times haven't completely dimmed. In some ways, they still motivate Gray.\n\"Sometimes I hear that I play with grace,\" Gray said. \"I think that's a good word. Yes, there are many moments where it's very intense, or I might be yelling. But I think the joy I play with comes from those memories of when I really didn't know if I was going to continue playing because of my knee.\n\"Now, all these years later, I'm here. I've been a WNBA champion; I've been an Olympian. It's kind of crazy, the route I took. It wasn't instant gratification. But I think the way I play shows the journey.\""}
{"title": "Hazard was a showman who saw football as a game, not a job", "date": "2023-10-11 15:02:43", "text": "Former Chelsea and Real Madrid forward Eden Hazard has announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 32. (0:53)\nEden Hazard always said privately that the day he did not enjoy playing football anymore, he would quit. That day has now come.\nOn Tuesday, the 32-year-old decided to end his 16-year professional career because the game was not fun for him anymore. It hadn't been for a while ... probably since he joined Real Madrid from Chelsea for €100 million in 2019.\nHaving fun has always been the main reason why the winger played the game. Since he was a kid playing in the garden of the family home, all he wanted to do was enjoy himself. So it was no surprise that in his retirement message on social media he mentioned that he \"realised his dream to play and have fun on pitches all around the world.\"\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nDespite his recent injury issues at Madrid, Hazard leaves a legacy as one of the greatest forwards to have ever played in the Premier League. He is both a Chelsea legend and a Belgium legend. The stats speak for themselves: 110 goals in 352 games for his club, alongside two Premier League trophies, two Europa Leagues, one FA Cup and the personal accolades of PFA and FWA Player of the Year in 2014-15. For his country, we can add 33 goals in 126 games as a \"Golden Generation\" of star players reached their peak with a third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup.\nHazard was an artist; one of the best dribblers of his generation. In his prime, he was unplayable at times. With a low centre of gravity, skill on the ball, pace, intelligence and a burning desire to win, opponents often couldn't get near him, let alone get the ball off him -- as shown in the goal he scored when running from the halfway line against Arsenal in 2017.\nA football prodigy from a young age, Lille's scouts discovered him in 2005 and he made his pro debut for the club two years later when he was 16. In Ligue 1, he is still one of only two players to have been crowned Young Player of the Year and Player of the Year multiple times -- the other is Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappé.\nIn 2011, his talent propelled Lille to win the league and cup double. But he was way too good for Ligue 1. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in his final season before heading to Chelsea for around €40m in 2013. The move made sense as he joined a team where he would have a key role and where he would be the main man. And he was the main man -- winning trophies galore and terrorising Premier League defences up and down the country.\nBut Hazard only cared about matches and winning. Training was not for him; he didn't like it and didn't put much effort in. He was a big-time player who thrived on the big occasions, certainly domestically. It was his raison d'être.\nAlas, there were no big occasions when he moved to Real Madrid in 2019. Madrid was his dream and club legend Zinedine Zidane (who was then-manager) his childhood idol. But his four years in Spain were an absolute nightmare. There were injuries, misunderstandings, disappointments, poor decisions and failures, as well as the feeling that he threw in the towel too easily. One stat that bears out his injury issues more than any other is that he never played a single minute in El Clasico against rivals Barcelona. A big-time player -- until this year one of the top 10 most expensive of all-time -- never involved in the biggest game of all.\nThe beautiful game lives here.

He did that every summer at his previous teams, because for him the holidays were sacred, but the club never forgave him and he never really recovered. In Madrid, he stopped feeling like a footballer. Despite winning more trophies (LaLiga, twice; Copa del Rey; Spanish Super Cup; UEFA Super Cup; Club World Cup; and the Champions League), they never felt like his. That was the beginning of the end.\nSome may say that his four years at the Bernabeu ruined what he achieved at Stamford Bridge; some may say that his lack of good performances in the Champions League showed his limits. But comparisons to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are unfair -- they were machines, while he was more of a romantic who saw football as a game, not as a job.\nPerhaps that was part of the problem for his career, because he clearly never had the drive and ambition that Messi and Ronaldo had. Nevertheless, Hazard was the definitive \"flair\" player; a showman and entertainer. Fans would buy a match ticket just to watch him! At times, he made the impossible possible. As former Belgium assistant manager Thierry Henry once said: \"I would watch him and think: 'Why on earth is he trying this?' And then he would succeed, and I would be like: 'Ah yes, OK!'\"\nFootball needs those kinds of players and while Hazard has not been able to show his true skills for some time, he deserves his place among the greats for spreading fun and enjoyment of the game throughout his career."}

(1:15)\nWhen one rematch falls, another one rises.\nAlexander Volkanovski will step in for Charles Oliveira to face current lightweight champion Islam Makhachev for the 155-pound title at UFC 294 in Abu Dhabi. Oliveira, who first fought Makhachev and lost at UFC 280 last year, was severely cut above his eye during training and was forced to pull out of the main event rematch on Oct. 21.\nNow, on just 11 days notice, Volkanovski will get in on the rematch action and attempt to take down Makhachev and become a two-division champion. Volkanovski lost in a five-round thriller to Makhachev at UFC 284 in February 2023\nMarc Raimondi deep dives into the implications of the main event title change and hits on whether this puts Makhachev or Volkanovski in a more disadvantaged position going into their second bout.\nIt's surely a risk. I won't go as far as to say it's a mistake. Volkanovski is supremely confident and has already been there with Makhachev for five rounds. Had this been their first fight, one could imagine Volkanovski hesitating if this kind of opportunity arose. But now he knows what he's in for. He's felt Makhachev's strength, wrestling skill and power. I will say this, though: Volkanovski has a ton of guts for taking this fight without a training camp. If he loses at UFC 294, who knows if he gets another crack at the lightweight title?\nThis is an interesting question, because conventional wisdom says the fighter coming in on short notice with no training camp is at a disadvantage. But I've talked to plenty of coaches who say it could be the opposite - the banged-up fighter who's been training for six or eight weeks going against a \"fresh\" opponent they have not prepared for is the one at a deficit. Ultimately, though, it's not a mistake for Makhachev. He's the bigger man, has already beaten Volkanovski, and though he's been training for a different style of fight, he still has the wrestling and grappling to neutralize anyone.\nKhabib Nurmagomedov, who is back in camp working with Makhachev, believes a new opponent \"doesn't matter.\"\nAbout last news #ufc294 pic.twitter.com/xYu1uGYCZl\nHe heals up that cut and waits. Maybe he even gets a title shot next year in Brazil out of this. Who knows? Oliveira is still the No. 1 contender. He has to be concerned that Justin Gaethje, who knocked out Dustin Poirier to win the BMF title in July, is also right there. Oliveira still figures to be next in line, but what if Volkanovski wins and defends the featherweight title before the lightweight one? Could Oliveira have to fight and win again to get another chance at the belt? Anything is possible. The UFC is a fast-moving world.\nIt's as simple as Volkanovski represents the biggest possible fight - even bigger than Oliveira, theoretically - and he was available and willing. We at ESPN have Volkanovski ranked No. 1 pound-for-pound in the world. Makhachev is No. 2. As Dana White said Tuesday night, it's maybe the most anticipated rematch in division history. And that covers some ground. Lightweight is a premier division. The UFC did make overtures to others, including Mateusz Gamrot and Dustin Poirier, according to sources, but Volkanovski was the best possible option.\nAlexander Volkanovski forces the referee to stop the fight vs. Yair Rodriguez in Round 3 of the UFC 290 main event.\nIlia Topuria is the No. 1 contender. That much is clear. Who Topuria fights and when will be questioned if Volkanovski becomes the UFC lightweight champion. Volkanovski may come out of the Makhachev fight relatively early and want to move back down and defend the featherweight belt in his next fight. Volkanovski told me earlier this year that he's confident he could be a fighting champion in two divisions if it came to that.\nThe UFC could also pull the trigger on an interim title fight, like they did earlier this year when Volkanovski fought Makhachev for the first time. Topuria vs. Max Holloway for interim gold could be an interesting move. Before the last few days, Volkanovski vs. Topuria at UFC 297 in January was deep in negotiations and likely to happen, per sources.\nVolkanovski comes back down at some point and defends the title. The UFC could still end up doing an interim title fight. It'll all come down to timing.\nCould Volkanovski make a quick turn and defend the 145-pound belt early in 2024? Potentially, but it seems like it would be a lot to ask. An interim title fight, whether Volkanovski wins or loses, is probably a safe bet at this point."}

(1:00)\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson was placed on injured reserve Wednesday morning, meaning he'll miss at least the next four games with a right shoulder injury.\nRichardson sustained an AC joint sprain in Sunday's win over the Titans. The team has been doing extensive consultation with doctors to determine the length of Richardson's absence and now believes he will miss between four and eight weeks depending on his rehab and whether surgery is required, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Wednesday.\nIf Richardson misses only four games, he will be out for games at the Jaguars, home against the Browns and Saints, and a road game against the Panthers. After that four-game stretch, the Colts will play against the Patriots in Frankfurt, Germany, followed by a Week 11 bye.\nThe Colts are 3-2 and tied for the lead in the AFC South with Jacksonville heading into the Week 6 matchup with the Jaguars. Gardner Minshew, a former Jaguars draft pick, will start the rematch of a Week 1 game that Jacksonville won 31-21. Minshew entered in relief of Richardson against Tennessee and performed impressively, completing 11 of 14 attempts for 155 yards in two-plus quarters of action. Minshew has already seen considerable action this season because of earlier medical issues with Richardson. The veteran backup has completed 68.7% of his 83 pass attempts for 553 yards and has not thrown an interception.\nSunday's injury was the third time Richardson has had an injury scenario this season. The 2023 fourth overall pick has now departed three separate games prematurely. Richardson was pulled during the final moments of the season opener against Jacksonville after taking a hit to his knee, then missed Indianapolis' Week 3 contest against the Ravens after suffering a concussion against the Texans in the previous game.\n\"It gets tough when a guy gets dinged up, and he's been dinged up,\" coach Shane Steichen said earlier this week. \"He's obviously a very, very talented player and it's tough. But we have a lot of faith in Gardner to step in and go operate the way he's been doing.\"\nOf Minshew, who spent time with Steichen during his previous stint as the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator, the Colts coach said, \"I think he's an elite processor of the game. You've got a guy that can process the game quickly and make quick decisions. He's really good, he's accurate, he knows where to go with the football at the right time and the right place and he's been awesome for us.\"\nQuarterback Sam Ehlinger will be Minshew's backup. The Colts also signed former Vikings draft pick Kellen Mond to the practice squad on Wednesday."}

But the Bulldogs stomped the Wildcats, leading 34-7 by halftime and outgaining their SEC East opponent 608-183.\nGeorgia has won 14 straight games against Kentucky, last losing to the Wildcats in November 2009.\nAfter the game, Stoops looked to shoulder the blame and said Georgia \"beat us in every area.\"\n\"It doesn't feel good,\" he said Saturday. \"I told the team that the good news is that it counts as one game.

{"title": "Ranking top rookies through five weeks: How many QBs make our top 10?", "date": "2023-10-11 15:18:55", "text": "C.J. Stroud joins Pat McAfee to discuss how he plans to prove his pre-draft doubters wrong with the Texans. (1:42)\nThe 2023 NFL draft class has started strong through the first five weeks of the regular season. Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua, a fifth-round pick, flourished on the field when Cooper Kupp was injured to start the season, and Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud has looked poised under center. Plus, the 5-0 Philadelphia Eagles' defense is surely benefiting from defensive tackle Jalen Carter's great play to start out his career.\nHow do the rookies stack up? We polled five NFL analysts -- Matt Bowen, Jeff Legwold, Matt Miller, Brooke Pryor and Jordan Reid -- to make a consensus ranking of the top 10 rookies and let each weigh in on those players, along with three who just missed the final list. They also pointed out the biggest rookie class takeaway, provided an outlook on first-round quarterback situations, picked an overperforming late-rounder and underperforming first-rounder, and named the rookie who has the best single-game performance so far. Let's start our top 10 ranking with a record-breaking first-round quarterback.\nJump to:\nTop 10 | Just missed\nBig questions\nStats: 1,461 passing yards, 7 TD passes, 0 INTs\nDrafted: No. 2 overall\nWhy is Stroud No. 1? Let's start with the fact that the first 186 regular-season passing attempts of his career went without an interception -- and that's now an NFL record. Even in the face of the pressure, he has played with composure and quality decision-making.\nStroud has been busy, too. He has the fifth-most attempts in the league, is one of seven quarterbacks with at least 200 total dropbacks and has a QBR (56.2) better than Trevor Lawrence, Derek Carr and Deshaun Watson. Stroud is finding success on a Texans team swimming with young players. -- Legwold\nStats: 12 tackles, 3.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles\nDrafted: No. 9 overall\nCarter has certainly made a case to be the NFL's top rookie with his disruptive traits on the Eagles' defensive front. He has 12 pressures, and his pass rush win rate of 23.5% ranks 13th in the league. If you watch his tape, you can see his interior matchup ability, power and initial first-step quickness.\nCarter has game-wrecking talent at a premium position, and if he continues playing like this, he'll be in the mix for Defensive Rookie of the Year. -- Bowen\nStats: 46 catches, 572 yards, 2 TDs\nDrafted: No. 177 overall\nThis fifth-round pick leads the NFL in receptions and is second in receiving yards behind only Tyreek Hill. He has 10 catches of at least 20 yards, tied for fourth most. Rams QB Matthew Stafford was without top receiver Cooper Kupp for the first four weeks of the season, but it didn't matter, because Nacua exploded in Sean McVay's pass-happy offense. Nacua had at least 100 receiving yards in three of the Rams' five games.\nWith Kupp back, Nacua's weekly output might look more like his 71-yard, one-touchdown performance from Week 5, but he has established himself as a reliable target and is on the radar for Offensive Rookie of the Year. -- Pryor\nStats: 38 carries, 460 rushing yards, 5 rushing TDs, 9 catches, 67 receiving yards, 2 receiving TDs\nDrafted: No. 84 overall\nAchane, a third-round pick, quickly turned into one of the most dynamic running backs in the league. His 460 rushing yards ranks second to only the 49ers' Christian McCaffrey, and Achane is averaging 12.1 yards per carry, which leads the NFL by nearly 5 yards. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, his per-carry average is the most for any player through a team's first five games in league history (min. 25 rushes).\nAfter the great start, he is now expected to miss multiple weeks with a knee injury and is a candidate for injured reserve. -- Reid\nWith De'Von Achane expected to miss mutliple weeks, Daniel Dopp strongly recommends grabbing Jeff Wilson Jr. in fantasy\nStats: 23 tackles, 2 sacks, 1 INT, 1 defensive TD\nDrafted: No. 5 overall\nA hamstring injury suffered in training camp meant a slow start to the season for Witherspoon, but in three games, he has shown why he was the top defensive back drafted in April. Witherspoon has one interception -- which he returned 97 yards for a touchdown -- four pass breakups and a pair of sacks. Given his instincts and the fact that opposing offenses have to choose between challenging him or Riq Woolen, it stands to reason he'll have plenty of opportunities to add more interceptions this season.\nSeattle seems determined to put Witherspoon in a position to make plays in the passing game and as a blitzer, so expect legitimate DROY numbers from him. -- Miller\nStats: 25 tackles, 1 INT, 1 defensive TD\nDrafted: No. 45 overall\nBranch missed the Lions' Week 5 game against the Panthers with a right ankle injury and is a question mark for this week's game against the Buccaneers. But through four games, he was tied for the team lead in tackles (25) and tackles for loss (three), and he had returned an interception off QB Patrick Mahomes for a touchdown against the Chiefs in the season opener. Not bad.\nBranch plays with physicality in the run game, has veteran-like awareness and is decisive in coverage -- all must-haves for a slot corner in the league. -- Legwold\n• Early mock drafts: Miller » | Reid »\n• Ranks: Kiper » | Positional top fives »\n• QB Hot Board » | Early predictions »\n• Projected draft order » | Read more »\nStats: 17 tackles, 1 sack, 1 INT\nDrafted: No. 17 overall\nGonzalez suffered a right shoulder injury in Week 4 that put him on the injured reserve list, but he makes the cut here due to his performance in those first four games and, most notably, his coverage ability. Gonzalez recorded one interception, one sack, three pass breakups and 14 solo tackles over Weeks 1-4.\nHe is sticky in coverage, fluid in transition and had great speed to defend routes at all three levels of the field. Plus, Gonzalez has shown backfield vision to operate as a zone defender from off-the-ball alignments. The loss of Gonzalez was evident in the Patriots' 34-0 loss to the Saints on Sunday. -- Bowen\nStats: 25 catches, 289 yards, 3 TDs\nDrafted: No. 34 overall\nThis sentence works better read in a deadpan Meryl Streep \"The Devil Wears Prada\" voice: An Iowa tight end blowing up in the NFL? Groundbreaking. Jokes aside, what LaPorta is doing through five games is pretty darn close to groundbreaking. Against the Panthers this past weekend, LaPorta scored two touchdowns, including a 31-yarder off an end-around flea-flicker, making him the first tight end in franchise history to have multiple 30-yard catches in a season. He leads all tight ends with 289 receiving yards and is averaging 11.6 yards per reception.\nHis emergence is also a big boost to the Lions' offense, opening things up in the running game for David Montgomery and fellow rookie Jahmyr Gibbs. Things are only looking up for the 4-1 Lions and LaPorta. -- Pryor\nStats: 67 carries, 364 rushing yards, 0 rushing TDs, 21 catches, 146 receiving yards, 2 receiving TDs\nDrafted: No. 8 overall\nRobinson was one of the favorites for Offensive Rookie of the Year coming into the season and has shown flashes of why Atlanta was so comfortable with selecting him in the top 10. Despite only having one game with at least 15 carries, he remains a featured option in multiple phases in Arthur Smith's offense, as he's tied for eighth in the league in rushing yards.\nRobinson's tackle-breaking ability was among his best traits at Texas and has translated seamlessly to the NFL. But some of his best plays have come as a pass-catcher. Although he has not reached the end zone as a rusher, he has two receiving touchdowns. -- Reid\nLiz Loza acknowledges that fantasy managers were sweating Bijan Robinson's early numbers but still got production as he scored a touchdown late.\nStats: 21 tackles, 1 sack\nDrafted: No. 3 overall\nAnderson has been slightly overshadowed by Stroud in Houston but is still fantastic in his own right. The edge rusher has just one sack in five games, but he has added 21 tackles and a blocked field goal to go with it. Anderson's pass rush win rate of 30.1% is third best in the league and shows he's getting to the quarterback. And as the season goes on, he'll start to close on the passer better to turn those pressures into sacks.\nHis flashes through five games have been notable, and my bet would be that Anderson will end the season with double-digit sacks. -- Miller\nKeeanu Benton, DT, Pittsburgh Steelers: The second-rounder (No. 49 overall) has played 38% of the Steelers' defensive snaps. Benton has already shown a quality run stop win rate of 34.4%, which is in the same statistical neighborhood as the Saints' Cameron Jordan (34.3%) and the Jets' Quinnen Williams (34.6%). -- Legwold\nPick NFL games every week and compete for prizes! FREE to play.\nMake Your Picks\nZay Flowers, WR, Baltimore Ravens: With the injuries in the Ravens' offense, the No. 22 overall pick had to quickly become a consistent option for QB Lamar Jackson. Flowers leads the Ravens in catches (29) and receiving yards (317). He's still on the hunt for his first touchdown catch, and he has sprinkled in two drops, but it's clear that Jackson trusts him. -- Legwold\nAnthony Richardson, QB, Indianapolis Colts: Richardson landed on injured reserve and will miss some time due to a right shoulder injury suffered in Week 5 against the Titans. But the first-rounder has shown promise with seven total touchdowns (three passing, four rushing) and has displayed why he has an immense ceiling. -- Legwold\nHouston's aggressiveness to land Stroud and Anderson with back-to-back picks is paying off with the best early returns of the 2023 draft class. Not only does Stroud look like the top rookie quarterback, but Anderson is a leader on the Texans' defense and is playing well. Plus, receiver Tank Dell (third-round pick) is averaging 17.1 yards per reception, and linebacker Henry To'oTo'o (fifth-round pick) looks great. This 2-3 Texans team is ascending in the AFC thanks in part to their rookies' play. -- Pryor\nRichardson (No. 4 pick) missed one game with a concussion, and he's now down for at least four games with a shoulder injury. We've seen his playmaking traits, both as a runner and thrower, but he will need to log more reps against pressure when he returns and improve there. Richardson's QBR of 34.4 when blitzed ranks 29th in the NFL.\nCarolina's Bryce Young (No. 1 pick) must improve his decision-making and ball security while also generating more explosive plays. He has two games with multiple interceptions in four starts, and his four explosive-play throws rank 34th in the league. -- Bowen\nChuck Pagano, Pat McAfee and A.J. Hawk discuss Bryce Young's struggles early in his NFL career.\nTexans linebacker Henry To'oTo'o. Drafted at No. 167 overall, he has stepped right into the middle of DeMeco Ryans' defense, and his instincts against the run and instincts in coverage have continued to stand out each week. He leads all first-year linebackers with 39 tackles and has been among the biggest bright spots of an impressive rookie class. To'oTo'o is known for his football sense and see-read-react ability on the second level, and we're seeing it. -- Reid\nRaiders defensive end Tyree Wilson. The pass-rusher was drafted to take pressure off Maxx Crosby, and that need has only heightened since the Raiders released Chandler Jones. Wilson has zero sacks and a 4.3% pass rush win rate through four games. He needs to get on the field more and start making an impact that lives up to the No. 7 overall pick that the Raiders used on him. -- Miller\nThe rookie class has already had many top performances this season. Stroud's 306-yard, two-touchdown day in the Texans' rout over the Steelers is on the shortlist. So is Carter's two-sack, four-tackle game against the Rams in Week 5. However, it's hard to beat Nakua's Week 4 performance when he turned 10 targets into nine catches for 163 yards and a touchdown in the Rams overtime win over the Colts. -- Legwold "}

The stadium DJ clearly has a sense of humour, unless the playlist is part of some cunning plan to strike fear into the hearts and minds of Slovenia's players.\nSan Marino sits 207th out of 207 in the FIFA men's rankings -- they climbed up from 208th spot in September because Eritrea, previously above them, was removed from the list after four years without a game -- and they have been rooted to rock-bottom since November 2018. The only fear being felt by Slovenia is probably about suffering the ignominy of being one of a few teams that hasn't beaten San Marino.\nApril 2024 will mark the 20th anniversary of their last -- and only -- victory, when Andy Selva's sixth-minute goal sealed a 1-0 home win in a friendly against Liechtenstein in front of just 200 supporters. While it is a harsh label to apply to a team from a tiny country of 33,000 inhabitants, it is an inescapable fact that San Marino are the worst football team in the world.\nIf you have 11 minutes and 48 seconds to spare, you can watch every goal San Marino have ever scored since their first game in 1990, with all 28 of them neatly packaged together in one YouTube video. Alas, on this September night there is no win, and no more goals, for La Serenissima as Slovenia run out 4-0 winners in front of 844 spectators to extend San Marino's winless run to 132 games.\nThe only excitement comes off the pitch, when supporters watching the game for free in the woodland behind the goal inadvertently set fire to bushes with pyrotechnic flares, causing the final 20 minutes to be played out with thick smoke drifting across the field.\nIf it is a \"Highway to Hell,\" San Marino seem to be stuck on a never-ending journey, desperately searching for a way to find that elusive victory to end their nightmare run of failure.\nBut is it really even failure?\nSan Marino, a landlocked, mountainous microstate, is the world's fifth-smallest country. It has no airport, not even a train station, and its football team is a collection of part-time players who get to face some of the game's biggest stars while holding down day jobs: the recent squad included a mechanic, delivery driver and a worker in a jewellery factory. San Marino's coach, Fabrizio Costantini, works in a furniture warehouse.\nWhen they fly to Belfast to face Northern Ireland in another qualifier this Saturday, Costantini and his players will be forced to take Friday off work so they can travel. All this losing hurts, but there is also a deep sense of pride within the squad that they're able to represent their country. These are just normal guys living a dream.\n\"It's not the same for us because we are not professionals,\" San Marino captain Matteo Vitaioli, a graphic designer, tells ESPN. \"I have to work, my teammates have to work, but that's normal for us. The most important thing is to have the heart and passion to succeed and fill the gap.\n\"It's difficult, but of course we are proud, even if we are at the bottom of the FIFA ranking. We are here: we are one of the smallest countries in the world, but we play with 100 percent and it is just us, no other nationalities. Even Italy uses players from other countries, but we are just San Marino, so we are very proud of that.\"\nAs the Slovenia team bus pulls away and heads for nearby Rimini, Italy, where they'll fly back to Ljubljana, San Marino's players head to their cars. It's almost midnight on Sunday; many of them are expected at work the following morning.\nTRISTAN CESELKOVSKI IS 16 YEARS OLD and is sitting on a bench on Via della Fratta with his father, Boris. Tristan is wearing a full San Marino kit. It's matchday in San Marino, but Tristan is the only person wearing the team's colours, making him stand out immediately among the tourists who have come to take in the stunning views of the Adriatic coast from the top of Monte Titano or visit the 14th century Church of San Francesco.\nBut Tristan is no ordinary supporter. He and his father have just arrived in San Marino after a 540-mile drive from their home in Vienna. The journey took 8½ hours, and they will be heading back after the game. \"He's my son and he loves San Marino, so it's what you have to do,\" Boris tells ESPN with a laugh and shrug of the shoulders.\n\"San Marino are my favourite team,\" Tristan says. \"I know they don't win, but it's the way the players never give up. They always play with passion and I have always wanted to watch them play.\"\nThe San Marino team is a strange phenomenon. Walking around San Marino in search of supporters is no easy task because, for locals at least, there is simply no sense of connection to the players who represent their tiny country. \"You won't find any San Marino fans here,\" a waiter named Matteo at Birrificio Abusivo, the bar that sells the only beer brewed in the micronation, tells ESPN. \"You only know that San Marino are playing because the fans of the other team come into town to drink.\"\nSan Marino -- or the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, to use its full name -- is serene as in \"sovereign\" rather than \"calm and stable,\" although it is both of those things, too.\nIt was once one of many similar city-states on the Italian peninsula, dating back to its founding in 301 A.D. But while bigger city-states, including Venice and Genoa, were all part of the unification of Italy in 1861, San Marino retained its independence and sovereignty because, as legend has it, the country offered refuge to unification movement leader Giuseppe Garibaldi and his troops during conflict with the Austrian Empire and Papal States. When Garibaldi succeeded in unifying Italy, San Marino was granted its wish of independence in an 1862 treaty and has kept it ever since, even to the extent of remaining neutral during World War II.\nIt also managed to retain its own currency, the Sammarinese lira, until it was replaced by the euro in 2002, and Italian is the only language spoken, which is useful considering San Marino is surrounded by Italy on all sides and neighbours Rimini, the five-star resort on the Adriatic Coast. It's also small, covering just 24 square miles, and has the same population as Helena, the capital of Montana.\nImagine Helena having its own team, playing games against the U.S. or Mexico, and you get the picture.\nDan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\nFinding a San Marino shirt among the shops selling clothes, fragrances and guns -- there are lots of places to purchase firearms in San Marino -- is also a challenge. It turns out just two shops stock the pale blue home shirt. \"We don't sell many,\" a shopkeeper at one, Roberto, tells ESPN. \"It's usually visiting supporters who ask, but I did sell one this morning to the Ukrainian match officials. They came in looking for it specifically.\"\nAt the other sportswear shop, they even sell San Marino's dark blue away kit. This weekend, the store was busier selling Ducati and Yamaha merchandise to the bikers in town for the San Marino MotoGP, but the owner, Michele, says business is good when big teams play San Marino.\n\"I sell lots of shirts to English, Spanish and German fans,\" she tells ESPN. \"The San Marino shirt is a novelty. Nobody from San Marino buys them, but it seems as though foreign visitors like it because the team is not so good.\"\nThere is a souvenir stand at the stadium although there is an element of farce as Martina and Francesco, who work for the San Marino Football Federation, attempt to sell shirts, scarves and pendants to supporters. Their wooden cabin is positioned in a dark corner away from the stadium, facing away from the coach park used by Slovenia fans. There is no electricity in the cabin; everything is in darkness until Francesco uses the spotlight on his phone to highlight the merchandise.\n\"I'm usually the team liaison officer,\" Martina tells ESPN. \"But I help out with the shop at games. It's not so busy tonight, but we had long queues when England played here.\"\nSan Marino do have a small and loyal fanbase, but the emphasis is on the word \"small.\" Inside the stadium, Tristan and Boris have met up with a tiny group of San Marino's most ardent supporters: Josef Junker, Nicolo Vallone and Daniele Dei.\nDaniele is from Modena, 150 miles away. He watches every home game and does one away trip each year, while Josef has travelled from his home in Bavaria to watch every home game for the past 10 years. \"My first game was 20 years ago,\" Josef tells ESPN. \"I am German, but I am not a fan of the Germany team. They are too arrogant. I come to watch San Marino because of the honesty and the amateur element of it. It's real football.\n\"Why do I come? To see San Marino draw and score: those moments are special. And hopefully, someday soon, a win.\" It perhaps sums up the nation's hard-luck story that super-fan Josef was not among the 200 who saw them beat Liechtenstein in 2004.\nSAN MARINO PLAYED THEIR LAST HOME GAME, against Kazakhstan in June, 200 miles away in Parma, Italy, to upgrade the playing surface at San Marino Stadium so it met UEFA standards.\n\"It's too good now,\" one of the San Marino officials tells ESPN. \"It makes it even harder for the players to compete against the top teams.\" The suited official then points to an overgrown field next to the stadium car park and jokes, \"We prefer it to be like that.\"\nThe problem for San Marino is that it is not only the top teams against whom they struggle. Since the start of last year, they have also lost to Cape Verde, Malta (twice) and St. Lucia. Yet despite the recurring nightmare of playing and losing (sometimes heavily), there is an absence of cynicism or weariness among the players when asked whether they grow tired of experiencing defeat virtually every game.\nPerhaps it is down to their everyday reality of their lives: they're working men who get to live the dream of playing football against some of the world's best players before going back to reality the following day. There are no hard-bitten, professional egos among them. They are simply enthusiastic amateurs who want to do their best, no matter the opposition.\nDefender Roberto di Maio, who at the age of 40 in March became the oldest footballer in Europe to make his international debut, admits every game is a test of physical and mental capabilities. \"Of course, it's complicated because we're facing such skillful nations,\" Di Maio, who works for the federation, tells ESPN. \"We are 90 minutes-plus under pressure every time, so it's difficult. We have to stay focused all the time.\n\"Sometimes it's good when we're facing not-so-good teams. Others, like for example Denmark, whom we faced in September, they're very tough to play. You have to stay focused all the time. No mistakes.\"\nAs San Marino's goalkeeper, Elia Benedettini, who works for his parents' transport company, has one of the toughest jobs in sport. He concedes goals in most games -- he has managed two shutouts, against the Seychelles and Gibraltar, in 45 games -- and it took Slovenia just four minutes to open the scoring in this match. But the 28-year-old, who has played as high as Serie B in Italy, does not regard his role as a thankless task.\n\"I know it's difficult,\" he says. \"But it's always a good feeling to play in a San Marino shirt, no matter the results. It's a dream to play in these matches, even though it's tough. I think it is a beautiful experience and all of our opponents, even the big stars, treat us with respect.\"\nPlaying against San Marino is not easy either, despite the reality that it usually results in three points for the opposition. Germany inflicted San Marino's heaviest defeat with a 13-0 win in September 2006, while England recorded a 10-0 victory in November 2021. Yet San Marino famously scored the then-fastest-ever international goal when Davide Gualtieri put the team ahead after just seven seconds against England in November 1993. That game still ended in a 7-1 defeat.\nFormer Manchester City and England defender Joleon Lescott, who played in an 8-0 win in San Marino in March 2013, told ESPN that games against them come with unique challenges.\n\"When you play against San Marino, you just have to get to 2-0 as quickly as possible,\" he says. \"The last thing you want is to be in a situation where they could score and make things difficult for you. If you concede against them, or fail to win, it's a historical moment and the kind of history that you will never be allowed to forget. You have to treat the game with absolute focus and just score as early as you can.\"\nWhen told of Lescott's admission that even England players worry about facing San Marino, defender Simone Franciosi, a student by day, smiles. \"If great players from England are maybe, I would say, a little bit stressed about facing San Marino, it's good news,\" he says. \"It's great news. Thank you!\n\"Our objective is always the same: keep it 0-0 for as long as possible to feed the pressure, but sure, it's not easy. We don't play to lose; we always want to win, but I have just started my international career and I know it will be tough to win these games.\"\nRegardless of the likely outcome of every game they play, none of the San Marino players suggests that representing their country is a burden and Di Maio is perhaps the best example of the joy that it brings. Born in Naples, he is the only non-Sammarinese in Costantini's squad, having waited 13 years for his San Marino nationality. He's now making up for lost time.\n\"There are some special laws in San Marino,\" he says. \"I waited 13 years and married a San Marino girl, so I have my nationality now. It's a very long time, but I succeeded.\n\"As long as I have fun, I want to play again. Again, again. If the mind is good, the body will follow the mind, so of course I can go on. It's fun for me, even to have four goals to zero. But the most important thing for us is to compete and we do that.\n\"There are so many players here who, tomorrow, will go to work, but they have a job and we have to applaud these guys because they are perfect.\"\nBattistini's colleagues -- he's a mechanic by trade -- also acknowledged that sense of awe at being able to keep up. \"He's never here at work, always playing, but we need him here too because he is so good!\"\nVitaioli wears the captain's armband against Slovenia and is back in his studio as a designer by 9 o'clock the following morning. That's the reality for this group of players. \"It's normal for us,\" he says. \"We all play for semi-professional clubs in San Marino, some of us in Italy, but when we work, we're just normal guys in the office or the factory.\"\nHis workmates are still impressed -- \"He knows how to do everything -- both to play soccer and being a great designer\" -- but Vitaioli has a more grounded perspective.\n\"Nobody sees us as stars,\" he says with a smile.\nSAN MARINO ARE READY TO WIN. Twenty years without a victory is an unwanted milestone that is fast approaching, but the team is improving -- Costantini's side has conceded just 21 goals in six Euro 2024 qualifiers -- and they can see light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. When the UEFA Nations League resumes in 2024, San Marino will be in League D alongside fellow minnows Andorra, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, the only team they've ever beaten.\nThe losses in their Euro 2024 group have been expected, but by making themselves more organised defensively, there is a genuine hope that the tactical work will pay off when playing against teams of a similar standard.\n\"The Nations League is a big chance for us,\" San Marino Football Federation president Marco Tura tells ESPN. \"That's the opportunity for us to draw or even win. This is our competition, so it's like tailor-made for us. We want to practice good and perform good and if the feeling is good for the players on the pitch, maybe it would be a dream for us to succeed, to draw or win, which is our goal.\"\nCostantini, who has been in charge since November 2021, agrees that the Nations League offers San Marino their best chance to win for 20 years.\n\"We should focus on preparing for the best of our opportunities with the Nations League next year,\" he says. \"Because in that tournament we will have the opportunity to share the pitch with the teams that aren't better than us in terms of physical approach, athletic skills and technical ones. They are closer to our level and we will have the opportunity to get the result.\"\nSelva remains the only player to have scored a winning goal for San Marino. He is the country's all-time top scorer with eight international goals during an 18-year career and speaking to The Times (UK) in 2021, he recalled the feeling of beating Liechtenstein in 2004.\n\"The emotion was indescribable,\" Selva says. \"We felt something different on the pitch during that game. We were very focused, there was an electricity in the air. We felt that sooner or later the result would come, and that maybe that was the right time. For a team used to always losing, getting a win, even in a friendly, is something so beautiful. Those moments will remain in history for every player.\"\nLorenzo Lazzari, San Marino's centre-forward and a full-time student, dreams of emulating Selva and scoring his country's first winning goal for two decades. The 20-year-old was born two months after that solitary victory, but he already holds the distinction of being the last player to score for San Marino, seven games ago, in a 1-1 draw against St. Lucia in November 2022.\nLazzari made his San Marino debut as a second-half substitute in that game and he became an instant hero by equalising in the fourth minute of stoppage time. \"It was a big emotion for me,\" Lazzari tells ESPN. \"It was even unbelievable. I didn't expect it, so it was special for me.\n\"Of course it's difficult to play as a striker for San Marino, but it's a dream to score and it'll be a dream even bigger than the one in St. Lucia if I can score a winning goal.\"\nAS THE SAN MARINO PLAYERS WALK OFF THE PITCH at the end of their latest defeat, this time against Slovenia, the bond between themselves and their small band of supporters is evident. Members of the team seek out young fans in the crowd to whom they can pass on their kit -- even down to the shorts and socks. The players are determined to win; the fans are equally desperate to witness it.\n\"It's amazing for us to have supporters all around the world,\" goalkeeper Benedettini says. \"Even on social media, we get some messages from Argentina, Brazil, which is, for us, something crazy.\n\"But there are the fans who are here too. There are not so many, but we appreciate them and for those guys that are supporting us all the time, maybe next year we will do something special and dedicate it to them.\"\nSooner or later, San Marino will be ready to celebrate. They might even get the locals along to the party, too."}

Brooks struck Theis in the groin with his left hand and was whistled for the flagrant 2 foul by referee Mitch Ervin.\n\"For a flagrant 2 foul like that, you got to know if a person is doing it on purpose or intention,\" Brooks said. \"That's really going at who I am as a person. That ref, Mitch, that just shows that he just doesn't know who I am as a person. He's just going off what's been said.\"\nThe Grizzlies opted against attempting to re-sign Brooks in free agency this summer because of his often-antagonistic antics, among other factors. He subsequently agreed to a four-year, $80 million contract with the Rockets.\nRockets coach Ime Udoka acknowledged there is a perception around Brooks.\n\"We love his aggressiveness and physicality,\" Udoka said, according to the Houston Chronicle. \"But reputations carry in the NBA, and people will look for certain things.

{"title": "The NFL's field fight has just begun: Players want grass, the league says it’s not that easy", "date": "2023-10-11 15:30:15", "text": "Andrew Hawkins says it's only a matter of time before the NFL will switch from turf field to grass. (0:38)\nFor years, the grass field at Nissan Stadium in Nashville was a mess. It was loose in some areas and barren in others, and it got increasingly slippery during the Tennessee Titans' regular season. Worse, according to data collected by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, there was a higher rate of noncontact injuries to the lower extremities on that grass field than on artificial turf in some NFL stadiums.\nSo the Titans, along with the local governments that own the stadium, made a decision they said would improve safety and would be supported by the data. Before the start of the 2023 season, they converted the playing surface to a version of monofilament synthetic turf called Matrix Helix.\n\"From an injury prevention perspective, that was a logical decision to make,\" said Jeff Miller, the NFL's executive vice president for communications, public affairs and policy.\nThe verdict rankled the NFLPA, however, and left the NFL and Titans to explain why turf -- long associated with higher injury rates and elevated wear and tear on players -- was the best option. It also illustrated the complex nature of an increasingly public issue between the league and its players, one that arises every time a prominent player suffers a significant injury on turf. There have been several recently, including Buffalo Bills star linebacker Matt Milano suffering an injury to his right leg Sunday that will require surgery.\nAfter New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers tore his left Achilles on the turf at MetLife Stadium on Sept. 11, NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell called on owners to convert all 30 stadiums to grass. In subsequent interviews with players, league and union officials, along with unaffiliated experts, ESPN worked to understand whether Howell's request is a possibility, why the two sides are interpreting their shared data so differently and whether plans for the 2026 World Cup will provide a more agreeable way forward. It's a topic that transcends data for players, who notice a dramatic difference in how their bodies react on different surfaces.\n• Can Chiefs solve the Kadarius Toney puzzle?\n• How Jim Schwartz transformed Browns D\n• 49ers receivers block before catching passes\n• Seahawks trends: Run D, Smith-Njigba\n• Texans 'very close' to getting Pierce on track\n• 15 catches?! How Chase set Bengals record\nFIFA's financial investment in ensuring the World Cup is played on grass -- even in NFL venues that feature turf -- raises the issue of the role money plays in the grass vs. turf debate. It's estimated a natural grass field could cost a cold-weather team $2 million to $3 million per year to maintain, including $400,000 each time it's replaced, according to a professor of turfgrass research at Michigan State. Turf would cost approximately $1.25 million to install and maintain, according to the Capital Improvement Board, which operates Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Prices, however, vary per market.\nThere are 30 NFL stadiums, including two shared by two teams, and they are split evenly, with 15 featuring various forms of grass and 15 using different types of synthetic turf. Aside from the improvements in turf technology, the argument against converting all 30 to grass includes the facts that most stadiums are publicly owned, those municipalities often hold events throughout the year, and the cheaper option is turf. There are also disparate weather conditions, and the combination of those factors requires 30 individual cases to determine whether grass, turf or some combination of the two is the most appropriate playing surface.\n\"We can't just say 'hybrid,'\" said Jeff Crandall, chair of the NFL's engineering committee. \"We can't just say 'grass,' and we can't just say 'synthetic.' That is not the answer. We've got to figure out what particular composition is best given the circumstances involved.\"\nThe NFL says improvements in turf technology have closed the gap on noncontact lower-extremity injury rates and revealed last year that the rates during the 2021 season were statistically even. But as the NFLPA pointed out months later, the gap increased during the 2022 season (.048 per 100 plays on turf in 2022, 0.035 on grass).\nNFLPA president JC Tretter said \"it shouldn't be this hard,\" and believes it is \"pretty obvious\" grass would protect players best wherever it is possible.\n\"We feel the data has proven our point,\" Tretter told ESPN. \"We feel the player opinion is consistent. There are, really, only two bodies of people that are disagreeing at this point with us: People who manufacture turf, and the NFL. And that's a frustrating spot to be in.\"\nThe perception of artificial turf as dangerous is so entrenched in NFL history that it's referenced in the common term for a specific injury: turf toe, which occurs when the big toe sticks in the turf and hyperextends while the rest of the body moves forward.\nThe term dates back to the original artificial turf that was widespread in the NFL during the 1970s. AstroTurf, named for the surface installed in Houston's Astrodome, was essentially carpet with a rough texture that was laid over concrete. It has since been replaced by today's versions engineered to better mimic grass and dirt. It uses fibers and infill -- the material that kicks in the air on slow-motion replays as a wide receiver drags his feet inbounds. And there are pads underneath to soften impact when a player falls.\nBut grass remains the clear preference of players, despite the data set cited by the NFL in guiding the Titans' shift from grass to turf. The NFL, however, does not release injury data about specific stadiums to the public.\nThe safety statistics are generated through the CBA-mandated Field Surface Safety and Performance Committee, which meets twice yearly and includes experts selected by both the NFL and NFLPA, in addition to their respective medical officers. To help identify injuries potentially caused by the playing surface, the committee focuses on noncontact injuries suffered in the lower extremities. In each of the past 11 years, the injury rate has been higher on turf, though in 2021 the figures were close enough that the difference was statistically insignificant (.042 per 100 plays on turf, .041 on grass).\nNFL injury rates, grass vs turf. 2018-22. \nSource: NFLPA\nThe NFLPA called the 2021 data an outlier, and players are becoming increasingly outspoken on this topic.\n\"It's pretty simple: The numbers say that grass is healthier for the players,\" Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said. \"I want to play on the best surface that will keep me healthy.\"\nGreen Bay Packers tackle David Bakhtiari said: \"We already play a violent game, so why increase the risk?\"\nNFL officials don't dispute the relevance of the data on playing surfaces but say it represents only a portion of a more holistic approach to reduce lower extremity injuries, one that includes better equipment, smarter training habits and better monitoring of exertion levels.\n\"Our goal is to reduce lower extremity injuries, period,\" said Crandall. \"And we need to do that on all surfaces, regardless of what it is.\"\nTretter, who played eight years as an NFL offensive lineman, remembers being hooked up to an ice machine to relieve the pain from playing on turf.\n\"I knew playing the week after was going to be extra difficult because of the wear and tear and the pounding my knees were going to take on turf,\" he said. \"And then I'd look at the worst-case scenario: A turf game [on Sunday], and then if that Thursday we had to play a game and that was turf, too.\n\"I knew I was going to be hooked up to an ice machine, unable to move, for the next 10 days after that. ... I think it's damn near unanimous amongst players what their experience tells us.\"\nThis story was reported and written by ESPN's Kevin Seifert, Anthony Olivieri and Stephen Holder. Jordan Raanan, Rich Cimini, Rob Demovsky and Adam Teicher contributed to this report.\nTretter also said when he was rehabilitating after a knee surgery while playing for the Cleveland Browns in 2020, athletic trainers would instruct him to take a day off from rehab rather than use the indoor turf field at the Browns' facility.\nIndianapolis Colts linebacker Zaire Franklin, meanwhile, said he knows how his body feels after working on turf compared to grass.\n\"We just did a walk-through on turf, and just being out there, I'm like, 'Man, I could feel it,'\" he said. \"I feel it in my legs. ... You could feel a difference in your body.\n\"I even talk to coaches when they're at practice and they're standing on the sideline. Their body feels different whether we practice on turf or grass, and they're not even running. They're just standing. So, if that's happening to them and they're just watching, what do you think is happening to the guys that are actually pounding their feet on it?\"\nIt's possible to quantify injuries. What's harder to quantify is how players feel after playing on turf. For the players, that is as much of a problem as the injuries attributed to artificial surfaces.\nThe NFL and NFLPA use an impact test to measure how hard or soft turf is, and according to Crandall, the NFL's engineering committee conducted a survey in 2022 to see if player perception matched the test results.\nThe results were \"inverse,\" Crandall said. In other words, surfaces that tested as hard felt soft to players who participated in the survey, and vice versa.\n\"So there is a disconnect,\" Crandall said. \"We're listening to the players. Clearly if we just made fields harder or softer, we're not capturing the feedback. ... We certainly don't minimize the feedback from the players and we realize, hey, this is something they have to play on every day, and we need to account for that, but there is no one out there currently that has the metric that says this is what you want a field to do that would align with their perception from a biomechanical standpoint.\"\nA potential modification for the test is under \"active research,\" Crandall said.\nThe NFLPA filed a grievance in January over what it said was the NFL's decision to play a Week 16 game in 2022 between the Detroit Lions and Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, despite a test result that indicated the field was too hard to play on.\nAsked about Crandall's comments regarding last year's study, Tretter said: \"If they cared about hardness, I don't think that Carolina game goes on without an hourlong delay to let the sunlight warm up the field, so guys aren't running on what's equivalent to concrete. But they chose not to, and that's in their discretion to choose not to. But it also shows you what they think about health and safety issues and hardness issues.\"\nMark Drakos is an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and an assistant team doctor for the New York Knicks and the New York Mets. He had a fellowship with the Giants and was on the committee charged with making a recommendation about different synthetic turf surfaces for MetLife Stadium -- home of the Giants and Jets -- prior to its inaugural season in 2010. Drakos said grass wasn't an option. The two teams had played on synthetic turf for all but three seasons since they began sharing the old Giants Stadium when it opened in 1976. Drakos wasn't in the room when the surface was chosen, but he gave his opinion ahead of time. \"Me and probably six or seven other doctors were sitting there listening to all these different presentations [from turf companies],\" Drakos said. \"And at the end, I said, 'Listen, from a medical standpoint, we should do grass.'\"\nMetLife stuck with synthetic turf because \"natural grass did not hold up for the busy fall schedule with two teams, 20 NFL home games, and the Northeast climate,\" according to Helen Strus, VP of marketing and communications for MetLife Stadium.\nBut then and now, Drakos' research found grass is best for players' health, particularly when it comes to ankle and noncontact knee injuries. He said: \"The data is pretty conclusive.\" He also said turf is stickier and less forgiving, which can cause the foot to catch and send torque up to the knee.\nThis year, the American Journal of Sports Medicine examined 53 studies, across all sports and levels of competition, published from 1972 to 2020. Twenty-five of them compared foot and ankle injuries on different surfaces, and 32 examined knee injury rates on both synthetic turf and grass. In summary, they found that there are \"a higher rate of foot and ankle injuries on artificial turf compared with natural grass on both old- and new-generation turf,\" and that \"elite-level football athletes\" were more predisposed to knee injuries on synthetic turf. The AJSM said there were \"a few\" studies that sided with turf on overall injury rates.\n\"The artificial turf industry has been vehement,\" said Diana Zuckerman, president of National Center for Health Research, \"and they've made a lot of money claiming that their product is perfectly safe, and there's really growing evidence that that's not true. And it's clear that even in the most recent types of artificial turf ... the accidents are still more likely to occur.\"\n\"Synthetic turf is a highly researched product that communities, athletic departments and sports organizations alike -- from youth fields to the professional level -- choose due to the consistent playing surface it provides,\" said Melanie Taylor, president and CEO of Synthetic Turf Council, the national trade association for the synthetic turf industry. \"Every aspect of our fields have been reviewed by independent experts and multi-government bodies.\" Out of 30 NFL stadiums, only five are owned by the team's owner. The rest are owned -- and in some cases operated -- by local governments or their designees. Some NFL stadiums host more than 200 events per year, most notably domes such as U.S. Bank Stadium in Minnesota and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\nIn some cases, teams have said weather conditions make a grass field difficult. In announcing their decision to shift to turf, for example, the Titans said Nashville is in a \"transition climate zone\" that makes grass difficult to grow in the fall and winter.\n\"There's been a grass field I've played on that was probably worse than a turf field,\" Vikings defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said. \"It's not a one-size-fits-all easy thing. I understand it's a complex issue.\"\nThe difference between injury rates on bad grass versus artificial turf are relatively low, according to Christina Mack, the chief scientific officer of IQVIA, which compiles NFL health data. Mack said the reduction in injuries is in the \"low single-digit numbers\" in such situations.\n\"That gets to the heart of the complexity of the issue,\" she said.\nSome players have noted individual injuries they believe were caused by bad grass. Chicago Bears safety Eddie Jackson blamed the field at Soldier Field for a 2018 ankle injury that cost him two regular-season games as well as the Bears' wild-card playoff appearance that season. Also in 2018, then-Houston Texans pass-rusher Jadeveon Clowney said an inconsistent pocket of grass in Houston caused a knee injury. The Texans replaced the grass with turf after that season.\nTretter questioned whether some teams are doing everything they can, noting that cold-weather teams in Green Bay, Cleveland and Pittsburgh all have grass fields. The Packers use a hybrid version known as SISGrass, which reinforces the natural surface with synthetic stitching. According to the Packers website, fibers are sewn three-quarters of an inch from each other and seven inches deep, sticking up just under an inch above the ground. They are intended to provide a stabilization for the sand underneath the field, preventing the ground from getting pushed around and becoming uneven over the course of a long season. Also, as part of their operation of Lambeau Field, the Packers typically limit themselves to one non-Packers event on the field per year.\n\"Guys get really, really frustrated when those teams pitch the idea that it's too hard to grow grass,\" Tretter said. \"If you can grow grass in Green Bay, Wisconsin, you can't tell me in Tennessee you can't handle it.\"\nThere have been several changes to stadium surfaces in 2023. In addition to the Texans' conversion, two stadiums -- MetLife and Detroit's Ford Field -- removed what's known as \"slit film\" turf and replaced it with a style called \"monofilament.\"\nLast year, the NFLPA called for the \"immediate replacement and ban\" of slit film turf because injury rates were consistently higher.\nFor the 2023 season, slit film remains in three stadiums (U.S. Bank Stadium in Minnesota, Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis and Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati). Minnesota and Indianapolis are scheduled for replacement in 2024. It was used for the annual NFL games played at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but that surface was changed prior to the 2023 season. Still, the field drew the ire of Bills players Sunday amid a series of injuries, including the one to Milano. The Baltimore Ravens face the Tennessee Titans on Sunday at the stadium.\nIn the long term, the NFLPA is focused on efforts to install temporary hybrid grass fields in seven NFL stadiums that currently have artificial turf as part of FIFA's requirements for hosting the 2026 World Cup.\n\"When the World Cup comes around,\" Tretter said, \"and these teams and these owners will roll out green grass for the European soccer teams to play on, and then replace it right back with turf for the employees, I feel like it's going to be a damning moment for this league because it will show you exactly how decisions are made. Decisions are made about how they can bring in money, and if they need to put in grass to make money, they will. And if they're going to roll out turf to make money, they'll do that.\"\nIt was announced at the 2023 Sports Field Management Association conference that Trey Rogers, a professor of turfgrass research at Michigan State, and John Sorochan, a co-director at the University of Tennessee Center for Athletic Field Safety, are both working for FIFA. The governing body has funded their research into temporary turfgrass fields for the 2026 World Cup.\nTaron Johnson hammered the turf at Hotspur Stadium. Said his foot stuck in the ground. That's why he got hurt. Also thinks it was a factor in other injuries today. \"That turf is terrible. Take it out.\"#Bills pic.twitter.com/TUt3XVwbUn\nRogers said that in 2010, when MetLife opened, they didn't have the same natural turfgrass technologies as they do now to maintain, say, a battered December field in a cold climate, or one inside a dome. He also said resodding processes are superior, and the way sod is now produced, harvested and laid can mean installation on a Friday before games on a Sunday.\nSorochan said at the conference he's looking to develop systems for the three retractable-roof NFL stadiums that will be used in the World Cup -- AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas; NRG Stadium in Houston; and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta -- that include grow lights and a ventilation system that circulates air to keep grass growing indoors. (A fourth facility, SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, has open sides but is covered by a translucent roof known as ETFE.)\nThe NFL's Miller said there have been \"a couple\" of meetings between the league and FIFA regarding the surface transition and that those talks will continue. But he noted the \"case uses are different,\" most notably the differences in the duration of time necessary to maintain. An NFL season is at least five months, compared to the World Cup's four weeks.\nSorochan, who is a consultant for the NFLPA for field safety and performance, said that process is possible for an NFL season, but there's one major challenge.\n\"It'll cost money,\" he said. \"Everything costs money, but everything's possible.\""}

(0:38)\nThe Miami Dolphins hosted the New York Giants on Sunday, one day after the Miami Hurricanes hosted Georgia Tech on the same field -- in the rain -- at Hard Rock Stadium. In past years, depending on the weather, that kind of doubleheader sometimes led to tough field conditions for the NFL teams.\nMultiple tenants is just one of the challenges facing NFL teams as they try to ensure optimal playing surfaces.\nHard Rock Stadium is one of 15 NFL stadiums that uses natural grass, while the other 15 feature various types of synthetic turf. The grass-turf debate has heated up again in the wake of New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers' injury suffered in MetLife Stadium, which prompted the NFLPA to call for grass fields at all stadiums.\nHere is a look at all 30 NFL stadiums -- two are shared by two teams -- including what surface is used, whether any changes have been made or are planned, what other events are held there and what issues may have arisen.\nJump to:\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\nStadium: Highmark Stadium\nField surface: A-Turf Titan 50 (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The Bills are building a new Highmark Stadium across the street from the current one that will have natural grass. Since the stadium opened in 1973, artificial turf (in varying forms) has been used. There are no plans to switch the field surface at the existing stadium before the new stadium opens (expected opening, 2026 season).\nField-related issues: Bills players and coach Sean McDermott have spoken in favor of natural grass when asked recently, but there have been no major recent issues with Highmark's turf.\nOther events held here: No major events during the season\nStadium owner: Erie County\n-- Alaina Getzenberg\nStadium: Hard Rock Stadium\nField surface: Natural Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? In 2019, the Dolphins acquired 80 acres of land near West Palm Beach for the primary purpose of growing their own sod. Now, South Florida Sod Farm is the sole provider of natural grass for Hard Rock Stadium.\nField-related issues: The Dolphins share a field with the Miami Hurricanes, and on multiple occasions have played home games on the same weekend as the Canes. In 2018, shortly before South Florida Sod Farms was established, a heavy rainstorm left the field at Hard Rock Stadium in sloppy condition, prompting concerns from multiple NFL entities. The incident exacerbated longstanding criticisms about the field conditions at Hard Rock Stadium.\nOther events held here: Miami Hurricanes home games\nStadium owner: Dolphins owner Stephen Ross\n-- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nStadium: Gillette Stadium\nField surface: FieldTurf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? Last change to most advanced form of FieldTurf was in 2021\nField-related issues: Nothing lately. The Patriots installed new turf in September 2011 after complaints about the previous turf, which had been installed four months earlier, being too soft.\nOther events held here: New England Revolution soccer and concerts\nStadium owner: Patriots owner Robert Kraft and family\n-- Mike Reiss\nStadium: MetLife Stadium\nField surface: FieldTurf Core System (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? This is the first season for the monofilament turf. It replaced slit-film turf. NFLPA president JC Tretter called for a ban on slit-film turf, citing safety concerns.\nField-related issues: Plenty with the old turf, which had been the subject of multiple complaints, including by the San Francisco 49ers after five players suffered lower-body injuries in the same game during the 2020 season. The knee injuries suffered by Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas were season-ending. Last season, the Ravens were unhappy after cornerback Kyle Fuller tore an ACL at MetLife in Week 1.\nOther events held here: Aside from two professional football teams, there are college and high school football games played during the season.\nStadium owner: The Giants and Jets are co-owners\n-- Jordan Raanan\nStadium: M&T Bank Stadium\nField surface: Natural grass. It's a new strain that was developed on a sod farm in North Carolina. It's a mixture of Bermuda and rye.\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The Ravens switched from an artificial surface in 2016. The change was made after the players made it known that they preferred grass. The Ravens use special artificial lights and lamps to keep grass growing where the field is shaded, particularly in the winter months.\nOther events held here: Occasional games for Navy and the University of Maryland\nStadium owner: Maryland Stadium Authority (Ravens are under lease through at least the 2037 season)\n-- Jamison Hensley\nStadium: Paycor Stadium\nField surface: Synthetic turf with slit-film fibers\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The current turf was installed in 2018.\nField-related issues: NFLPA president JC Tretter called for a ban on slit film turf, citing safety concerns.\nOther events held here: Concerts, but not during the season\nStadium owner: Hamilton County. The decision on what playing surface is used is a collaborative effort between the county and the team, per the provisions of the original lease. The county pays for the playing surface replacement, which occurs every six to eight years.\n-- Ben Baby\nStadium: Cleveland Browns Stadium\nField surface: Natural Kentucky Bluegrass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No, although ownership has been talking with city leaders about a stadium renovation.\nOther events held here: No.\nStadium owner: City of Cleveland\n-- Jake Trotter\nStadium: Acrisure Stadium\nField surface: Natural Kentucky Bluegrass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No.\nField-related issues: While players prefer natural grass, the field at Acrisure Stadium tends to get worn down throughout the season because the Steelers share the stadium with Pitt. There are several occasions when the college team hosts a game on Saturday, and the Steelers host a game the following day. In Week 1, several Steelers players slipped against the 49ers, but they all said the playing surface was fine. The day before, Pitt hosted Cincinnati, and it rained throughout the weekend.\nOther events held here: Pitt football\nStadium owner: Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County\n-- Brooke Pryor\nStadium: NRG Stadium\nField surface: Hellas Matrix Turf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? Changed from grass in 2015\nField-related issues: There were complaints about the old grass surface, but no controversy with the turf.\nOther events held here: Concerts, such as Beyonce on Sept. 23-24 when the Texans were playing in Jacksonville.\nStadium owner: Harris County Sports and Convention Corporation\n-- DJ Bien-Aime\nStadium: Lucas Oil Stadium\nField surface: Synthetic turf with slit-film fibers\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? Slated to be changed in March 2024 to monofilament turf, which is preferable to players\nField-related issues: Lucas Oil Stadium has ranked among the playing surfaces players most dislike. The NFLPA has pushed for slit-film fields to be eliminated.\nOther events held here: Numerous concerts and various football games, such as the Big Ten championship\nStadium owner: The Capital Improvement Board, a public entity that oversees the stadium and the Indiana Convention Center.\n-- Stephen Holder\nStadium: EverBank Stadium\nField surface: Natural Tifway 419 Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? It has always been grass, and there is no thought of going to an artificial surface.\nOther events held here: College games such as Florida-Georgia and the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl\nStadium owner: City of Jacksonville\n-- Michael DiRocco\nStadium: Nissan Stadium\nField surface: Matrix Helix Turf with organic infill (coconut/cork), instead of black shredded rubber (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? Grass was used before this season.\nField-related issues: The Titans said the old grass surface was inconsistent and undependable, and that Nissan Stadium had among the most lower-body injuries of any stadium in the league, which prompted the change to turf.\nOther events held here: Concerts, Music City Bowl, Tennessee State University football games\nStadium owner: Metropolitan government of Nashville and Davidson County.\n-- Turron Davenport\nStadium: Empower Field at Mile High\nField surface: Natural Kentucky Bluegrass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No. At times they've replaced some or all of the grass late in the season. In 2022, they replaced the grass on the entire field for the regular-season finale.\nField-related issues: The look of the grass, at times, has been an issue late in the season, but the team has routinely replaced parts, or all, of the field. The Broncos try not to play home games the same week of other events at the stadium.\nOther events held here: Concerts, the state high school football championship games, World Cup-level soccer friendlies, professional lacrosse and Colorado has faced Colorado State in the annual matchup.\nStadium owner: The Metropolitan Stadium District owns the stadium, but in the agreement with the team, the Broncos own the management company that operates the stadium and schedules events. The Broncos have paid for the field replacements through the years, and the field is heated to keep the grass growing when it gets colder.\n-- Jeff Legwold\nStadium: Arrowhead Stadium\nField surface: Natural Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No. The turf was switched from artificial to grass in 1994 and it's been grass ever since.\nOther events held here: Concerts\nStadium owner: Jackson County, Missouri\n-- Adam Teicher\nStadium: Allegiant Stadium\nField surface: Natural Bermuda grass on a tray that is pulled in and out of the domed stadium with a translucent roof.\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The stadium opened in 2020, and the Raiders used the Cardinals' idea of a grass tray being pulled in and out of the stadium for game day. A natural grass field was a prerequisite by Raiders owner Mark Davis.\nField-related issues: It has looked beaten up late in seasons, but that's it. The Super Bowl is coming in February.\nOther events held here: Concerts, international soccer and college football. The Raiders and soccer games use grass, but all others use turf.\nStadium owner: Las Vegas Stadium Authority\n-- Paul Gutierrez\nStadium: SoFi Stadium\nField surface: Artificial Matrix Turf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No.\nField-related issues: Seattle Seahawks J.C. Jackson and DK Metcalf suffered non-contact knee injuries on the field during a Week 7 game in 2022. Jackson ruptured a patellar tendon and was out for the remainder of the season. Seattle coach Pete Carroll and many players took to social media to question the safety of turf fields.\nOther events held here: Concerts, Rams games\nStadium owner: Stan Kroenke, Rams owner\n-- Kris Rhim\nStadium: AT&T Stadium\nField surface: Hellas Matrix Turf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? This is the first year with the surface.\nField-related issues: When the stadium opened in 2009, some players said the surface was too hard, but there were no real issues.\nOther events held here: Concerts, high school and college football games that have a different artificial surface because of the hashmarks. There are also stadium tours when fans can go on the field.\nStadium owner: The city of Arlington. Technically, the Cowboys are a tenant but they have operating control of the stadium.\n-- Todd Archer\nStadium: MetLife Stadium\nField surface: FieldTurf Core System (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? This is the first season for the monofilament turf. It replaced slit-film turf. NFLPA president JC Tretter called for a ban on slit-film turf, citing safety concerns.\nField-related issues: Plenty with the old turf, which had been the subject of multiple complaints, including by the San Francisco 49ers after five players suffered lower-body injuries in the same game during the 2020 season.

Last season, the Ravens were unhappy after cornerback Kyle Fuller tore an ACL at MetLife in Week 1.\nOther events held here: Aside from two professional football teams, there are college and high school football games played during the season.\nStadium owner: The Giants and Jets are co-owners of the stadium.\n-- Jordan Raanan\nStadium: Lincoln Financial Field\nField surface: Natural Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No.\nOther events held here: Temple football, concerts\nStadium owner: City of Philadelphia\n-- Tim McManus\nStadium: FedEx Field\nField surface: GameonGrass sod, a style of natural Bermuda grass grown in North Carolina\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The field was renovated for the 2021 season, adding new sod, new sand and improving the drainage and irrigation system.\nField-related issues: There were plenty of issues before the sod was installed. The surface was known to be one of the worst in the NFL, leading to numerous issues, particularly from 2013-20. Former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III and Seattle defensive end Chris Clemons tore ACLs in the same January 2013 playoff game with Clemons' agent blaming the \"crappy\" surface. Former Washington offensive lineman Tyler Polumbus tweeted in 2017 that the field \"is a joke and a danger.\"\nOther events held here: Soccer matches, college football, concerts\nStadium owner: The Commanders\n-- John Keim\nStadium: Soldier Field\nField surface: Natural Tahoma 31 Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? Switched from Kentucky bluegrass to Bermuda grass for the first time ahead of the 2022 season.\nField-related issues: The new grass has been free of controversy, which is rare for Soldier Field. In August 2021, after an Elton John concert chopped up the grass, the Bears hosted a preseason game against Kansas City. The surface was so bad that NFLPA president JC Tretter called for the league 'to reevaluate what is an acceptable surface.'\nOther events held here: Most concerts are held during the summer months/preseason and don't overlap with a Bears game the next day. Artist Karol G played a concert at Soldier Field on Sept. 15, the weekend the Bears were at Tampa Bay. The Chicago Fire (MLS) have a handful of games in September and October. The USWNT played South Africa on Sept. 24, when the Bears played in Kansas City.\nStadium owner: Chicago Park District\n-- Courtney Cronin\nStadium: Ford Field\nField surface: FieldTurf Core (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The surfaces at Ford Field and the Allen Park practice facility were changed from slit-film turf to a monofilament field turf ahead of the 2023 season.\nField-related issues: The Lions installed the new turf after the Players Association called for a ban on slit-film turf. The monofilament is considered the most grass-like style.\nOther events held here: Concerts, college football games, Monster Jam and WWE SummerSlam 2023 in August.\nStadium owner: The Detroit/Wayne County Stadium Authority\n-- Eric Woodyard\nStadium: Lambeau Field\nField surface: Natural Kentucky Bluegrass and SISGrass polyethylene fibers\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? It was changed in 2018.\nOther events held here: There is not more than one -- and sometimes there aren't any -- non-Packers game/practice events at Lambeau Field. The last concert was in 2019 (Paul McCartney). The last sporting event was Bayern Munich vs. Manchester City in 2022. Wisconsin and Notre Dame are scheduled to play at Lambeau in 2026.\nStadium owner: City of Green Bay and Green Bay/Brown County Professional Stadium District. The stadium is operated and maintained solely by the team.\n-- Rob Demovsky\nStadium: U.S. Bank Stadium\nField surface: Global Artificial Turf, Xtreme Turf UBU Speed Series S5 (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? It is slated for replacement in 2024.\nField-related issues: It's the slit film version of artificial turf that the NFL/NFLPA data says has been a host to more injuries than grass.\nOther events held here: High school football playoffs in the fall, college baseball in the winter/spring, and conventions/concerts throughout. A total of more than 200 events per year.\nStadium owner: Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, a public body and political subdivision of the State of Minnesota.\n-- Kevin Seifert\nStadium: Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nField surface: FieldTurf's Core Field (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? New FieldTurf was installed in 2022.\nField-related issues: One issue is the stadium is required to have grass for the World Cup in 2026.\nOther events held here: The Atlanta United of the MLS, concerts and college football.\nStadium owner: The state of Georgia, but it's run by the Arthur M. Blank Group.\n-- Michael Rothstein\nStadium: Bank of America Stadium\nField surface: FieldTurf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? BOA went from having one of the best grass surfaces in the NFL to FieldTurf in mid-2021, because the stadium was set to host the Charlotte FC of the MLS and owner David Tepper wanted to host more concerts. Publicly, no plans to change it back to grass have been announced.\n• Can Chiefs solve the Kadarius Toney puzzle?\n• How Jim Schwartz transformed Browns D\n• 49ers receivers block before catching passes\n• Seahawks trends: Run D, Smith-Njigba\n• Texans 'very close' to getting Pierce on track\n• 15 catches?! How Chase set Bengals record\nField-related issues: The NFL Players Association filed a grievance against the Panthers for poor field conditions after complaints by players following a 2022 Christmas Eve game against the Detroit Lions. There also were concerns after quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield sustained high ankle injuries at home last season. That the field was switched to grass for a soccer match against Chelsea only increased criticism from players. \"It's probably going to take all of us to stop going to practice until we get grass,\" linebacker Shaq Thompson said last season.\nOther events held here: BOA hosts the Charlotte FC of MLS and major music concerts.\nStadium owner: David Tepper, Panthers owner\n-- David Newton\nStadium: Caesar's Superdome\nField surface: UBU speed series s5-m synthetic turf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The Saints change the artificial turf every year, but coach Dennis Allen said they recently changed out the type of turf because the league highly encouraged this particular turf. One Saints player said the turf was noticeably longer and slower.\nField-related issues: Former Saints running back Mark Ingram said in an interview in 2022 that the Saints used one of the lowest-graded turfs, but he said owner Gayle Benson was someone he could approach about that.\nOther events held here: Concerts -- Beyonce played on Sept. 27 and Taylor Swift will play in-season next year, but the turf can be taken up.\nStadium owner: The state of Louisiana, managed by ASM Global\n-- Katherine Terrell\nStadium: Raymond James Stadium\nField surface: Natural Tifway 419 Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No.\nField-related issues: The field has consistently been rated one of the top playing surfaces in the NFL, but quarterback Aaron Rodgers blamed a calf injury in 2015 on the field conditions in Tampa.\nOther events held here: University of South Florida home football games, Gasparilla Bowl, ReliaQuest Bowl. There are concerts and Monster Jam, but not in-season.\nStadium owner: Hillsborough County\n-- Jenna Laine\nStadium: State Farm Stadium\nField surface: Natural Tifway 419, which is a type of Bermuda grass, on a rolling tray that moves the surface outside to get sun.\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? The NFL installed Tahoma 31, a popular strain of Bermuda grass, for Super Bowl LVII after tearing out the Cardinals' normal Tifway 419. Arizona has gone back to Tifway 419 for the season.\nField-related issues: Several players ripped the one-time-only surface after the Super Bowl, with Eagles DE Haason Reddick saying it was the worst field he's ever played on. Players found it tough to keep their footing and were slipping on the fresh grass. There have been no complaints this season about the grass.\nOther events held here: Concerts, college games and a winter fest during the Cardinals' season. A variety of other offseason events.\nStadium owner: Arizona Sports & Tourism Authority\n-- Josh Weinfuss\nStadium: SoFi Stadium\nField surface: Artificial Matrix Turf (artificial)\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No.\nField-related issues: Seattle Seahawks J.C. Jackson and DK Metcalf suffered noncontact knee injuries on the field during a Week 7 game in 2022. Jackson ruptured a patellar tendon and was out for the remainder of the season. Seattle coach Pete Carroll and many players took to social media to question the safety of turf fields.\nOther events held here: Concerts, Chargers games.\nStadium owner: Stan Kroenke, Rams owner\n-- Kris Rhim\nStadium: Levi's Stadium\nField surface: Natural Bermuda grass\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes? No.\nField-related issues: In the first two years of the stadium -- 2014-15 -- there were multiple issues with the grass not providing good footing. In 2014, the field had to be resodded after the first game because the footing was poor. In 2015, Ravens kicker Justin Tucker slipped on the grass, causing him to miss a field goal. And then-Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib said the surface was \"terrible\" following Denver's win in Super Bowl 50. There have been no issues in recent years, though.\nOther events held here: Concerts and the occasional college football game and soccer match. Taylor Swift and Beyonce performed at Levi's during the preseason and Ed Sheeran had a concert during Week 2.\nStadium owner: The stadium is publicly owned by the city of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara Stadium Authority, and it is operated by the 49ers.\n-- Nick Wagoner\nStadium: Lumen Field\nField surface: FieldTurf Revolution 360\nAny recent changes or plans to make changes?

{"title": "NBArank enters the top 50 -- and why two star guards plummeted", "date": "2023-10-11 15:30:31", "text": "Bradley Beal sits down with Malika Andrews to discuss his transition from the Wizards to a Suns team with heavy expectations. (0:32)\nNBArank is back for its 13th season counting down the best players in the league.\nWhich stars made and missed the cut? Which rookies are already making noise in the top 100? Where did MVP contenders such as Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and reigning winner Joel Embiid check in?\nWhere did LeBron James land as he enters season No. 21?\nTo get the final NBArank prediction, we asked our expert panel to vote on player vs. player matchups from more than 15,000 possible pairings. Voters were asked, \"Which player will be better in 2023-24?\" and had to predict how each player will perform this season.\nOne Tuesday, our countdown kicked off with players Nos. 100-51 and continues with Nos. 50-11, a list that includes two thirds of the new big three in Phoenix, a former MVP guard and one of the most-hyped rookies in NBA history.\nNote: ESPN's NBArank panel, comprising nearly 150 reporters, editors, producers and analysts, was asked to rank players based on their predicted contributions -- quality and quantity -- for the 2023-24 season only.\nCleveland Cavaliers | C\n2022 NBArank: 52\nWhy he rose two spots: Allen remains a throwback center in today's jump-shooting NBA. But so long as the league has a handful of dominant big men still playing with a more traditional approach to the 5 in Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid, Allen will be a coveted player to try to stop them.\nSwing skill: Cleveland went 13-3 last season in games Allen recorded at least 10 rebounds and two blocks. Allen missed 14 games and the Cavs still finished No. 1 in defensive rating, allowing 109.9 points per 100 possessions. The more he can stay on the court and be aggressive protecting the paint, the higher the Cavaliers can climb.\n-- Dave McMenamin\nPortland Trail Blazers | C\n2022 NBArank: 51\nWhy he rose two spots: Drafted as the No. 2 option in Phoenix behind Devin Booker, Ayton saw his touches diminish more and more as Chris Paul, Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson and finally, Kevin Durant, were added to the mix. He should be more of a focal point in Portland.\nOne game to watch in 2023-24: Nov. 21 at Phoenix. The Blazers visit the Suns a couple of days before Thanksgiving, and Ayton will get his first chance to feast against his former team. The former No. 1 pick helped the Suns reach their first NBA Finals in nearly 30 years in 2021, but the blockbuster trade that sent Ayton to Portland could work out for both sides, as the developing 25-year-old center will surely get more touches now than he would have with the win-now Suns squad.\n-- McMenamin\nCharlotte Hornets | PG\n2022 NBArank: 41\nWhy he fell seven spots: A series of ankle injuries limited Ball to 36 games and dropped the Hornets toward the cellar. Ball's per-game stats improved from 2021-22, when he made his All-Star debut at age 20, but he inevitably suffered what ESPN's Zach Lowe described as a \"looseness\" to his game at both ends.\n• Nos. 50-11: Wemby, Trae and Beal in top 50\n• Insiders: Who are biggest risers, fallers?\n• Nos. 100-51: Where's Zion?\n• Pelton: The next wave is coming\n• Coming Thursday: Nos. 10-1\nWhy he could exceed his ranking: Ball has healed up and just recently turned 22, an age at which players develop rapidly. With the return of Miles Bridges (after his 10-game suspension for pleading no contest on a felony charge of domestic violence), Ball will have more support. He's an easy bet to move up next year.\n-- Kevin Pelton\nSan Antonio Spurs | PF\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he debuts at No. 47: Wembanyama is unlike any prospect we've seen enter the NBA. Wembanyama averaged 21.6 points, 10.4 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game in the French Pro A League last season on his way to winning MVP honors. Still, how much of that translates to the NBA right away remains to be seen.\nOne huge question for the season: How exactly will the Spurs use Wembanyama? Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said one of the cool questions to be answered in training camp is figuring out if Wembanyama is a power forward, center or even a small forward. Wembanyama said there are no limitations on his role. What's clear is that San Antonio will use the rookie in different ways.\n-- Andrew Lopez\nMilwaukee Bucks | SF\n2022 NBArank: 31\nWhy he fell 15 spots: Injuries derailed Middleton's 2022-23 season from the start. He did not play in his first game until December and played in just 33 games, never quite looking like the three-time All-Star Bucks fans had grown accustomed to in recent seasons. Yet, he returns to Milwaukee on a new three-year contract hoping for a bounce-back season.\nWhy he could exceed his ranking:  Staying on the floor will be a key factor for Middleton this season if he wants to climb back up this list. But his role in Milwaukee will also be much different this year after the team acquired Damian Lillard. Middleton can slide into his wing position as the No. 3 option and should benefit from the enormous attention Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo will command.\n-- Jamal Collier\nNew York Knicks | PF\n2022 NBArank: 71\nWhy he rose 26 spots: Randle bounced back from a disappointing 2021-22 season by once again making the All-Star and All-NBA teams and helping the Knicks not only return to the playoffs for a second time in three years, but win a playoff series for the first time in a decade.\nSwing skill: Randle's efficiency has yo-yoed from year to year with the Knicks. In the two years he has made the All-Star team, he has had an effective field goal percentage of over 50. In the year in between, it was under 46%, and the Knicks missed the playoffs. With how much he'll continue to have the ball under coach Tom Thibodeau, remaining an at least somewhat efficient player is going to be crucial for the Knicks to replicate last year's success.\n-- Tim Bontemps\nNew Orleans Pelicans | SG\n2022 NBArank: 45\nWhy he rose one spot: McCollum stays close to where he was a season ago simply because of the consistency he has shown throughout his NBA career. McCollum has averaged 20.0 PPG or more in eight consecutive seasons -- yet he hasn't been named an All-Star.\nWhy he could exceed this ranking: McCollum has had the longest offseason of his NBA career. For the first time, his team didn't make the playoffs. Both Pelicans executive David Griffin and coach Willie Green have talked about the outstanding shape McCollum has entered camp in.\n-- Lopez\nPhiladelphia 76ers | PG\n2022 NBArank: 11\nWhy he fell 32 spots: Harden led the NBA in assists for the second time in his career last season, forming a potent partnership with Joel Embiid. But he lacked the same sort of burst he displayed earlier in his career as a scorer, and Philadelphia once again saw its season end in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a heartbreaking seven-game loss to the Boston Celtics. Harden's trade request and uncertain future with the 76ers makes predicting the former MVP's impact this season a tricky task.\nOne huge question for the season: This one is simple: Where is Harden going to play this season? So far, it appears he will be in Philadelphia, despite asking for a trade away from the 76ers and calling the team's president of basketball operations, Daryl Morey, a \"liar\" this summer. But if Harden is on the court and engaged with the 76ers, they have a chance to compete with Milwaukee and Boston atop the East.\n-- Bontemps\nPhiladelphia 76ers | PG\n2022 NBArank: 44\nWhy he rose two spots: Maxey continued his impressive start to his career by eclipsing 20 PPG for the first time in his career and once again improving both his 3-point percentage (43.4) and his attempt rate (6.2 per game). If he can make a leap yet again this season, he could put himself in contention for an All-Star spot.\nOne huge question for the season: What will Maxey's role be this season? Not surprisingly, that answer is tied in part to the fate of Harden in Philadelphia. If Harden is around, Maxey will remain in a role as a secondary playmaker focused more on scoring. If Harden is either traded or not playing, however, Maxey will need to take significant steps forward as a playmaker for Philadelphia to remain a threat in the East. Improvement in that area is something he has stated as a goal for this season, and worked on this summer.\n-- Bontemps\nGolden State Warriors | SG\n2022 NBArank: 37\nWhy he fell four spots: Thompson didn't drop in the rankings because of a down year. He did have a slow start to the season, but he led the league with 301 made 3-pointers. For Thompson, it's about adapting his game as he gets older and as other guards come up in the league.\nOne huge question for the season: Can he make the kind of defensive impact he used to? Thompson used to be an elite two-way player. And no, it's not entirely fair to compare the pre-ACL and Achilles-injured Thompson to who he is now, but his defense will be very important. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he expects Thompson to guard opposing 4s more often this year, so if he can battle bigger players with the same tenacity he used to have and pair it with his shooting, the Warriors will have a major boost.\n-- Kendra Andrews\nCleveland Cavaliers | PF\n2022 NBArank: 36\nWhy he fell four spots: After looking like a future superstar during his rookie campaign, Mobley was solid in his sophomore season but didn't unlock a new level to his game as quickly as the Cavs hoped.\nWhy he could exceed this ranking: Mobley's statistics improved across the board from his rookie season to his sophomore campaign, and the 7-footer is still only 22 years old. After the Cavs' roster improved around the margins in the offseason, adding Max Strus and Georges Niang, Mobley's efficiency should only get sharper with those floor spacers making it harder for opposing defenses to pack the paint to stop him.\n-- McMenamin\nChicago Bulls | SF\n2022 NBArank: 28\nWhy he fell 11 spots: It would have been hard for DeRozan to follow up on a career year during his first season in Chicago, but DeRozan was still an All-Star in his second season with the Bulls. However, the Bulls did not win at the same level as they did two seasons ago.\nOne huge question for his season:  DeRozan is entering the final season of his contract with the Bulls, although both he and the team have expressed interest in an extension. However, if the Bulls do not have more success this season after missing the playoffs in 2022-23, will DeRozan's tenure in Chicago continue?\n-- Collier\nChicago Bulls | SG\n2022 NBArank: 27\nWhy he fell 11 spots: LaVine was not himself at the start of last season after undergoing offseason knee surgery and did not play with the same offensive punch for most of the first half. But he picked it up after the All-Star break, averaging 27-5-4 down the stretch to get the Bulls into the play-in tournament.\nOne game to watch in 2023-24: Nov. 18 vs. Miami. It's the first chance the Bulls have to face the Heat after losing in the second play-in game. The Heat claimed the No. 8 seed as a result and went on to upset the top-seeded Bucks en route to the NBA Finals. Despite an excellent showing in the 9-10 play-in game win over Toronto, LaVine struggled against Miami.\n-- Collier\nPhoenix Suns | SG\n2022 NBArank: 19\nWhy he fell 18 spots: Beal went from being the No. 1 option with the Wizards to No. 3 for the Suns. His willingness and ability to sacrifice for the greater good will dictate whether this ranking was fair.\nNew face in new place:  Beal left the Washington Wizards just 160 points behind Elvin Hayes as the franchise's all-time leading scorer. He was Washington's sun, moon and stars for years. Now he's going to have to fit into a constellation that also includes Kevin Durant and Devin Booker. The title expectations should be a welcome change for Beal after he won only three playoff series in 11 seasons with the Wizards.\n-- McMenamin\nCleveland Cavaliers | PG\n2022 NBArank: 46\nWhy he rose 10 spots: Still just 23 years old, Garland has improved each of his first four seasons in the league. He was one of just six players in the NBA last season to average at least 21.6 points and 7.8 assists per game.\nSwing skill: Garland has hit the fifth-most 3s from 30 feet or beyond in league history, according to Stat Mamba, joining a group that includes LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Trae Young and Damian Lillard. That ability to stretch the floor and extend the defense also sets him up as a playmaker, as he's able to put the ball on the floor and find teammates when his defender overcommits (his 7.8 APG ranked 10th in the NBA).\n-- McMenamin\nMemphis Grizzlies | PG\n2022 NBArank: 9\nWhy he fell 26 spots: Morant's off-court issues have overshadowed his brilliant play on the floor. He missed out on an All-NBA selection last season -- and the supermax contract escalator it would have earned -- in large part because he served an eight-game suspension. He'll serve a 25-game suspension to start the season.\nOne game to watch in 2023-24: Dec. 19 at New Orleans, a game that was circled as soon as the schedule came out. That is the Grizzlies' 26th game of the season and Morant's debut, barring any more missteps that commissioner Adam Silver determines merit further disciplinary action.\n-- Tim MacMahon\nDallas Mavericks | PG\n2022 NBArank: 33\nWhy he fell one spot: A team-issued suspension and Brooklyn's eventual granting of Irving's trade request added to the eight-time All-Star's turbulent track record. But he remains one of the NBA's most skilled and productive guards, averaging 27.1 points and 5.5 APG with a 61.3 true shooting percentage last season.\nOne huge question for the season: Can Irving impact winning in Dallas? It didn't happen after his arrival in a midseason trade last season, when the Mavs fell from the middle of the West playoff pack to the lottery following the blockbuster deal with Brooklyn. Dallas has upgraded the supporting cast around Luka Doncic and Irving, especially defensively, and expects to be elite offensively with that duo leading the way.\n-- MacMahon\nBrooklyn Nets | SF\n2022 NBArank: 49\nWhy he rose 16 spots: Already valuable for his defense and spot-up shooting, Bridges added shot creation -- which accelerated after he was traded to Brooklyn. Already averaging a career-high 17.2 PPG in Phoenix, Bridges pushed that to 26.1 with the Nets, which would have ranked 16th in the NBA.\nSwing skill: Late-game scoring. Bridges played well in Brooklyn, but the missing piece was maintaining his shot creation down the stretch. In 36 clutch minutes (score within five in the last five minutes of regulation or OT) after the trade, Bridges scored 11 points on 2-of-9 shooting, per NBA Advanced Stats.\n-- Pelton\nNew York Knicks | PG\n2022 NBArank: 67\nWhy he rose 35 spots: Brunson was everything the Knicks ever could have hoped for -- and then some -- after joining them as a free agent from the Dallas Mavericks last summer. He set career-highs across the board, led the Knicks to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade and established himself as one of the biggest stars in the Big Apple.\nFriday, Oct. 13\nWarriors at Lakers, 10 p.m. (ESPN2)\nSunday, Oct. 15\nBucks at Lakers, 7 p.m.\nWarriors at Kings, 9:30 p.m.\nAll times Eastern\nSwing skill: After shooting 41.6% from 3-point range on more than 4.7 attempts per game -- a career-high -- if Brunson can again boost his 3-point rate, it will give him a chance to exceed his career year last season. After bumping his stats up across the board last season while taking on a bigger role, the goal for Brunson will be to prove he can do all of it again.\n-- Bontemps\nMemphis Grizzlies | PF\n2022 NBArank: 53\nWhy he rose 22 spots: Jackson made his first All-Star appearance, became the second-youngest Defensive Player of the Year winner and had by far the best offensive season of his career. At age 23, Jackson put up career-best numbers in scoring (18.6 PPG) and rebounding (6.8), and led the league in blocked shots (3.0).\nWhy he could exceed this ranking: Jackson has plenty of room to grow offensively and will get a lot of opportunity, especially while Morant serves his suspension for the first 25 games of the season. Jackson averaged 23.5 points in his last 18 games of 2022-23, shooting 53.2% from the floor and 39.3% from 3-point range in that span.\n-- MacMahon\nOrlando Magic | PF\n2022 NBArank: 82\nWhy he rose 52 spots: Banchero became the first No. 1 pick since Ben Simmons in 2017-18 to win Rookie of the Year, leading all first-year players with 20 PPG. Banchero especially excelled at drawing fouls. He was just the third rookie this century to average more than seven free throw attempts per game (7.4).\nOne game to watch in 2023-24: Jan. 13 at Oklahoma City. Chet Holmgren's Lisfranc injury -- suffered playing alongside Banchero in the CrawsOver pro-am -- prevented us from seeing the top two picks of last year's draft square off as rookies. This will be their first meeting since Banchero's Duke beat Holmgren's Gonzaga in November 2021.\n-- Pelton\nAtlanta Hawks | PG\n2022 NBArank: 16\nWhy he fell 13 spots: While Young saw an uptick in his assists to a career-best 10.2 per game, his efficiency was not the same with his field goal (42.9%) and 3-point percentages (33.5%) dropping to lows he hadn't seen since his rookie season.\nOne game to watch in 2023-24: March 5 at the Knicks. Broadway Trae makes only one visit to Madison Square Garden this season. After his playoff performance in 2021, Young's games visiting the Knicks are must-see TV. Young struggled there last season -- 17 points on 7-of-22 shooting and 19 points on 9-of-20 shooting -- but the promise of Young putting on a show is always there.\n-- Lopez\nUtah Jazz | PF\n2022 NBArank: NR\nWhy he rose from unranked: Markkanen emerged as an All-Star and earned the NBA's Most Improved Player award in his first season in Utah. His scoring average soared to 25.6 PPG, an increase of 10.8, which was the biggest jump in the league last season. His 16 30-point outings were one more than he had in his first five seasons combined.\nSwing skill: Markkanen proved last season that he's an all-around scorer, not just a 3-point threat, but that's still his best skill. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Markkanen became the first 7-footer ever to make at least 200 3s in a season, and he did so while shooting 39.2% from beyond the arc.\n-- MacMahon\nNew Orleans Pelicans | SF\n2022 NBArank: 29\nWhy he rose two spots: Despite his performance in the FIBA World Cup, there's some confidence that Ingram's NBA performance last season (24.7 points, 5.8 assists and 5.5 rebounds on .484/.390/.882 splits) will carry into the 2023-24 season. That player could be an All-NBA type if he stays on the court for more than 45 games like he did a season ago.\nWhy he could exceed his ranking: Here are the only players to put up the numbers Ingram did a season ago with the same shooting splits: Larry Bird (four times) and Stephen Curry. If Ingram stays healthy, he could return to being an All-Star like he was in 2019-20, his first season in New Orleans.\n-- Lopez\nBoston Celtics | PG\n2022 NBArank: 26\nWhy his ranking was unchanged: Holiday remained a steady two-way presence in 2022-23, emerging as Milwaukee's No. 2 option with Khris Middleton hampered by injuries, while remaining one of the league's best perimeter defenders.\nNew face in new place: After three years and a championship in Milwaukee, Holiday is now a member of the Boston Celtics. Holiday slots right into the point guard spot occupied by Marcus Smart for years and should be a strong complement next to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown on both sides of the ball.\n-- Collier\nToronto Raptors | PF\n2022 NBArank: 30\nWhy he rose five spots: Siakam led the NBA in minutes per game for a second consecutive season, putting up another impressive stat line while just missing out on an All-NBA spot -- one of the few bright spots in an otherwise disappointing season in Toronto that ended with a loss to the Bulls in the play-in tournament.\nOne huge question for the season: After Fred VanVleet left the Raptors as a free agent last summer, the fact that Siakam is entering the final year of his contract is going to be an ongoing storyline in Toronto this season. If the Raptors struggle under first-year coach Darko Rajakovic, Siakam's future -- and whether he'll be in Toronto after the trade deadline -- could easily become a big theme.\n-- Bontemps\nLA Clippers | SF\n2022 NBArank: 12\nWhy he fell 12 spots: Leonard started last season slowly after missing all of 2021-22 because of an ACL injury, then early-season injuries slowed him even more. But Leonard came on strong in January and returned to the dominant playoff form that made him a two-time Finals MVP, averaging 34.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists in Games 1 and 2 against Phoenix before his postseason was cut short by a right knee injury.\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Win projections for 30 teams\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nOne huge question for the season:  Leonard enters his fifth season as a Clipper but has played no more than 57 games in a season in L.A. Like Paul George, Leonard is eligible for an extension, but it appears the two stars will have to prove they can stay healthy and take the Clippers deep in the postseason. Can Leonard bounce back from a meniscus tear to the same right knee that suffered his ACL injury? And how will he handle the NBA's new player participation policy?\n-- Ohm Youngmisuk\nSacramento Kings | PG\n2022 NBArank: 54\nWhy he rose 31 spots: Fox's huge year helped propel him in our rankings. It also didn't hurt that, with Domantas Sabonis, Kevin Huerter, Harrison Barnes, Keegan Murray and Malik Monk, the Kings were the most complete team Fox has played with during his tenure in Sacramento. It led to the Kings snapping a 16-season playoff drought.\nOne huge question for the season: How can he follow up his breakout year? Fox was a first-time All-Star and named to the All-NBA third team. He also won the inaugural Clutch Player of the Year Award. His coach, Mike Brown, was named Coach of the Year. Fox's general manager, Monte McNair, was named Executive of the Year. Sacramento is looking to take another step forward. To do that, Fox has to take another leap as well.\n-- Andrews\nSacramento Kings | PF\n2022 NBArank: 47\nWhy he rose 25 spots: In his first full season in Sacramento, Sabonis became the Kings' engine, making everything click for the team on both ends on his way to his first All-NBA third-team selection and becoming one of the premier bigs in the league.\nSwing skill: While the Kings ranked 20th in the league in rebounding, Sabonis led all players in that category -- 12.3 per game and 973 total rebounds. And with the incredibly strong presence on the glass, Sabonis also converted 75% of his attempts at the rim on more than 500 attempts. With the addition of JaVale McGee and the return of Alex Len, Sacramento has good depth at the center spot and should have a dominant presence on the glass, but no one is better at that for the Kings than Sabonis.\n-- Andrews\nIndiana Pacers | PG\n2022 NBArank: 59\nWhy he rose 38 spots: Haliburton made his first All-Star game, averaged 20.7 points and 10.4 assists and shot 40% from 3 before signing a five-year rookie max extension, making him the face of the Pacers.\nSwing skill: Haliburton has emerged as one of the league's best passers. He nearly led the league in assists, averaging 10.4 per game (just behind James Harden's league-best 10.7) and earned praise for his playmaking with Team USA this summer.\n-- Collier\nMinnesota Timberwolves | C\n2022 NBArank: 13\nWhy he fell seven spots: Adjusting to the addition of Rudy Gobert, Towns was off to a slow offensive start when a serious calf injury sidelined him for nearly four months. His 37% 3-point shooting was his lowest since his rookie campaign, and Towns took a back seat offensively to budding star Anthony Edwards.\nWhy he could exceed his ranking:  It's entirely possible a healthy Towns will remind us why he was an All-NBA third-team pick in 2021-22. He represented the Dominican Republic in this summer's FIBA World Cup, and the Timberwolves have another training camp to figure out how he and Gobert can coexist.\n-- Pelton\nBoston Celtics | SG\n2022 NBArank: 22\nWhy he rose three spots: Brown posted career highs in PPG (26.6) and field goal percentage (49.1) to make his first All-NBA appearance. That earned him a five-year, $303.7 million supermax extension -- the largest in NBA history -- tying him to the Celtics for the next several years.\nOne huge question for the season: After shooting just under 40% on seven attempts from 3 per game two years ago, Brown dropped to 35.8% in 2021-22 and then down to 33.5% this past season on the same volume. If he can get back to around 40%, it would do a ton for his efficiency and make an already potent Celtics offense even more difficult to stop.\n-- Bontemps\nLA Clippers | SF\n2022 NBArank: 15\nWhy he fell three spots: PG returned to the All-Star Game last season and was playing some of his best basketball before Oklahoma City's Lu Dort collided with him and ultimately ended George's season with a sprained right knee in late March. George had three separate stretches where he missed five or more consecutive games due to injuries.\nOne huge question for the season:  George is entering his fifth year with the Clippers and would love to sign an extension. But he understands this is a pivotal season for LA, during which he and Kawhi Leonard have to prove they can not only stay healthy but meet championship expectations. George has vowed to be \"on my bully s---\" this season. Can he remain healthy for the entire season?\n-- Youngmisuk\nDenver Nuggets | PG\n2022 NBArank: 50\nWhy he rose 33 spots: \"Bubble Murray\" was no fluke. After sitting out the entire 2021-22 season with an ACL injury, Murray showed why he is one of the game's best when fully healthy, averaging 26.1 points, 7.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 39.6% shooting from 3 in 20 postseason games en route to Denver's title.\nWhy he could exceed his ranking:  Nuggets coach Michael Malone has challenged his point guard to build from his postseason tear and become a first-time All-Star and first-time All-NBA selection. If he does that, his rise through these rankings will continue.\n-- Youngmisuk\nMiami Heat | C\n2022 NBArank: 23\nWhy he rose seven spots: Adebayo averaged a career-high 20.4 PPG, earning his second career All-Star nod. Still, let's be clear: This move up the rankings is entirely about Adebayo's key role in the Heat's unlikely run to the NBA Finals.\nGet access to exclusive original series, premium articles from our NBA insiders, the full 30 for 30 library and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\nSwing skill: Defensive versatility. Adebayo excels matching up with smaller opponents after a switch. Of the seven regular seasons in the Second Spectrum era (back to 2013-14) where the player defending the screener has switched at least 500 times, Adebayo owns three of those marks -- each of the past three years.\n-- Pelton\nCleveland Cavaliers | SG\n2022 NBArank: 24\nWhy he rose nine spots: After topping the 40-point plateau nine times in his first five years in Utah, Mitchell did it 13 times in his first season in Cleveland, including his legendary 71-point night against Chicago. He can dominate on any given night.\nOne huge question for the season: Will this be Mitchell's last season in wine and gold? Mitchell opted against signing an extension with the franchise in the fall. While he's still under contract through 2024-25 (with a player option for 2025-26), if the Cavs don't make a leap this year after last season's first-round flameout, could Mitchell become a trade chip in the summer if an extension agreement isn't made then?\n-- McMenamin\nMilwaukee Bucks | PG\n2022 NBArank: 14\nWhy his ranking was unchanged: Lillard outplayed his ranking in the 58 games he played last season before being shut down with the Trail Blazers out of play-in competition, averaging a career-high 32.2 PPG and scoring 50-plus points three times. Only Lillard's age (33) prevented him from moving up this year.\nNew face in new place: In case you missed it, Lillard was traded to the Bucks, where he'll team with two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. There will be an adjustment period for both Lillard and Antetokounmpo, but they figure to develop unstoppable pick-and-roll chemistry.\n-- Pelton\nMinnesota Timberwolves | SG\n2022 NBArank: 25\nWhy he rose 12 spots: Edwards' star continues to ascend. After a slow start last season, he averaged a career-high 24.6 PPG, maintaining his efficiency while using 30% of the Timberwolves' plays. That earned Edwards his first All-Star appearance and a spot on Team USA's World Cup team, where he finished as its leading scorer.\nOne huge question for the season:  Is Edwards ready to make the leap into All-NBA territory? He certainly looked the part in Minnesota's competitive first-round loss to the eventual champion Nuggets, averaging 31.6 PPG. Having recently signed a max rookie extension, Edwards would add a projected $40 million-plus to his next deal by making All-NBA.\n-- Pelton\nMiami Heat | SF\n2022 NBArank: 17\nWhy he rose five spots: Did you watch the playoffs? If anything, Butler might still be too low. Only Antetokounmpo has been more valuable over the past four postseasons in terms of my wins above replacement player (WARP) metric than \"Playoff Jimmy.\" Butler also ranks sixth in the regular season in that span.\nOne huge question for the season:  Will age ever catch up with Butler? He turned 34 last month and recently surpassed 25,000 career regular-season minutes. It's rare for stars to peak as late as Butler has, but so far he shows no sign of slowing down.\n-- Pelton\nPhoenix Suns | SG\n2022 NBArank: 10\nWhy he fell one spot: On the verge of turning 27, traditionally looked at as the age when players enter their prime, Booker is a top-10-caliber talent. A dangerous scorer who has grown as a playmaker, Booker is simply one of the best the league has to offer, but the addition of star guard Bradley Beal could cap Booker's usage in 2023-24.\nOne huge question for the season: Can Booker make a run at MVP? He has already long been considered one of the most fundamentally sound players at his position, and after finishing fourth in voting for the award in 2021-22, his scoring, shooting percentage and assist averages all went up last year. The key will be staying on the floor: Booker missed 29 games because of injury last season.\n-- McMenamin"}
{"title": "Four up, four down: The NBArank futures of this year's biggest risers and fallers", "date": "2023-10-11 15:30:31", "text": "Adrian Wojnarowski weighs in on the future of the 76ers as they manage James Harden trade rumors leading up to the season. (1:43)\nWhat lies ahead for some of the biggest risers and fallers in NBArank 2023?\nOn Tuesday, our countdown began with the unveiling of players Nos. 100-51, while Wednesday continued with Nos. 50-11. (The top 10 drops on Thursday.)\nAmong our first 90 player rankings, there have been plenty of movement. Guard Jamal Murray rose 33 spots after helping lead the Denver Nuggets to the title and Sacramento Kings teammates Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox saw massive jumps. Meanwhile, stars such as Milwaukee Bucks forward Khris Middleton and New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson dropped due to injury-filled 2022-23 campaigns.\nBut none of those players matched the wild swings -- both up and down our list -- from the players below, starring a former MVP with an uncertain future, a three-time Defensive Player of the Year still figuring out his new team and a young guard who has vaulted into elite territory.\nOur NBA Insiders break down the top four risers and fallers inside the 2023 NBArank countdown.\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder\nNBArank: Top 10 (No. 48 last season)\nThe 2022-23 campaign was truly a breakout for SGA, who turned himself into a household name by averaging over 31.4 points per game, making his first All-Star appearance and earning his first All-NBA selection, jumping straight onto the first team. Gilgeous-Alexander followed that by leading Team Canada to a bronze medal with a win over Team USA at the FIBA World Cup last month.\nNow, he will be hoping to power the young Thunder back to the playoffs for the first time since the NBA's bubble season in 2020. Despite being a team so reliant on youth, he might just be good enough to do it.\nIf Gilgeous-Alexander is going to make yet another leap up this list, however, it's going to require him to at least begin filling the one remaining hole in his game: his lack of a consistent 3-point shot. Not only did he shoot 34.5% from deep last season, but he did so on just 2.5 attempts per game, both far below the norm for high-level guards. If Gilgeous-Alexander can combine his two-way ability and his lights-out midrange game with improved shooting from deep, he could become virtually unstoppable.\n-- Tim Bontemps\nLauri Markkanen, Utah Jazz\nNBArank: 28 (Not ranked last season)\nThe draft capital coming from Cleveland, not Markkanen, was considered the headliner of Utah's return in the Donovan Mitchell deal. The perception of Markkanen, a former No. 7 overall pick who the Chicago Bulls willingly let leave in a sign-and-trade deal the previous summer, was that he was a solid player whose $16.5 million salary was critical in making the trade math work. Five years into his career, terms like upside and potential didn't come up in conversations about Markkanen.\nBut Markkanen morphed into an All-Star during his first season in Utah, seizing opportunities to show that he was much more than the 7-foot spot-up shooter of his previous NBA stops. It started with his spectacular EuroBasket run for the Finland national team, when Markkanen excelled as the primary offensive threat, scoring in ways that Jazz coach Will Hardy hadn't seen from him in the NBA. Hardy, a rookie head coach for a rebuilding team, entered last season with an open mind and a determination to allow Markkanen to prove what he could do instead of assumptions about what he couldn't.\nMarkkanen responded by averaging an efficient 25.6 points per game, earning an All-Star spot and the league's Most Improved Player award.\n\"I don't know what the ceiling is on Lauri,\" Hardy said at the end of last season. \"I don't think any of us do, but I'm pretty sure we haven't seen it yet.\"\n-- Tim MacMahon\nPaolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\nNBArank: 30 (No. 82 last season)\nIt seems like a distant memory that the Magic debated in the lead-up to the 2022 draft about whether they should make Banchero the No.1 overall pick. From the first game of his NBA career, when he became the first rookie to debut with a 25-5-5 stat line since LeBron James, Banchero put those doubts to rest. From there, Banchero ran away with the Rookie of the Year award, averaging 20 points and 6.9 rebounds for Orlando, shutting down any doubts about him being the top selection and giving Magic fans a reason for optimism for the future. Banchero's size (6-10, 250 pounds), playmaking and scoring ability translated to the NBA immediately, and how much Banchero can continue to evolve will define the ceiling for this young team. If he follows other recent rookie 20-point scorers -- such as Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic or Zion Williamson -- and takes a leap to All-Star level in his second season, the Magic could start envisioning a postseason berth for the first time since the 2019-20 season. Then, Banchero could continue climbing this list as one of the most promising young players in the league.\n-- Jamal Collier\nFranz Wagner, Orlando Magic\nNBArank: 52 (Not ranked last season)\nHeading into last season, Wagner was coming off of a strong EuroBasket showing where he averaged 15.2 points across the competition. That turned into a standout sophomore campaign where he upped his scoring, field goal and 3-point percentages and assists and steals averages. Wagner was a key component in the Magic bouncing back from a 5-20 start to finish 29-28 and spreading optimism throughout the organization heading into 2023-24.\nWagner is again coming off a strong performance for Germany as he helped lead his squad to the FIBA World Cup championship. Now, he'll try and build upon that performance once again.\nThe respect shown to both Wagner and Banchero in the rankings exhibits how our panel feels about the prospects of the Magic this season. In our win-loss projections from August, the Magic were picked to finish 38-44 this season, good enough to place them in the Eastern Conference's play-in tournament.\nIf Wagner can build on his summer performance this offseason like he did previously, there's nothing stopping him from joining Banchero in the top third in next year's NBArank.\n-- Andrew Lopez\nChris Paul, Golden State Warriors\nNBArank: 76 (No. 21 last season)\nIn 2021-22, Paul showed he was still a force at point guard, averaging 14.7 points and a league-leading 10.8 assists per game at 36 years old. With the Suns just a season removed from a Finals appearance, there was reason to be high on what Paul could still do on the court.\nHowever, last year represented a step back. He played in just 59 games, shot 44.0% overall and watched his 2-point percentage dip to 48.2%. He didn't look like the same player but was still good enough to contribute at a high level.\nBut it won't be in Phoenix; Paul was dealt from the Valley of the Sun to Washington in the Bradley Beal deal but was flipped to Golden State for Jordan Poole.\n• Nos. 50-11: Wemby, Trae and Beal in top 50\n• Insiders: Who are biggest risers, fallers?\n• Nos. 100-51: Where's Zion?\n• Pelton: The next wave is coming\n• Coming Thursday: Nos. 10-1\nPaul took a 55-spot drop in this year's rankings in part because his role has become unclear entering this season. Will the Warriors go super small with Paul, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green in the starting lineup?\nPaul has never come off the bench in 1,214 career NBA games, but during media day earlier this month, he was quick to point out he came off the bench in the 2008 Olympics.\n\"I think anybody who knows me knows I'm all about winning,\" Paul said. \"Whatever I can do to help our team win.\"\nIn the Warriors' first preseason game, Paul did start, although Green did not play.\nWhatever role Paul finds himself in -- remaining a starter or becoming a Sixth Man of the Year candidate -- if he plays at the level he's capable, he'll be an asset to the Warriors title hopes and jump back near the top half of our countdown.\n-- Lopez\nCade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons\nNBArank: 74 (No. 35 last season)\nCunningham's second season in the NBA never really got underway.\nHe was limited to 12 games before a stress fracture in his left leg ended his season, leading to his freefall in this year's rankings. But 11 months after Cunningham last played in an NBA game, the Pistons' No.1 pick seems poised for a bounce-back season -- as long as he can stay on the floor.\nCunningham was impressive during his stint for the USA Select Team over the summer, drawing praise from Team USA coach Steve Kerr, who said Cunningham looked healthy and could control the game from the point guard spot with his physicality. At 6-foot-6 and 220 pounds, Cunningham has a unique combination of size and strength that made him a sub for Luka Doncic as the national team prepared over the summer.\nBefore his injury, Cunningham was averaging 19.9 points, 6.2 rebounds and 6.0 assists. If he can continue to hone those all-around skills, improve his shooting and find the right mix of passing and scoring aggressiveness, the Pistons should find much more success after finishing with the NBA's worst record.\n-- Collier\nRudy Gobert, Minnesota Timberwolves\nNBArank: 64 (No. 18 last season)\nThe exorbitant price the Timberwolves paid in the trade to get Gobert ensured that he arrived in Minnesota under immense pressure. His first season fell far short of justifying the cost of the blockbuster deal with the Jazz, who received four future first-round picks, a pair of role players and Walker Kessler, who proceeded to become a first-team All-Rookie selection.\nGobert's numbers slipped significantly during his first season in Minnesota. His scoring average (13.4 points per game) was his lowest since 2015-16, his first season as a starter. He averaged a respectable 11.6 rebounds per game, but that was a six-year low. The three-time Defensive Player of the Year didn't live up to his reputation as an elite rim protector either, averaging only 1.4 blocks per game, his fewest since he was sparingly used as a rookie in Utah. The analytics that measure impact -- numbers that had ranked Gobert among the league's elite for years -- were all down as well.\nThere were other legitimate reasons for Gobert's drop-off. He reported to training camp with knee soreness, which he suffered playing for France in EuroBasket and lingered into the season. He struggled adapting to new teammates and a new system, and injuries to teammates, particularly Karl-Anthony Towns' serious calf strain, disrupted efforts to develop chemistry and continuity.\n-- MacMahon\nJames Harden, Philadelphia 76ers\nNBArank: 43 (No. 11 last season)\nIn many ways, Harden was still a hugely effective player in 2022-23. He led the league in assists for the second time in his career and his pick-and-roll partnership with Joel Embiid was otherworldly, as he helped Embiid win a second straight scoring title and capture his first MVP.\nHarden had some breathtaking playoff performances, including his 45-point showing in Game 1 of the East semifinals against the Boston Celtics with Embiid sidelined.\nBut Harden's game showed slippage. He became far more reliant on midrange jumpers than he had over the prior decade, when he became synonymous with the analytically-friendly approach of going for layups, free throws and 3-pointers and eschewing other shots. But Harden lacked the same sort of burst, causing him to struggle to get by defenders and to the rim.\nWhile Harden is still a very valuable player, even as he's entering his mid-30s, the biggest reason for his 32-spot drop centers around where he'll be playing. He's made it clear he doesn't want to be in Philadelphia anymore, and has requested a trade away from the 76ers. The team hasn't granted it, and a deal doesn't seem likely anytime soon. So how Harden will react, and what it will mean for the 76ers, is the dominant storyline of his, and Philadelphia's season.\n-- Bontemps"}
