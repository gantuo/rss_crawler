{"title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens)", "date": "2022-02-06 10:04:00", "text": " \n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.\nNFT stands for non-fungible  token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.\nA blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.\nThe value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.\nOne of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain. \nAs with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network. \nNFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?\nAnyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations\nWhen you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.\nThe value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.\nIn the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.\nNon-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.\nMany people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.\nThere are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.\nTo mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.\nThe answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.\nYou can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.\nThat’s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening. I just answer some question with my limited knowledge about NFTs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop them in the comment section below. Also I have a question for you, Is bitcoin an NFTs? let me know in The comment section below\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you sell original (IRL) work with an NFT?\nyes you can scan it and sell it\nThanks.\nyou are welcome\nThank you for sharing this \n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Change out the background on a template to give it a more personal touch.\nThe Styles tab lets you quickly change the look and feel of your template with just a click. And if you have a Canva Pro subscription, you can upload your brand’s custom colors and fonts to ensure designs stay on brand.\nIf you have a Canva Pro subscription, you’ll have a Logos tab.

If you are a graphic designer with experience, you will find Canva’s platform lacking in customization and advanced features – particularly vectors. But if you have little design experience, you will find Canva easier to use than advanced graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator for most projects.

That will must be going to help me. Ready to share this article with others. Keep up the good work. \nvery informative\nYour blog help me more than twenty SEO & Marketing courses I paid on Udemy.I have a new audience question: is there any deep article about Site Content Structure for SEO? I see some guys tell about Pillar Pages, Silos, Cluster.. but I really wanna know your ideas about it.\nAs you’re writing more and more blog posts, or add more product pages, your site will get cluttered. You need to organize it neatly, to make sure you, your visitor AND Google will be able to find what they’re looking for.Why is that? Let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was a young woman. Her name is Alice. Every morning Alice gets up, sits down at her desk and starts writing a beautiful story. She writes one story a day. Alice types all her stories on this beautiful old-fashioned typewriter. Whenever she's done writing, she pulls the paper out of the machine and puts her lovely new story on her desk. As you can imagine, her desk will slowly get cluttered with all these sheets of paper. After a year of writing, she'll have 365 sheets of paper on it. After three years of writing, she'll have more than 1000. Alice will not be able to find her favorite story, because of the abundance of stories on her desk.If you do not structure your stuff neatly, your stories, your blog posts, your product pages will get lost. Your visitors will not be able to find what they are looking for, and, important for your SEO: Google will also get lost.Search on google or quora you will get your answer but if you still have question you can ask me here. you can also check yoast seo blog there's alot content about Site content structure\nYou explained well, structure is good. definitely it will give me great help to sell me plr product\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

I'll analyze each tool to see how they differ\nin interfaces, keyword research resources, rank tracking, and competitor\nanalysis.\nUser Interface\nAhrefs and SEMrush both offer comprehensive information\nand quick metrics regarding your website's SEO performance. However, Ahrefs\ntakes a bit more of a hands-on approach to getting your account fully set up,\nwhereas SEMrush's simpler dashboard can give you access to the data you need\nquickly.\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the elements\nfound on each dashboard and highlight the ease with which you can complete\ntasks.\nAHREFS\n\n\nThe Ahrefs dashboard is less cluttered than that of\nSEMrush, and its primary menu is at the very top of the page, with a search bar\ndesigned only for entering URLs.\nAdditional features of the Ahrefs platform include:\n\n\nSEMRUSH\n\n\nWhen you log into the SEMrush Tool, you will find four\nmain modules.

It also continues to\nadd new features, like the Keyword Gap tool and SERP Questions recommendations.\nBoth platforms offer competitor analysis tools,\neliminating the need to come up with keywords off the top of your head.

Market\nExplorer also allows users to perform in-depth data analytics on These\ncompanies and markets.\nSEMrush wins here because it has more tools dedicated to\ncompetitor analysis than Ahrefs. However, Ahrefs offers a lot of functionality\nin this area, too. It takes a combination of both tools to gain an advantage\nover your competition.\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to keyword data research, you will become\nconfused about which one to choose.\nConsider choosing Ahrefs if you\n\n\n\n\n \nConsider SEMrush if you:\n\n\nBoth tools are great.

Please keep sharing good articles.RegardsArslan\nYou are welcome stay tuned with us for future post\nSounds like you're biased for Grammarly. Not really that informative if you're already leaning towards one to begin with. Still, it was an interesting read. Tell me, do you use Grammarly with your day-to-day writing/blogging?\nYep\nI use the paid versions of both Grammarly and Pro Writing Aid. Both of them have issues:- Grammarly IS more focused on nonfiction than fiction. If you're writing fiction, you may find Grammarly's insistence on \"Conciseness\" annoying. They seem to want to take the soul out of your writing, which is fine for a corporate report or technical manual, but not for your Great American Novel.- Grammarly pushes features on users that are not ready for prime time. It doesn't matter that you never agreed to be a beta tester for them; you get to do it anyway.- Pro Writing Aid actually counts the occurrences of words in your document and tells you when a word has been overused compared to published literature. Grammarly, on the other hand, seems hell-bent to remove certain words that it has deemed overused from the language, whether or not they're actually overused in your document.- Grammarly's Clarity function is simply horrible. It mangles sentences and changes their meaning. Sometimes the result of its suggestion is unintelligible garbage.- Grammarly allows you to turn off some checks, but not all of them. Unfortunately, the ones you cannot turn off are some of the most irritating (such as that horrible \"Clarity\"). On the other hand, Pro Writing Aid lets you choose which checks you use.- Pro Writing Aid has a mediocre command of American English (it's a British product). The app insists on rules of grammar and spelling that are outright wrong, per Merriam-Webster, the Chicago Manual of Style, and modern usage as shown by Google Books Ngram. At one point, Pro Writing Aid insisted that American English did not include the words \"holiday\" and \"autumn,\" that \"vacation\" and \"fall\" must be used instead.- Pro Writing Aid's rules for commas are 100 percent consistent with the way I learned them in high school--50 years ago! They do not reflect modern usage. Grammarly is much better at this.- Pro Writing Aid seems to waste their limited resources on tweaking their UI. Their UI most definitely could use improvement, but these changes are not great improvements; they only serve to confuse users. Their resources would be better spent fixing the many functional problems in their app.- Some of Pro Writing Aid's checks are completely useless, as they do not take context into consideration. For example, an ordinary word would not be capitalized as part of a  narrative, but would be as part of a title (for example, \"professor.\" But if you capitalize correctly for context, Pro Writing Aid dings you for \"Inconsistent capitalization.\" Similar issues exist with hyphenation consistency check.Each of these applications has its strengths as well as considerable weaknesses. I will say that both of them are light-years better than the execrable grammar checker in Microsoft Word, but that's damning with faint praise.\nThanks for your review it will help the reader to understand more\nThanks for the information\nWelcome stay tuned for future post\nAmazing blog thanks for putting efforts into it got to know difference between these trending ai tools.\nWelcome stay tuned for future post\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"title": "What is Blockchain: Everything You Need to Know (2022)", "date": "2022-04-18 05:49:00", "text": "\nImagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.\nIt’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain. \nBlockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.\nA few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.\nA blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.\nBlockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.\nBlockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.\nTo understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:\n\n\nLet’s get to know more about the blockchain.\nBlockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.\nHere’s how it works:\n\n\nAnd that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.\n\n\nEven though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\nBlockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.\nAlthough some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.\nTracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.\nBlockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.\nBlockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.\nHave you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?\nBlockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.\nInstead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called “Decentralization,” meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.\nBlockchain guarantees your data's authenticity—not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.\nBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages. \n\n\n\n\nI’ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.\nBlockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.\nYes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.\nCoinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.\nBlockchain is a decentralized technology. It’s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device.

{"title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing", "date": "2022-06-01 13:03:00", "text": "\n\n\n\n Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!\n\n An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.\n Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.  Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.\n Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\n\n\n Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\n Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.\n The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.\n An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\n Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.\n A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.  Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.\n Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\n Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.\nAffiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:\n\n\n One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.\n Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:\n\n\n To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.\n Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.\nWho manages your affiliate program?\n Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.\n Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration\n The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its “cookie life.” The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you’ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.\n\n\n\nExcellent post. You have shared some wonderful tips. I completely agree with you that it is important for any blogger to help their visitors. Once your visitors find value in your content, they will come back for more.Thanks for sharing, have a good day.\nYou are welcome and stay tuned with us for future post\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks are Not allowed Comments containing links are deleted by the moderator Please read the comment policy page:https://www.crunchhype.com/p/comment-policy.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Choosing the best day and time to send an email is always a gamble.

The AI-based platform figures out the best timing and email frequency for each contact based on when they’re opening emails.
